With Thailand welcoming back foreign tourists to select destinations, Ulas Mehmet Isci is cautiously optimistic that his tourism business will finally recover after it came to a standstill starting early last year as the pandemic broke out.  We really hope that tourism is going to come back in the next five to six months, or perhaps over the coming year, said Isci, chief executive officer of Tropics Travel, which operates travel agencies throughout Thailand, including Koh Samui Tours, Chiang Mai Tours, Phuket Tours and Krabi Tours.  I see a sign of recovery, but the recovery may come a little slowly, Isci said. His business, in which tourist numbers dropped to zero at times over the past year, has recovered by only about  to  percent after Thailand began its reopening programs this month.  Following a program that began allowing vaccinated foreign tourists onto the resort island of Phuket starting on July , Thailand launched a similar program called Samui Plus on Thursday to enable travel to Koh Samui, the countrys secondlargest island after Phuket, via direct international flights or sealed routes from Bangkok.  The program requires tourists to stay at an approved hotel in Koh Samui for a week and stay within their accommodations for the first three days, the Tourism Authority of Thailand said.  Tourists with negative COVID test results will be allowed to travel to the neighboring islands of Koh Tao and Koh Phangan after their first week on Koh Samui.  Thai Minister of Tourism and Sports Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said the reopening of the three islands is another significant step toward achieving the goal set by Prime Minister Prayut Chanocha last month to reopen the whole country within  days, or by the end of October.  The tourism authority expects as many as , tourists to arrive in the first month and generate  million baht . million for the local economy.  The openingup of more islands comes even as Thailand experiences a rising number of COVID infections.  Mainly driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, the country recorded more than , daily cases in the  days to Sunday.  Significant risk  There is a significant risk in the Thai approach to reopening, given cases are not just increasing across the country but increasing aggressively, said Jeremy Lim, associate professor and director of global health of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at National University of Singapore.  Thailand has yet to achieve the necessary levels of vaccination, a key to successful reopening, Lim said. The country had administered about . million doses of COVID vaccines by Monday. It started the campaign in February. To realize its reopening plan, Thailand needs to have a threshold of  million people given first shots by early October.  Bill Barnett, managing director of hospitality consultancy C Hotelworks in Thailand, said he is still cautiously positive about Thailands reopening, given that only  people tested positive among about , travelers arriving in Phuket in the first two weeks.  kellychinadailyapac.com                 Thai public health officials travel by boat on Monday to bring COVID testing equipment to residents living in remote communities in Samut Prakan, near Bangkok, Thailand, amid the rise in coronavirus disease infections.
