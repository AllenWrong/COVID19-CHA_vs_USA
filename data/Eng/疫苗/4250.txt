The World Health Organizations directorgeneral said on Monday its COVAX plan, the global program for the fair distribution of future vaccines, would ensure priority goes to those most at risk. Speaking at a WHO news conference on Monday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said The overarching goal of the COVAX Facility is to ensure that all countries have access to vaccines at the same time, and that priority is given to those most at risk, including health workers, older people and others at the highest risk. Tedros said that the plan will help bring the pandemic under control and stressed that the race for a vaccine is a global effort and not a contest that only the rich can win.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
