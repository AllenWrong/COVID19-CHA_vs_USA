EU assures Britain over vaccine supplies

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has assured United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any COVID vaccine producer in the European Union after a highprofile supply dispute.A political storm blew up when vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca said it could not meet its contractual obligation to the member EU, and the commission responded by demanding that the company divert supplies put aside for the United Kingdom, whose own contract was agreed earlier, and whose supply and use had already begun.Tensions rose further when, less than a month after the Brexit process was completed, the commission announced plans to introduce checks at the border between EU member state the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, part of the UK, the avoidance of which was a key element of the Brexit agreement. This drew international criticism and was subsequently withdrawn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
