Country to provide  billion in international aid over  years to support economic recovery                     President Xi Jinping highlighted on Friday the need for AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation economies to enhance solidarity and cooperation to overcome the impact of COVID and boost global economic recovery, as he announced a package of aid measures for other developing nations.  China will provide another  billion in international aid over the next three years to support COVID response and economic and social recovery in other developing countries, the president announced in a speech delivered via video link at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders Retreat.  The president put forward Chinas proposals in four aspects, noting that controlling the pandemic still poses a difficult challenge and global economic recovery is still on shaky ground. He urged APEC economies to strengthen international cooperation on COVID response and to adopt effective measures to ensure healthy, safe and orderly peopletopeople exchanges and restore normal business cooperation at an early date.  Xi reiterated the importance of promoting the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment and upholding the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core.  The president also stressed the importance of seizing opportunities in scientific and technological innovation, noting that the digital economy is an important area for the future growth of the world economy.  Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist at Griffith University in Australia, said Xis speech demonstrated Chinas commitment to supporting global vaccine cooperation and in waiving the intellectual property rights on COVID vaccine.  Budiman said this is very important for lower and middleincome countries, many of them in Asia and in Africa, as it will give their population protection from the virus.  Xi also called for global cooperation to end the pandemic. Its time for all countries to have strong collaboration, because we cant let other countries be left behind, Budiman said.  Andy Brooks, general secretary of the New Communist Party of Britain, hailed Chinas leading role in tackling the global pandemic and providing immense assistance to other countries in the battle against the coronavirus.  We are indeed a global village, and, if we stand together, we can overcome the COVID plague. Hopefully, the countries of the industrialized West will now support the Chinese proposal to waive intellectual property rights on COVID vaccines to speed the global recovery, Brooks said.  Dennis Munene, executive director of the ChinaAfrica Center at the Africa Policy Institute, said Xis remarks sent a message against the incoming order of vaccine imperialism, advocating for peaceful cooperation among civilizations in a time of adversity.  To defeat the coronavirus and boost vaccination worldwide, Munene said, China has pledged to work with other parties and take an active part in cooperation initiatives to keep vaccine supply chains stable and safe and support the movement of essential goods, through adhering to the principles of multilateralism.  Yuzo Tanaka, a professor of economics at Ryukoku University in Kyoto, said Chinas pledge to set up an APEC fund for pandemic response will facilitate a speedy and balanced recovery between haves and havenots.  He added that the move is in the common interests and moral duty of all APEC members because some countries in the region are quick in vaccination and restarting the economy, while others are scrambling for vaccines, suffering from recurrent surges of infections and lagging behind in economic recovery.  Ronnie Lins, director of the ChinaBrazil Center for Research and Business, said Xis speech is of great significance as it provides a feasible plan for the international community to cooperate in fighting the COVID pandemic and promoting economic recovery.  As to the negative impact of COVID on the world economy, Lins said that only by promoting multilateralism can the global economy recover sooner, adding that the Chinaproposed Belt and Road Initiative will help enhance cooperation among countries along the routes.  Joe Thomas Karackattu, associate professor at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences and faculty incharge of the China Studies Center at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, said Xis focus on the revival of economic growth under the current circumstances was encouraging.  This is encouraging as he focused on many opportunities that are present even in the middle of the pandemic. The opportunities include the rise of digital economies, more vaccine outreach, and other tourism opportunities, Karackattu said.  Wayne Huang, principal of the Institute of Commercial Education New Zealand, expressed his belief that China will play an important role in promoting an inclusive, sustainable and resilient recovery in the AsiaPacific region and the rest of the world.  Chinas rapidly developing economy and its large consumer base provide a huge market for the AsiaPacific region and the rest of the world, he said.
