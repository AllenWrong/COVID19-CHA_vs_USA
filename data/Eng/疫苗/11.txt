Chief Secretary John Lee Kachiu will attend the meeting on behalf of the SAR government, Lam added. On Saturday, a delegation of experts organized by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the National Health Commission arrived in Hong Kong for a fourday visit to learn about local antipandemic efforts and measures. Speaking to media ahead of the weekly executive meeting, Lam said that the mainland experts visit is crucial to an early and orderly resumption of quarantinefree crossborder travel. She noted that the delegation has examined in detail the antipandemic measures in major facilities related to antipandemic work, including checkpoints, healthcare facilities, quarantine centers and contact tracing offices. Lam added that a circuitbreaker mechanism will surely exist if quarantinefree travel resumes as there would still be possible community outbreaks resulting from imported COVID cases. Lam called on people to get vaccinated, in a bid to accelerate the process of an early quarantinefree border reopening with the Chinese mainland as well as overseas nations. Hong Kongs firstshot vaccination rate is yet to reach  percent, she said. Also Lam will embark for Wuhan city of Hubei province this Sunday to attend a highlevel meeting with provincial leaders of Hubei to discuss a cooperative mechanism. Starting Dec , a delegation of about  national Olympian medalists will visit Hong Kong for three days, including the renowned table tennis player Ma Long and the sprint star Su Bingtian, the first Chinese runner to make it to the Olympic meter final.
