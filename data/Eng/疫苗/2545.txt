As of midnight Saturday, Yunnan had a total of  confirmed cases and  asymptomatic cases. All of them are receiving treatment or are under medical observation in designated hospitals in the province All confirmed and asymptomatic cases were found in the border city of Ruili during a citywide nucleic acid testing campaign, the commission said. Yunnan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention discovered that the whole genome sequence of the new coronavirus in Ruili epidemic is highly homologous to that in Myanmar, so it is highly possible that the virus found in Ruili is imported from the neighboring country. The virus found in Ruili has no correlation with the genome of the virus of the local cluster epidemic caused by imported cases in other places in the country, indicating that it is not the secondary transmission caused by the local epidemics in various parts of the country recently, according to the Yunnan health commission briefing on Saturday.
