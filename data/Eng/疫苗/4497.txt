Govt to buy m doses against backdrop of rising job losses caused by pandemic                                             The British government has agreed to buy  million doses of novel coronavirus vaccines being developed by the pharmaceutical companies BioNtech, Pfizer, and Valneva, despite the jabs not yet being proved to work. The deal, which was announced on Monday, is in addition to one the government reached for  million doses of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. The United Kingdom has invested heavily in the development of a vaccine that protects against the novel coronavirus, and has said social distancing, frequent handwashing, and the wearing of face masks must remain in place until such a vaccine can be developed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
