UK trials will reexpose people to COVID

People who have recovered from COVID will be deliberately reexposed to the novel coronavirus that causes it in medical trials that start this week in the United Kingdom. The socalled challenge trials, which are being led by the University of Oxford, will look at how much protection people have against reinfection and against developing the disease a second time. The Reuters news agency reported that the study, which started on Monday, differs from challenge trials approved in February by medical regulators and conducted by Imperial College London, which involve people not previously infected with the virus. The information from this work will allow us to design better vaccines and treatments, and also to understand if people are protected after having COVID and for how long, said Helen McShane, a University of Oxford vaccinologist and chief investigator on the latest study, according to Reuters. She said scientists also hope to understand which immune responses protect against reinfection. Researchers will start by seeking the lowest dose of novel coronavirus needed to cause an infection in someone who has previously been infected. They hope that, by establishing the level of antibodies needed to fight off reinfection, they will open the door to faster vaccine approvals, because vaccines that trigger an immune response at the identified level will be known to be adequate. The first phase of the Oxford trials will involve up to  healthy participants aged between  and  who had COVID at least three months before they will be given low doses of the virus. The second phase, which will be held during the summer, will involve people being given larger doses. The Times newspaper in London said that the subjects will each earn , pounds , for their participation. They will have to spend  days in a hospital and undergo regular followup appointments for  months. Previous observational studies have suggested that very few people who have been previously infected with the novel coronavirus subsequently test positive for COVID. McShane said on BBC Radio s Today program that she is confident that those taking part will not be in serious danger and will not run the risk of developing long COVID, in which patients experience longterm effects. To the best of our knowledge, we think the risk of that is extremely unlikely, she said. And the reason for that is these people have already had one infection with COVID, where they fully recovered from it. The Times quoted Chris Chiu, the professor who is leading the Imperial College London challenge trials, as saying the two pieces of research should combine to show how reinfection differs from a first infection with this virus, which may have important implications for how the pandemic is managed. The BBC said participants in the Oxford trials, which are being funded by the Wellcome Trust, will be exposed to a laboratorygrown virus that is the same as the original strain of novel coronavirus. Challenge trials have previously been used to increase scientists understanding of other diseases, such as cholera, influenza, malaria and typhoid. earlemail.chinadailyuk.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
