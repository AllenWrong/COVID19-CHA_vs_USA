At the same time, we are determined to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.It is natural that China and the US may disagree on certain issues, Zhang said, but he suggested that despite their different cultures, histories and social systems, China and the US should coexist peacefully.The key to peaceful coexistence is mutual respectrespect for each others history, culture and traditions, their core interests and major concerns, their choice of political system and development path, as well as the basic norms governing international relations, such as noninterference in internal affairs and peaceful settlement of disputes, Zhang said.He said the two countries have important converging interests in wideranging areas, such as climate change, COVID response, world economic recovery and maintaining regional peace and stability.Zhang spoke of the telephone conversation between President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden on Feb , and called on the two countries to take the phone call as an opportunity to enhance communication, focus on cooperation, manage differences and steadily advance ChinaUS relations.Speaking of Chinas vaccine cooperation, Zhang said Chinas efforts to promote international cooperation against COVID are not driven by any geopolitical agenda, nor does it come with any political strings.In the face of the pandemic, nothing matters more than peoples lives, safety and health, Zhang said. We hope more countries that have the capacity to take action can provide vaccines to the international community, especially developing countries, in order to boost global efforts against COVID.The Chinese government has been providing vaccine assistance to over  countries in total, and so far it has also committed to provide  million doses of vaccine to the COVAX vaccine distribution plan to meet the urgent needs of developing countries, according to Zhang.He said while it is important that vaccines are distributed and used around the world in an equitable manner, it is particularly important to ensure developing countries have access to affordable, safe and effective vaccines.For this to happen, the international community needs to work together, he said.
