More than  academics including  Nobel laureates have signed an open letter in support of controversial COVID studies where paid volunteers would be intentionally exposed to the novel coronavirus in order to speed up vaccine development.The letter came as the team behind ChAdOx nCoV, which is more commonly known as the Oxford vaccine, confirmed for the first time that it is exploring the use of socalled human challenge trials, which could be up and running in the coming months.In these trials, volunteers are given a candidate vaccine, exposed to a pathogen, and then monitored in a quarantine facility. These studies have an advantage over traditional field trials because researchers can guarantee that people who have been given the vaccine will come into contact with the disease, thus testing vaccine efficacy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
