PhotoXinhua    LONDON  Chinesemade COVID vaccines have helped some emerging countries achieve impressive vaccination rates, in some cases faster than richer economies, said a British research report Wednesday. The Economist Intelligence Unit, research and analysis division of Economist Group, said in its latest report that more than seven billion shots have been administered around the world as of late October. However, developed countries have succeeded in vaccinating large percentages of their populations, while many developing states have made only negligible progress. In some emerging economies, like Chile and Cambodia, most population has been inoculated thanks to Chinas help, noted the report. Data showed Chile now posts one of the highest vaccination rates worldwide with  percent, and one of the reasons is that Chile secured huge supplies of Chinesemade Sinovac jab early on and Sinovac had become the vaccine of choice in Chile and was used for  percent of shots. Chile is not an isolated case many other Latin American countries, including El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay, are also relying on Chinese vaccines, added the report. It also showed that by October Cambodia had achieved one of the highest inoculation rates worldwide, with nearly  percent of Cambodian residents vaccinated, ahead of all other Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries, except Singapore. Cambodias ability to inoculate a large share of its population shows that vaccination success stories exist in emerging states, with Chinas help, said Agathe Demarais, author of the report.
