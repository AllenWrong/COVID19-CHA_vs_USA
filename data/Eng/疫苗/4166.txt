PhotoXinhua    LONDON  A Chinese COVID vaccine candidate based on the inactivated whole SARSCoV virus is safe and elicits an antibody response, according to the findings from a small earlyphase randomised clinical trial published Thursday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal. The latest study included participants aged between  and  years, and found that antibody responses were induced in all recipients. Participants aged  and older were slower to respond, taking  days before antibodies were detected in all recipients compared with  days for participants aged . The trial was not designed to assess efficacy of the vaccine, so it is not possible to say whether the antibody responses induced by the vaccine, called BBIBPCorV, are sufficient to protect people from SARSCoV infection. The authors also noted that interpretation of the results of this study is limited by the short duration of followup. According to The Lancet, there are currently  vaccines for COVID in clinical trials. Vaccine candidates in clinical trials vary in type and include DNA plasmid vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines, adenovirusvectored vaccines, RNA vaccines, protein subunit vaccines and viruslike particle vaccines. Some of these have already proved safe and able to elicit immune responses in early phase clinical trials. Our findings indicate that a booster shot is necessary to achieve the greatest antibody responses against SARSCoV and could be important for protection. This provides useful information for a phase  trial, said Yang Xiaoming, one of the authors of the study and a professor from the Beijing Institute of Biological Products.
