People who have recovered from COVID will be deliberately reexposed to the novel coronavirus that causes the disease in medical trials that start this week in the United Kingdom.The socalled challenge trials, which are being led by the University of Oxford, will look at how much protection people have against reinfection and against developing the disease for a second time.The Reuters news agency said the study, which started on Monday, differs from challenge trials approved in February by the medical regulator, which are being conducted by Imperial College London because they involve people who have not previously been infected with the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
