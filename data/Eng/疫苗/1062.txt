The head of the World Health Organization, or WHO, warned that cases and deaths from COVID have continued to rise, with almost  million cases reported to the organization last week.Its expected the total number of cases will pass  million within the next two weeks, which the WHO said is an underestimate.Speaking at a media briefing on Friday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, directorgeneral of the WHO, revealed that COVID infections have increased by  percent in five of the organizations six regions, nearly doubling over the past four weeks.In Africa, deaths have increased by  percent over the same period, Tedros said, adding that the highlytransmissible Delta variant, which has now been detected in at least  countries, is the main cause for the increase.WHO has warned that the COVID virus has been changing since it was first reported, and it continues to change. So far, four variants of concern have emerged, and there will be more as long as the virus continues to spread, he said.He noted that the rise is also driven by increased social mixing and mobility, inconsistent use of public health and social measures, and inequitable vaccine use.Hardwon gains are in jeopardy or being lost, and health systems in many countries are being overwhelmed, he said. The increased number of COVID infections is creating a shortage of treatments,such as lifesaving oxygen. Twentynine countries have high and rising oxygen needs, and many countries have inadequate supplies of basic equipment to protect frontline healthworkers.Testing rates in lowincome countries are now less than  percent compared wihighincome countries, which Tedros said is leaving the world blind to understanding where the disease is and how the virus is changing.He stressed that without better testing rates the world will struggle to fight the disease on the front line and also mitigate the risk of new and more dangerous variants emerging.Tedros called for stronger surveillance and more strategic testing to understand where the virus is, as well as to find out where public health interventions are most needed.The WHOs goal remains to support every country to vaccinate at least  percent of its population by the end of September, at least  percent by the end of this year, and  percent by the middle of next year, but Tedros said those targets are still a long way off.In the effort to develop more vaccines, the WHO has signed a letter of intent that sets out the terms of collaboration with the Medicines Patent Pool Afrigen Biologics the Biologicals and Vaccines Institute of Southern Africa the South African Medical Research Council and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.The letter comes after the WHO announced the development of a technology transfer hub for mRNA vaccines in South Africa last month, as part of efforts to scale up production of vaccines.
