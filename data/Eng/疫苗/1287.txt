This is the first time in APECs history that leaders have held an extraordinary meeting at leaders level, and it reflects our desire to navigate together out of the COVID pandemic and economic crisis, said Ardern. Responding collectively is vital to accelerate the economic recovery for the region, Ardern said, adding, Our region has already responded in significant ways, including removing barriers to the efficient distribution of vaccines and related goods, but there is still a lot of work to do to get through the crisis. Leaders will share information so we can continue to build on our collective understanding of the regions health response to COVID, and shape a collaborative economic response, she continued. Containing COVID through rapid, safe, and effective vaccination micro and macroeconomic policy settings to sustain businesses and workers and building more resilient, inclusive and sustainable economies will all be on the agenda, explained Ardern. Rebecca Sta Maria, the APEC Secretariats executive director, emphasized that the pandemic provides more opportunities for greater cooperation among APEC economies to ensure every economy recovers sustainably and inclusively from the crisis. The upcoming APEC Informal Leaders Retreat is the first one in the forums history, and it is necessary for pushing forward our collective effort toward the regions recovery, Sta Maria said.
