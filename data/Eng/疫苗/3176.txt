Unfortunately, as the virus spreads it can also mutate, he said in an interview. Every time it mutates, its almost like another click of the dial so to speak where we can see another variant, another mutation that can have an impact on its ability to fend off antibodies or to have a different kind of response not only to a therapeutic but also to a vaccine, he added. Last week, Johnson  Johnson said it asked US health regulators to authorize its singledose COVID vaccine for emergency use, and added it will apply to European authorities in the coming weeks. The drugmakers application to the US Food and Drug Administration FDA followed its Jan.  report in which it said the vaccine had a  rate of preventing infections in its large global trial. Gorsky told CNBC the company was extremely confident that it will meet its target to deliver  million doses of its coronavirus vaccine to the United States by the end of June. JJ is continuing work on a twodose coronavirus vaccine, Gorsky said. It expects twoshot vaccine data from clinical trials in the second half of the year, he added. Reuters
