The coronavirus pandemic has strengthened cooperation between Russia and China, and created new opportunities for joint efforts, says Igor Sagitov, the consul general of the Russian Federation in Hong Kong. Its crucial for Russia to step up ties with the Chinese mainland and the Hong Kong SAR in order to seize the opportunities, particularly in medicine, innovation and technology, and the environment, he told China Daily in an interview marking the th anniversary of the end of World War II. The envoy stressed the need for international collaboration to seek solutions to the black swan event, the COVID outbreak, saying this is important in tackling the pandemic and future medical crises. The world, he said, has become interdependent and interconnected and that people must work with one another to solve global problems. Sagitov noted the enduring ties between Russia and China, as well as the joint efforts by both countries that played a crucial role in achieving final victory and the resumption of world peace during World War II. Against the backdrop of COVID, Russia and China have intensified cooperation, working towards greater achievements in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, he said. He spoke highly of Chinas success in controlling the coronavirus and extending help to other countries in their efforts to curb the disease. The Russian Ministry of Health sent five epidemiology experts to Wuhan in February to carry out research on vaccines in cooperation with their Chinese counterparts. It also sent  tons of medicine and personal protective equipment, including  million face masks, to Wuhan. China reciprocated last month by sending humanitarian cargo to Russia, along with a medical team, to share their experiences in fighting the outbreak. The Chinese team helped to implement control measures, provided medical aid, visited local hospitals, and exchanged treatment protocols. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia had received  million face masks from China by late April. Sagitov also noted that leading Hong Kong property developer, Henderson Development, has donated one million medical masks to the Moscow City government. The pandemic knows no borders, does not discriminate by nationality or any other factor, so now were talking about the importance of concerted joint action, he said. According to Sagitov, about , Russian nationals currently live in Hong Kong, mostly involved in the tourism, logistics and importexport sectors, as well as trade shows. He said it has been a hard time for them, having suffered along with everyone else due to the pandemic, and many of them have lost their jobs and income.Bilateral cooperation between Russia and the HKSAR has been severely affected in such fields as aviation, logistics, travel and trading, Sagitov noted.He said trading turnover between Russia and Hong Kong had fallen by nearly onethird in the first three months of this year, compared to the same period in . At the same time, there has been a significant increase in demand for medical equipment, personal protective gear and products for health services, he noted. Sagitov stressed that Russia fully supports the efforts of Chinas central government and the HKSAR government, which have proven successful in combating COVID. He observed that most of the new Hong Kong infections were imported rather than locally transmitted. Looking ahead, the diplomat cited the green corridors initiative proposed by Putin at the recent online G summit. Green corridors would be free from trade wars and sanctions to relieve supply pressures on countries in urgent need of medicines, food, necessary equipment and technology, he said. We hope that, through the joint efforts of the world community, well soon be able to curb the spread of COVID and direct all our efforts to overcoming the negative economic consequences of the pandemic, Sagitov said. Russia marks the th anniversary of the end of the Second World War on Saturday. Each year in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities in China, Russian and Chinese people pay tribute to those who had fought against fascism and tyranny. Last year, the Immortal Regiment campaign was held for the first time in Hong Kong, attended by about  people. This years event will be more subdued due to the pandemic. But there will be a series of online events and exhibitions, Sagitov added.heshusichinadailyhk.com                                                                                !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
