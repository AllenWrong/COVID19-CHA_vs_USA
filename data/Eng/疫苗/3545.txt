Vaccines free, safe and effective
2021-01-12 00:00
The official announcement over the weekend that COVID vaccines will be provided to the general public free of charge should have come as no surprise, given that the government has vowed repeatedly to make them a public good once they become available. The central leadership views the move as vital for building a strong line of defense against the novel coronavirus, and part of Chinas contribution to the global pandemic fight. Yet due to the lack of publicity, as well as the failure of some local government officials to carry out the policy properly by charging recipients for the vaccines before they were asked to rectify the practice, there has been some confusion among the public about the vaccination program that the government is carrying out. Since vaccines remain the most effective way to protect people from the disease, it is important to make sure that people throughout the country are willing to be inoculated, by ensuring they are well informed of the nocost policy and the fact that the vaccines being provided by the government have proved both safe and effective. China has already administered more than  million COVID vaccine doses, more than  million of them after midDecember, with only two people in a million suffering an adverse reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
