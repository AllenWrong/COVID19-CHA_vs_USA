A third wave of COVID is spreading at an alarming rate in Africa, with hospitals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Zambia overwhelmed with patients, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said.The third wave peak is brutal and swift and remarkably higher than the second wave. It has come in with severity that most countries were not prepared for. In Zambia, it took three to four weeks for the country to be overwhelmed, said John Nkengasong, director of the Africa CDC.This is the first time we are beginning to see countries report that their hospitals are completely overwhelmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
