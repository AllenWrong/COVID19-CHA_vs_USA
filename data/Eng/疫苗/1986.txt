The DPP authority ignores the health and wellbeing of Taiwan people, and fabricates absurd reasons to refuse the vaccines and kits, practicing dark politics, said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. She made the remarks in response to a question concerning the shortage of vaccines in Taiwan, where many people are eagerly awaiting donations of vaccines and kits from the mainland. We attach great importance to the lives and health of Taiwan compatriots, and Taiwan compatriots who live in the mainland are treated equally when it comes to vaccine use, she said. On May , The World Health Organization WHO approved the COVID vaccine developed by Chinas Sinopharm for emergency use, making it the sixth vaccine to receive WHO approval for its safety, efficacy and quality.
