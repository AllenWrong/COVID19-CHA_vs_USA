Chen Wei, a key figure behind the vaccine and a researcher at the Institute of Military Medicine of the Academy of Military Sciences, told China Central Television that data shows a single dose should provide protection for six months, and there is no need to take an additional shot during the sixmonth period. We also created booster shots for inoculation after six months, and with a single booster, we can increase the immune response by  to  times. Based on available data, we estimate two shots can provide protection for two years, she said. The AdnCoV vaccine was jointly developed by CanSino Biologics and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. The three other Chinesemade vaccines to get conditional approval for market use were inactivated vaccines produced by Sinovac and Sinopharm. The other singledose COVID vaccine in latestage clinical trials that released data is the vaccine developed by Johnson  Johnson.
