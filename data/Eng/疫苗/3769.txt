China is expected to lead the global economic recovery next year, with major economic organizations and economists projecting a robust performance by Chinas economy and foreign businesses remaining committed to the Chinese market.  With the country having adopted effective measures to put the COVID pandemic under control and its economy continuing to bounce back in recent months, the organizations and economists have expressed confidence in a stronger economic performance from China, which will inject key momentum into the global recovery and growth next year.  On Friday, a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Partys core leadership, underlined the need to maintain economic growth within a reasonable range, adhere to the strategy of expanding domestic demand and pursue a higher level of openingup.  China, which started recovering earlier, is projected to grow strongly, accounting for over onethird of world economic growth in , said Laurence Boone, chief economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, at the release of the organizations Economic Outlook earlier this month.  A solid recovery is expected to continue in China, with GDP growth projected to be around  percent in  and  percent in , the organization said in the report.  It added that Chinas strong recovery will help global GDP return to precrisis levels by the end of next year. The recovery in industrial production in China has also boosted demand for many raw materials in commodity exporting economies, particularly metals.  It said Chinas policymakers are now withdrawing its monetary stimulus, which was needed during the outbreak, as the economic recovery has gained momentum in recent months.  The National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday that Chinas growth in industrial value added increased  percent yearonyear in November, from . percent in October. Retail sales, a key gauge of consumption, were up  percent yearonyear, the fastest level of the year, the bureau said.  The inflow of foreign investment to China grew . percent yearonyear to . billion yuan . billion between January and November, according to the Ministry of Commerce.  The OECD projected that Chinas fiscal policy will remain supportive, with a number of tax cuts and extensions of social benefits promoting consumption amid weak consumer confidence.  However, the organization said that more ambitious structural reforms in social protection, and a more equitable provision of public services, are needed for consumption to rebound.  Lu Ting, chief China economist at Japanese brokerage Nomura Securities, said a rebound of global demand will enable Chinas exports to maintain a high rate of growth, underpinning the growth of the economy.  There is a great chance that vaccines will be used on a large scale globally, which will greatly ease the impact of the pandemic. During this process, we believe a global economic recovery is on the horizon, he said.  Fitch Ratings, a global credit rating agency, forecast in a research document early this month that Chinas economic recovery will be increasingly wellbalanced in , after successful containment of the coronavirus, and with many activity indicators now at prepandemic levels.  Fitch also predicted improved growth outlooks in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and Taiwan, saying that economic activity in these markets will be supported by stronger growth on the Chinese mainland, which will provide a boost to exports and, potentially, a partialrecovery in tourism through restricted travel bubbles.  Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, a British think tank, said he expects spending by Chinas private sector to step up in , while policy support retreats as the countrys economic recovery matures.  We expect Chinas growth to rotate in , with momentum picking up in household consumption and corporate investment, while investment in infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, real estate, slows down, he said.  Meanwhile, foreign businesses in the Chinese market have remained resilient, optimistic and committed to that market despite disruptions from the pandemic in .  A survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai in November, which polled  United States companies, said about  percent of respondents had no plans to move their manufacturing facilities offshore over the next three years.  A survey of British businesses in China, conducted by the British Chamber of Commerce in China, found that  percent of the companies cited market potential as a reason to increase investment in China in .  China was the No  priority for  percent of the chambers surveyed businesses, and a second or third priority for a further  percent, the chamber said in the report, which was released this month.  Given its size and importance to the global economy, China remains a top investment destination for British businesses already inmarket, it said.  xuweichinadaily.com.cn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
