Well done, the two Taiwan companies and a charity entity that secured COVID vaccine supplies from the Chinese mainland. And congratulations to the residents of Taiwan, who have received a substantial boost to their difficult fight against the resurging pandemic. Shame on the Democratic Progressive Party administration which had obstructed the process of crossStraits vaccine supply out of political calculations and partisan interests attempting to seek political gains by taking advantage of the pandemic. Despite all the nasty politics by the DPP, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, and Yonglin Charity Foundation have signed a vaccine sales agreement with a subsidiary of the Shanghaibased Fosun Pharmaceutical. Under the agreement, Fosun will provide  million doses of an mRNA COVID vaccine to the three Taiwan entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
