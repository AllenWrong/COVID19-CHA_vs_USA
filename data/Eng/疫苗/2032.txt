LISBON, PortugalEuropean Union leaders cranked up their criticism of the US call to waive COVID vaccine patents on Saturday, arguing the move would yield no shortterm or intermediate improvement in vaccine supplies and could even have a negative impact.The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday that leaders of EU countries understand there are more pressing issues than waiving patents on vaccines against COVID. She made the remarks at the end of the twoday social summit of the European Union held in the Portuguese city of Porto.Speaking to journalists, von der Leyen said the topic is important, but will be discussed in the long term, not in the short or medium term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
