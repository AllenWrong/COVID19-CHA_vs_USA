There was no logistical excuse for botching the vaccinations, Ackman, CEO of the hedge fund Pershing Square, wrote in a followup tweet. If Elon Musk can deliver k Teslas and Jeff Bezos can provide samehour delivery, we can vaccinate every American. The time is now! he tweeted, referring to the CEOs of Tesla and Amazon. Moreover, Ackman also commented that the mismanagement of the vaccine seems like genocide of the elderly. We are killing the Greatest Generation ... If the virus killed mostly children rather than the aged, would we sit back and allow this to happen? he wrote, referring to ageism. US COVID deaths surpassed , on Wednesday, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. As of Monday, fewer than five million people in the US had been vaccinated. Ackmans Pershing Square fund posted a  percent return last year, much of which was realized from the firms anticipation of the viruss devastating effects on business early in the year through creditdefault swaps, according to Business Insider.
