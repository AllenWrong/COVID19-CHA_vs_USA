BELGRADEChinas transfer of vaccine production technology to Serbia is vital for the country and demonstrates a willingness to share scientific achievements in order to help the world fight COVID, Serbian scientist Jelena Begovic said on Saturday.Begovic, director of the Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering of the University of Belgrade, said that a Chinese vaccine will soon be produced in Serbia.The construction of the production facility started in Serbia on Thursday, and it will be completed by the end of March . The plant will make a vaccine from Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm.I think that China gave a significant contribution  Chinas sharing helps Serbia make more progress in technology, science, and medicine, Begovic said.The global system so far includes only a limited number of players or vaccine producers. That has turned out to be not so efficient. We have to build a very strong network of production facilities all around the world.So Im definitely backing the idea that big players in the pharmaceutical industry should help smaller countries, if we want to win this battle or at least control the situation.Around a year ago, Begovic participated in the construction of two new Fire Eye laboratories for PCR testing and witnessed Chinas assistance to Serbia in medical supplies.We built two Fire Eye laboratories for PCR testing on coronavirus  I am very thankful that our collaboration is continuing at this level, Begovic said.China has been providing COVID vaccines to other countries in need since last year, including through donations and commercial arrangements. Beijing aims to provide  billion vaccine doses to the world this year to honor its commitment to make the vaccine a global public good.In Brunei, , doses of the Sinopharm vaccine provided by the Chinese government arrived at Brunei International Airport on Sunday midnight.A handover ceremony was held at the airport, attended by Haji Erywan, Bruneis second minister of foreign affairs, and Yu Hong, the Chinese ambassador to Brunei.On Monday, China delivered an additional batch of Sinovac vaccine doses to the Philippines to support the countrys vaccination campaign.Xinhua                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
