Having tightened its belt, Chinese Super League returns to embrace a more frugal future                                            Even before a ball was kicked at Tianhe Sports Center in Guangzhou on Tuesday, the Chinese Super Leagues new era of frugality was obvious for all to see.Gone was the usual lavish opening ceremony for the new season, to be replaced by a much shorter and modest affair, suggesting the Chinese Football Association is serious about delivering on its promise of a more sustainable future for the domestic game.A lack of expensive foreign players in the starting XIs for Tuesdays match between Guangzhou FC and Guangzhou City, however, was the clearest indication that the CSLs bigspending days are over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
