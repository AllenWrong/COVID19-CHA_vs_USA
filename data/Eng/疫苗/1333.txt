Antibodies against the novel coronavirus can last at least  months in more than  percent of recovered COVID patients, a study published by Chinese researchers on Tuesday showed.The finding adds to growing evidence that vaccination, which elicits immune response in a way similar to how a live virus triggers generation of antibodies, can effectively restrict the spread of SARSCoV, the study said.The study was conducted by China National Biotech Group under Sinopharm and the National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai Jiaotong University. It was published online by Nature Communications.The study collected , convalescent plasma samples from  recovered COVID patients in Wuhan, Hubei province within  months after diagnosis, and tested these samples for the presence of RBDIgG, a type of antibody that strongly indicates strength of immunity against the virus.Testing results show in nine months, levels of the antibody dropped to . percent of the initial level when they first contracted the virus, and then stabilized until the th month.It shows once immunity against the novel coronavirus is induced in human bodies, antibody levels can maintain for quite a long time, CNBG, one of the institutes conducting the research, said in an article released on its WeChat account on Wednesday.The study is so far the longestrunning study aimed at tracking antibody levels in recovered COVID patients, the company said, adding the new finding will boost confidence in fighting against the disease.
