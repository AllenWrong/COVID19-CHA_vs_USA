Soon we will have the results and we are very positive it will do the job, Covas said. Covas was speaking at a news conference in the small city of Serrana, in the interior of Sao Paulo state, where Butantan began on Wednesday a mass vaccination campaign aimed at inoculating the entire adult population against COVID to test whether it lowers the infection rate.
