More intensive cooperation between Europe and China in the field of science and research should continue, primarily to ensure larger quantities of COVID vaccines, he said, adding that the Chinese experience in the field of ecology and sustainable development will be valuable to everyone in Europe. Jelena Begovic, director of the Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering of University of Belgrade, Serbia, said Chinas initiative to gather these countries and make a wall, a battlefield to beat this pandemic is a great idea, adding that I think its the only way if we want to win this war. If the international community can strengthen ties between countries and try to find more countries to involve, Begovic said, it would be great and we have to come to some mutual solutions on the global level or just start at a regional level. Andrey Shvedov, editorinchief of Latvias Russianlanguage newspaper Segodnya, said Xis remarks that all countries involved, regardless of size, are equal partners in a cooperation mechanism, is especially important to Latvia.
