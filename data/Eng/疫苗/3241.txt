A Foreign Ministry spokesperson announced on Wednesday that China will provide  million doses of vaccines to the global vaccine sharing initiative COVAX, at the request of the World Health Organization. This is obviously good news for developing countries, which have to look on without being able to do anything as the developed countries squabble over the distribution of vaccines among themselves. China promised that it would do whatever it could to promote the fair distribution of vaccines and make sure that developing countries could have access to vaccines when it joined COVAX in October .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
