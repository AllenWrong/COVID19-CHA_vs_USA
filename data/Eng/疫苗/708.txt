Strong evidence suggests that SARSCoV originated in horseshoe bats, but whether it passed directly from bats to people or through an intermediate host remains a mystery. PhotoCGTN    LONDON  Though it is known that SARSCoV, the virus responsible for the COVID pandemic, originated from animals, its exact source and intermediate host remain unclear, an article has said. The article published Tuesday on News Medical, an openaccess medical and life science hub, explained how the virus reached humans, based on observations of previous coronavirus outbreaks. Citing research findings by scientists at the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research in Britain and the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou, China, the article shed light on how the virus may have reached humans from animals. Humans are now the dominant SARSCoV host species, it warned, adding that there is therefore a danger of the virus jumping from humans to other animal species, called reverse zoonosis, as is suspected for whitetailed deer in the United States. Humanity must work together beyond country borders to amplify surveillance for coronaviruses at the humananimal interface to minimize the threat of both established and evolving variants evading vaccines and to stop future spillover events, researchers urged in the article.
