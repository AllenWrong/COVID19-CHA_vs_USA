Andre Vltchek dismisses critics of the mainland in HK and overseas, noting that China now has the virus well under control and is working hard to help other countries like Italy combat it                                  The Chinese mainland is closing down the temporary hospitals in Wuhan, releasing patients who are already cured. Doctors are celebrating, and with them, the ordinary people in China and all over the world. It is not the end of the medical emergency yet, but it is the beginning of the end a victory of reason, of determination and discipline a victory of the system that is serving its citizens. People are returning home. Families are being reunited. Cities are slowly beginning to open up again. With the victory comes spring  real and metaphorical.       Now, the biggest threat to China is that which comes from outside, from abroad. But instead of shooting fireworks into night skies, China is sending widebody airplanes. They are taking off toward places such as Italy, bringing medical supplies and medical staff. China knows how to share and how to help those who are in need. It is part of its culture, as it is part of its political system. For several weeks now, the Hong Kong rioters have been relatively quiet. Frankly, they have been humiliated. Lately, they and their handlers have been regrouping, changing tactics, thinking how to harm the Peoples Republic of China, without making fools of themselves again. Months ago, they tried to break China into pieces, using politics. And they failed. Then, they attempted to use COVID, and nothing good came of it, either the PRC flexed its muscles, used some of its best brains, and managed to perform the impossible to save the nation with minimal casualties, in as short a period of time as possible. But what now really is the worst news for the Hong Kong rioters and their decreasing base of supporters? Clearly, the fact that the Chinese and also Cuban socialism have presented themselves as much kinder, much more humane systems than those which are governing the Western countries. The rioters are paid to hate and smear socialism. It is their job, their business to promote Western values. China is now helping others, and so is Cuba, a country which is itself under a malicious US embargo. Cuba has some of the best doctors on earth, always ready to send their medical brigades to all corners of the world, wherever people are facing medical emergencies and calamities. It is said that Cuba may already be extremely close to having a vaccine for COVID. In the meantime, the favorite man of the Hong Kong rioters, the US president, Donald Trump, is trying to turn medicine into a weapon, or as they say, to weaponize the coronavirus. He doesnt seem to have much shame doing it. Various publications, including The Mirror, recently printed stories of analogous headlines Coronavirus Donald Trump offers German lab cash to make vaccine exclusive to the US. Donald Trumps White House offered a German science lab cash to develop a coronavirus vaccine exclusively for the United States, it has been claimed. Is this the system that the rioters want for Hong Kong, for China and the entire world? But this time the world is watching. This time, the world is not willing to forgive. Italian people have been singing Chinas national anthem, from the balconies of Rome, as a thankyou for Chinas help with the coronavirus outbreak. Then, on March , RT reported that the Serbian president doesnt believe in European solidarity anymore, asking China for help instead As President Aleksandar Vucic declared a national emergency on Sunday, he had some scalding remarks for the EU. The crisis has proven that European solidarity only exists on paper, Vucic said, citing the ban on the export of medical equipment and supplies imposed by EU members to nonEU countries in response to the outbreak. Only China can help us in this situation, the Serbian leader added, saying he recently wrote a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping asking him for help and calling him a brother. Now, what do the Hong Kong rioters feel? Are some of them at least finally realizing that they are finding themselves on the wrong side of history? It is not communism and socialism that are outdated and belonging to a depressing pile of historic scrap. It is gloomy imperialist nihilism and fundamentalist capitalism that have, a long time ago, lost all luster and appeal. It took an epic ideological battle over Hong Kong, as well as the global battle against a new form of coronaviruses, to demonstrate where the future of humanity really lies.
