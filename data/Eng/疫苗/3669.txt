Leaving lowerincome countries behind in distribution of vaccines during the pandemic will bring more economic pains for both those countries and the developed economies, according to a research conducted by political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. If rich countries monopolize COVID vaccines, it could cause twice as many deaths as distributing them equally, said a report by Northeastern University. The models of a research found that  percent of deaths could be averted if the vaccine was distributed to all countries proportional to population, while only  percent of deaths would be averted if highincome countries got the vaccines first, said the report.
