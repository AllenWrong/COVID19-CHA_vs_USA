If nothing else, the rising death toll from the novel coronavirus and the warnings of experts that the situation is still grim would seem to be reason enough for the worlds two largest economies to set aside their differences and address the needs of the moment. Heaven knows, it is incumbent on all people to have the common decency to concentrate on countering this threat, for despite some of the worsthit countries seeing an improvement in their situations, not only do they face the risk of their falling COVID fatality rates rebounding, but it is anticipated that some of the most vulnerable countries are yet to face the full shock of the virus. With lives being lost and still at risk, in the United States as well as elsewhere, it is hard for those who do not share the US administrations convictions to fathom why it has chosen to not only snub Beijings calls for cooperationwhich to the rest of the world is a nobrainer, if the virus is to be successfully containedbut also taken the pandemic as an opportunity to intensify its efforts to get the world to decouple from and isolate China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
