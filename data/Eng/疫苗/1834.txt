WASHINGTON  Black people made up more than  percent of the coronavirus cases reported in Washington, D.C. in recent days, compared with  percent late last year, The Washington Post reported on Wednesday.The share of new infections involving Black people spiked sharply in the city starting around midApril, when the coronavirus vaccine became widely available to D.C. residents. The share of cases involving White people, meanwhile, has fallen below  percent, compared with  percent of cases in December.It is yet another way in which the highly contagious virus  which has disproportionately sickened and killed people of color throughout the pandemic  has exacerbated the nations deep racial divides, said the Post. Similar trends have been seen elsewhere in the country, including in both Kentucky and Tennessee.The districts population is about  percent Black and . percent White, according to US Census Bureau estimates. But White residents have been significantly more likely to get vaccinated, due to higher rates of both hesitancy and access issues for Black Washingtonians, it added.D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser noted the disparity on Tuesday, urging people to get vaccinated if they had not already done so Youre putting yourself at risk and youre putting the city at risk, because if this virus kicks up again, among unvaccinated communities, it could drive our numbers up and shut us down, and none of us wants that.The US COVID vaccination program has gone from zero to  percent in less than six months. As of Tuesday afternoon, half of the countrys adults are now fully vaccinated against the coronavirus.
