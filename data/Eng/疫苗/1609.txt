G summit fails to meet the challenges

Agreements on climate, COVID vaccine help for poorer nations described as inadequate         Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, European Council President Charles Michel, US President Joe Biden, Japans Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Italys Prime Minister Mario Draghi, French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Angela Merkel pose for a group photo at the G summit, in Carbis Bay, Britain, June , . PhotoAgencies    When United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson traveled from London to Cornwall to usher in a better, fairer, greener future at the G summit over the weekend, he did so by airplane. The irony of talking about climate change after burning through aviation fuel on a shorthaul domestic flight was not lost on observers on social media. Now that the summit is over, the wellpublicized image of Johnson emerging from a chartered jet at Newquay Airport may be seen as demonstrative of what observers described as a wider hypocrisy that typified the event. At the summit, leaders from the group of wealthy countries called for the global phasing out of both coal power and automobiles that run on fossil fuels, without unanimously committing to their own national deadlines. French climate expert Laurence Tubiana told the BBC that such an agreement amounted to a plan to make a plan. The G nations, several of which sit upon their own giant stockpiles of COVID vaccines, promised more equitable distribution of treatments in the developing world and announced combined donations of  billion doses this year to poorer regions. Former UK prime minister Gordon Brown called the number headline grabbing but woefully inadequate to achieve Johnsons presummit promise of global vaccine coverage by next year. When we needed  billion vaccines, weve only got offered a plan for  billion, Brown told Sky News. I think this summit will also go down as an unforgivable moral failure, when the richest countries are sitting around the table with the power to do something about it. Now that weve discovered the vaccine, we have not delivered the comprehensive plan that will deliver vaccination by the middle of next year. World Health Organization DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that while a commitment to donate vaccines is commendable, it does not amount to much if the actual supply falls short. So far, just  million vaccine doses have been delivered to the developing world by COVAX, the international vaccine campaign coled by the World Health Organization and its partnerswell below the target of  million for the first half of the year. Share doses now, not later in the year, when our need is greatest, Tedros said on Sunday. Max Lawson, head of inequality policy at the charity confederation Oxfam, said that the G summit will live on in infamy and that never in the history of the G has there been a bigger gap between the groups actions and the needs of the world. Faced with the biggest health emergency in a century and a climate catastrophe that is destroying our planet, they have completely failed to meet the challenges of our times, Lawson said. In the face of these challenges the G have chosen to cook the books on vaccines and continue to cook the planet. We dont need to wait for history to judge this summit a colossal failure it is plain for all to see. For Johnson, the summit was a chance for postBrexit global Britain to emerge as a world leader on solutions to mutual global threats. Instead, bitter disputes erupted with his European counterparts over the UKs apparent desire to renege on Northern Ireland trade regulations laid out in the European Union withdrawal agreement. European leaders then denied the White House its wish to unify the G in strategic competition with China on a range of issues. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters We need everyone in the world to work together, especially in the areas of climate protection and biodiversity. We will never achieve solutions there without China. The G leaders did sign on to a USbacked infrastructure investment plan for the developing world. The Build Back Better World, or BW, was presented as an alternative to the Chinaproposed Belt and Road Initiative, which has picked up its pace since its introduction in , with over  countries now formally affiliated. In its statement on the new program, the White House provided no investment figures and few details as to how the plan will be implemented. Martin Jacques, a former senior fellow at the Department of Politics and International Studies at Cambridge University, said he is doubtful of the programs chances for success. The idea that the G could create a serious alternative to Belt and Road is pure fantasy, Jacques said on Twitter. The West is mired in debt. They havent got a clue how to do it. They dont believe in offering this kind of help to developing countries. They have badmouthed Belt and Road ever since .
