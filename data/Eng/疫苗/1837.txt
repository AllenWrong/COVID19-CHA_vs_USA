We support such efforts and will provide active assistance in this regard, Zhu Fenglian, the spokeswoman, said at a news conference when responding to a media query on the progress of the mainlands vaccine assistance to the island.

The Shanghai Medical and Health Development Foundation also expressed its willingness to send vaccines to Taiwan and called on the islands authorities to remove obstacles and provide convenience for the delivery of the vaccine on humanitarian grounds. Shi Qianghua, secretarygeneral of the foundation, said Shanghai and Taiwan have established a profound friendship through longterm exchanges and cooperation. People in Shanghai are concerned about the outbreak on the island and hope that it can soon get over these difficulties. The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said earlier this week that the mainland is willing to arrange the prompt purchase of vaccines and send epidemic prevention and control experts to Taiwan. However, the islands Democratic Progressive Party administration on Tuesday rejected the mainlands offer of help and claimed that it was made in order to mislead the public into blaming the islands authorities for the recent outbreak. Taiwan has had more than  newly confirmed cases a day for  consecutive days. It reported  new cases on Wednesday and  deaths, bringing the death toll to .Experts on the island predicted that the current outbreak would reach its peak by midJune. The outbreak has raised concerns about the availability of vaccines in Taiwan, as the island has been struggling with a shortage, with just  percent of its  million people being vaccinated so far. Many city and county officials in Taiwan and nongovernmental organizations have called for the islands authorities to purchase vaccines from the mainland to cope with the outbreak. About half of Taiwans residents said they are willing to receive globally certified COVID vaccines regardless of their origin, according to a survey released on Tuesday by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation. Zhu, the spokeswoman for the State Councils Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan residents have confidence in the mainlands vaccines. It now depends on whether the islands authorities will accept them. It is imperative to remove the manmade political barriers. Zhu added that the islands authorities have been using different excuses to prevent Taiwan residents from getting vaccines from the mainland, which is the biggest political obstacle for the export of vaccines from the mainland to Taiwan, and also for Taiwan residents to get rid of the epidemic.
