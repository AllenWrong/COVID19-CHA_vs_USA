As I long feared and warned, the effort to distribute and administer the vaccine is not progressing as it should, said Biden, who received his own first dose a little over a week ago in a show of confidence in the vaccine. He added that at the current pace, its going to take years, not months, to vaccinate the American people. The presidentelect has pledged to distribute  million vaccine shots in his first  days in office. This is going to be the greatest operational challenge weve ever faced as a nation, said Biden, who was speaking from Wilmington, Delaware. But were going to get it done. But its going to take a vast new effort thats not yet underway, he said. The current pace of vaccine distribution and inoculation has been slower than what officials have hoped. Data tracked by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that as of Tuesday evening, some . million vaccine doses have been distributed, and only . million Americans have received their first dose. That left officials only two days to reach the yearend target of vaccinating  million Americans. For the two types of vaccines that have got emergency use authorization in the United States, the PfizerBioNTech vaccine requires two doses to be given three weeks apart, while the two doses of Moderna vaccine should come four weeks apart.
