DPP playing games with peoples lives

Following last weeks unexpected spike in new domestic COVID infections, over  of the , since the pandemics outbreak, the island of Taiwan reported more than  and  additional cases on Monday and Tuesday respectively.  An increasing level of community transmission, shown by cases of unknown sources of infection as well as cluster infections, as the local Central Epidemic Command Center outlined, has pressed the islands authorities to impose new social distancing measures, closing bars, clubs and gyms islandwide, while restricting indoor gatherings in some cities.  The situation is worrying not only because either the islands pandemic containment endeavors, which have been widely praised, or its boundary controls arent as effective as thought, or worse, perhaps the virus has found a new way to infiltrate.  It is raising grave concerns particularly because the island suddenly found itself exceedingly vulnerable in the face of the fresh onslaught with less than  percent of the local population inoculated, one of the lowest vaccination rates worldwide.  Even worse, the islands reportedly ,dose stock of vaccines is running out, while there is no word as to when and how many doses the island will be able to receive of the reportedly million on order.  In such a situation, getting all possible resources available to have as many in the local population vaccinated as possible should be the imperative for the authorities. And as everyone knows, across the Straits, on the Chinese mainland, the authorities have not only been providing domestically developed vaccines globally, but they have indicated their readiness to help compatriots in Taiwan.  More likely than not, however, politics will put peoples lives at risk. Both disease control and legislative agencies in Taiwan have openly refused the helping hand extended by the mainland.  It is true that the mainland and Taiwan have a number of thorny political issues to be straightened out. And before that, any rhetoric about goodwill may sound devoid of substance. Most recently, the two sides found themselves in a bitter controversy over whether Taiwan merits an observers seat at the World Health Assembly, which the island once enjoyed and lost after the independenceminded Democratic Progressive Party assumed power.  But this is no normal time. At stake are numerous innocent lives, which should have outweighed any partisan interests.  For too long, people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits have been taken hostage by the antics of the DPP. It is time they stopped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
