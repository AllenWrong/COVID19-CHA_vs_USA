Threat of virulent COVID second waves in G economies
2020-08-25 13:43
Since secondary waves of the virus started far earlier than expected and could be compounded by an adverse mutation, a new threat looms over the worlds largest G economies  policy mistakes and a more virulent COVID strain. In the absence of deceleration, the accumulated confirmed cases worldwide could soar to  million and deaths to . to . million by yearend. If Asian countries fail to bend the curve  that is, slow down the rapid acceleration of new COVID cases  what we have seen in the past halfyear could be a prelude to something worse across the region. Policy mistakes in G compound global pandemic Some countries will face the secondary waves from a position of strength. They are countries that have managed to bend the curve, with decelerating cumulative cases and lower positivity rates the percentage of people who test positive for the virus of those overall who have been tested. Other countries must struggle with the new waves from a position of weakness. They are countries that have failed to bend the curve, with accelerating cumulative cases and higher positivity rates. Collectively, the G economies account for  percent of the gross world product,  percent of world trade, twothirds of the worlds population, and half of the worlds land area. So, what happens to G countries will affect the entire world. The distressing corollary is that when these economies fail to contain an outbreak, the resulting pandemic will also impact the world. In the postwar era, severe outbreaks were typically confined into poorer economies because more prosperous countries relied on sciencebased publichealth policies. The COVID case has been very different. As some of the leading G countries mobilized against the outbreak belatedly and ineffectively, these policy mistakes account for massive human costs and economic damage. Consequently, some of the worlds largest economies are now at risk. To gain a more realistic picture of the associated threats, lets use populationadjusted data and linear scale to focus on those economies where cases are still accelerating and the positivity rate remains high Figure .

While the positivity rates have decreased from peak levels in the US, total cases are approaching  million and deaths , in the US, where testing capacity remains behind that of Russia. In Brazil, testing is at the level of Djibouti. In brief, the real number of cases and deaths are likely significantly higher in both nations. Regionally, the Americas are followed by South Africa, the Middle East including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada, and Western Europe including the UK, Italy, France and Germany. In these countries, the numbers and the positivity rates, respectively, are significantly lower than in the US and Brazil, but they have not been able to avoid earlierthananticipated secondary waves. In India and certain countries in Southeast Asia  the Philippines and Indonesia  where the outbreak arrived somewhat later, positivity rates remain alarmingly high, but numbers remain significantly lower than in most advanced economies. In Japan, the true spread of the virus is underreported because testing capacity remains the same as in Zimbabwe. Japans testing is less than  percent of that in the US and the UK. In contrast, China managed to contain the pandemic within a month or two, which has minimized human costs and economic damage in the mainland. South Koreas early performance was successful but more recently it has been hit by several secondary waves. A new mutation, severe regional consequences Recently, a more infectious COVID strain was found in tested samples in Quezon City and in Malaysia, which has attributed its cases to clusters linked to cases imported from India and the Philippines. This is a development that was projected in my new report, and which requires urgent research and aggressive vigilance. Heres why Not so long ago, a mutation was discovered in the protein that permits SARSCoV to enter cells, possibly making it easier for the virus to spread. The implications are unsettling. The original samples of the novel coronavirus out of Wuhan, China, were a variation that scientists call the D clade. Before March , over  percent of viral samples taken from patients were from D variation. Since March, however, a new G variation has been dominant Figure . Figure  Potential Transition of the Dominant Pandemic Form        Source Korber, Bette et al. . Tracking Changes in SARSCoV Spike. Cell, July  Steinbock, Dan. . The Tragedy of More Missed Opportunities, Aug .    Though not conclusive yet, current evidence suggests there has been a global transition from the D to the G variation. Worse, the latter appears to increase COVID infectivity. Virulent implications If, as the researchers hypothesize, the G variation accelerated in Europe, it benefited from the global transportation hubs migrating across the Atlantic to New York City, which then seeded many of the outbreaks in the rest of the US, including locations where it is now running unchecked  as some investigative journalists also discovered by April. There is a distressing implication associated with the presumed global transition from D to G variation. It could make the pandemic burden of emerging and developing economies more challenging than currently anticipated, particularly after normalization in the US and Europe, when quarantines, lockdowns and travel restrictions are phased out in the West. Due to proximity and regional spillovers from the US, the G variation has been dominant in South America since MarchApril. Perhaps for similar reasons  proximity with Europe  it has also dominated infectivity in Africa. In Asia and Oceania, the lessinfective D was more dominant until recently. However, continued case acceleration and G variation dominance in several countries, coupled with the proliferation of secondary waves could change the status quo  for the worse. Predecents matter Historical precedents are instructive. Between  and , the Spanish flu is estimated to have infected  million people every third person in the world at the time, while the death toll has been estimated at  to  million. Yet, it was the second wave that proved far more deadly than the first. Facilitated by troop movements and logistical hubs during World War I, it spread over to North America, then Central and South America, and eventually to Africa, Russia and Asia. Today, the precedent of the Spanish flu should underscore the importance of proactive vigilance until effective vaccines, therapies or both are widely available. If we still havent learned the lesson of the second wave, we will be forced to learn it over a major crisis  a more protracted pandemic and a multiyear global depression.
