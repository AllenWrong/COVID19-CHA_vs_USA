PhotoAgencies    WASHINGTON  An inactivated COVID vaccine developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical producer Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd. could be effective in stopping COVID, Bloomberg reported. In terms of timing, the company was ahead of most other potential vaccines, including the new models meant to facilitate strong protection and fast production, Bloomberg said in an article titled Chinas Vaccine FrontRunner Aims to Beat Covid the OldFashioned Way published Monday. Though Sinovacs method, which is based on a similar principle to thcentury British scientist Edward Jenners smallpox vaccine, is relatively crude, Bloomberg wrote, it just might work and it could be easier to use than the neverbeforetried approaches of other companies. Weve got to learn about history and not forget whats worked in the past, Michael Kinch, a vaccine specialist at Washington University in St. Louis, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying. Dont get fancy when simple will do it for you just as well, Kinch added. Beijingbased Sinovac, a Nasdaqlisted Chinese biopharmaceutical manufacturer, began finalstage trials in July on its inactivated COVID vaccine, called CoronaVac.
