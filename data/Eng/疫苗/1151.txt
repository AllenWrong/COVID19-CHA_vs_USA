PhotoAgencies    WASHINGTON  As the global vaccination campaign against COVID is getting underway, the competition between rich and poor countries would be lopsided, according to a recent report of US media. Poor countries have vaccinated  percent of their population, compared with  percent in the United States and about  percent globally, the Associated Press reported Sunday. Few expected poor countries to be at the mercy of donations from the rich, or that the inequity would be this bad for so long, it said. That gap is attributed to decisions early on, in the initial bankrolling and vaccine distribution, while US and European officials admitted that they never thought to handle the situation globally. Instead, they jostled for domestic use, said the report. Meanwhile, it also indicated that flaws built into a global purchase plan for poorer countries meant it couldnt compete in the cutthroat competition to buy, as intellectual property rights vied with global public health for priority.
