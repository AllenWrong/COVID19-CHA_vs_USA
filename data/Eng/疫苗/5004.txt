As we stepped into the Year of the Rat, an unexpected epidemic has disrupted peoples daily routine, throwing their work and studies into disarray. The new coronavirus that causes the COVID disease is bearing down on China with tens of thousands of reported infections. The flow of people has facilitated the spread of the virus to other parts of the world. According to news reports, human infections have occurred in many countries, a situation that surely warrants concern. In order to prevent a community outbreak, governments around the world have issued travel warnings against China anyone who has visited China must be placed under quarantine for  days. Thankfully, compassion is never far away wherever an epidemic strikes. The central government headed by President Xi Jinping attaches great importance to the prevention and control of the epidemic. In addition to complete shutdown of neighborhoods and even cities to contain the spread of the COVID scourge, the central authorities also mobilized emergency medical task forces from around the country, including military hospitals, to reinforce isolation and quarantine measures as well as materials and manpower to build two temporary quarantine and treatment hospitals in Wuhan in record time.        Meanwhile, hundreds of medical personnel from other parts of the country, including Peoples Liberation Army hospitals, descended upon Wuhan and surrounding areas in Hubei province to help fight the epidemic. Risking their own safety to save thousands of lives in the epicenter of the COVID outbreak, those medical workers demonstrate the power of a nation united with one heart and one soul in defeating a deadly epidemic. As China is the most populous country and the secondlargest economy in the world, any local incident can have a ripple effect on the rest of the world. In this case, COVID is posing a challenge to public health protection around the world. In an open, transparent and responsible manner, the central government releases uptodate information and statistics on the epidemic to keep all stakeholders informed of the latest developments in the prevention and control of the disease. This is a manifestation of its commitment to protecting public health. In a telephone conversation with President Xi, US President Donald Trump praised China for doing a great job combating the epidemic health experts, including the directorgeneral of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who visited Wuhan before the city was completely shut down, commended the transparency China had shown in sharing disease data and genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, now officially named SARSCoV. Not only did they acknowledge China is making tremendous effort to implement effective measures against the spread of COVID, but also thanked China for helping nations around the world by preventing the spread of the epidemic. Echoing Xis aspiration to pursue a shared future for mankind, many governments have donated medical supplies such as surgical masks, coveralls and disinfectants to the nation in appreciation of the countrys sacrifice for the sake of mankind. In return, Xi promised greater efforts to cooperate with the WHO and the international community in safeguarding regional and global public health. History tells us that panic is the last thing we need in the face of an epidemic. Mankind survived many deadly scourges, such as the plague, Black Death, and typhoid, in the distant past. More recently, we have prevailed over highly infectious diseases like SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, etc., thanks to the concerted efforts of medical scientists around the world. While the battle against COVID continues, it is worth noting that we had been forewarned before the outbreak. For example, Dr Zhong Nanshan, a leading infectious disease expert, said in an interview in  that a public health hazard such as the SARS epidemic in  may happen again. Eleven years later, his fear came true in the shape of COVID, which is particularly serious in East Asia. Even Bill Gates said some years back that a nuclear war may never happen, but an epidemic could occur at any time. He has been proved right more than once, unfortunately. A Chinese proverb says that in time of safety, do not forget danger and always be prepared for emergencies with preventive measures to ensure safety. Hopefully the current epidemic can raise awareness among the international community of the importance of preventing future epidemics. Since the onset of the COVID epidemic, more and more patients have been cured. The number of new infections on the mainland is now falling. At the same time, medical scientists around the world are working diligently on a vaccine to ward off SARSCoV and developing a cure for the disease. Zhong is hopeful that the epidemic can be brought under control, if not stopped, in April so that life can return to normal for everyone. In the meantime, let us pay tribute to all medical specialists and hospital staff who have contributed to our safety and wellbeing in the face of COVID. And our hearts go out to the families of those who lost loved ones while fighting to contain the epidemic.
