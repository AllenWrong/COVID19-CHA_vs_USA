PhotoAgencies    WASHINGTON  US vaccine effectiveness against COVID has declined from  percent to  percent amid the predominance of the highly contagious COVID Delta variant in the country, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC. While we did see a reduction in the protection of the COVID vaccine against the Delta variant, its still twothirds reduction of risk, Ashley Fowlkes, lead author of the study published on Tuesday, told CNN. Vaccines are still very powerful, especially when it comes to more severe outcomes, Fowlkes, an epidemiologist for CDC COVID Emergency Response, told the Atlantaheadquartered television channel on Tuesday. But we are also looking towards continuing to use masks for a little bit longer, the expert noted. The current study does not cover disease severity, however. Instead, the new paper is the latest chapter in an ongoing study that has been following health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers who receive weekly PCR tests in eight locations across six US states.
