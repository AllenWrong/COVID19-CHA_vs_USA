The results came from vitro neutralization studies of sera from eight participants one week after they received the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine. The vaccine produced neutralizing titers against all variants tested, including additional versions of the Beta variant, scientifically named B.. which was first identified in South Africa three lineage variants of B.. which was first identified in India, including the Kappa B... and the Delta variant B... the Eta variant B.. which was first identified in Nigeria and the A.. and A.VOI.V variants first identified in Uganda and Angola, respectively, according to Moderna. These new data are encouraging and reinforce our belief that the Moderna COVID vaccine should remain protective against newly detected variants, said Chief Executive Officer of Moderna Stephane Bancel. These data were submitted as a preprint to bioRxiv, and have not yet been peerreviewed.
