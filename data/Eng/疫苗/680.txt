Even as wealthy countries are considering rolling out vaccine booster shots for their citizens this month, billions of people in the developing world are yet to receive even their first vaccine dose.In the United States and European Union countries, more than half of the population has already been fully vaccinated, while the figure is less than  percent in Africa, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.This vaccine injustice is a shame on all humanity, as World Health Organization DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
