US the country that makes, breaks rules to suit itself

China fully supports the United Nationscentered international order. And its rise has contributed to the evolution of the world order in the direction of fairness, justice and equity.  So when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken repeatedly urged the other members to join the Joe Biden administration in holding Beijing to the international rulesbased order before and at the meeting of G foreign ministers in London on Tuesday, he was telling the world in an unequivocal way who the rule maker is.  In doing so, he was trying to sell his predecessors vinegar as wine. It is the view of the US that Chinas rise will deprive it of its hegemonya mentality whose narrow view is prescribed selfinterest.  Looking at China through the lens to which it has become accustomed, the US fails to appreciate that Chinas view is differentit is more expansive, encompassing all countries in a community of shared interests.  Despite the attempts by the US to portray it as a rulebreaker, China actively fulfills its international responsibilities, upholds the principles of equity, mutual respect and winwin cooperation, and is dedicated to promoting economic globalization, multilateral global governance and resolving differences through dialogue.  Were it not for Chinas longterm socioeconomic developmentbased on hard work at the lower end of the global value chain that has benefited the wealthiest countriesthe deadline for the worlds pursuit of its sustainable development objectives might be delayed far beyond .  Over the past more than four decades, China has contributed to about  percent of the worlds growth, and its success in eliminating abject poverty in the country has accounted for  percent of the global population that has been lifted out of poverty.  That the US and its allies can invade sovereign countries under fabricated excuses without the authorization of the UN Security Council shows the extent to which they can bend the rules for their own benefits. And their unfair monopolizing of COVID vaccines has made it evident how little regard they have for other peoples.  It is ironic that while China seeks to use international meetings to synergize global actions to address common challenges, such as the COVID pandemic and climate change, the G countries, in their first inperson meeting in over two years, have opted to line up as a cohort against China irrespective of the heavy collective costs that will have to be borne.  Instead of working with other countries on the basis of international law, following the principle of equity and justice, and focusing on effective actions to address the common challenge of the pandemic, the Biden administration is trying to push forward a divideandrule strategy in which the developed countries can maintain their privileged position at the expense of the developing countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
