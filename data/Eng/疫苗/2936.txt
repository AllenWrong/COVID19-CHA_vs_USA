As of the end of February, China had provided COVID vaccine related assistance to  countries and two international organizations, as well as exported vaccines to  countries, Guo said. These numbers are also growing. Vaccine is a crucial tool in our effort to prevent, control and ultimately overcome the pandemic, as well as an important subject for international antipandemic cooperation, he said. China has sworn to provide vaccines as a global public good, and encourages Chinese companies to collaborate with other countries when developing and producing vaccines. China has also joined COVAX, a global initiative aimed at promoting equitable access to COVID vaccines. China engaging in international cooperation on COVID vaccines is for helping the global community overcome the pandemic. It is a manifestation of the principles of building a community with a shared future for mankind, he said. Guo said the COVID pandemic is still ravaging many countries. China is willing to work with other nations to tackle and prevail over the pandemic as soon as possible, and contribute more to protecting the lives and health of people around the world.
