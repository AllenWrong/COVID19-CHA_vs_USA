He says joint efforts in virus fight, powerful policies needed to prevent a global recession                    Members of the G should enhance their coordination in macroeconomic policies to prevent a global recession resulting from the novel coronavirus outbreak, President Xi Jinping said on Thursday.Xi made the remark while delivering a speech during the G Extraordinary Leaders Summit on COVID. The summit, in the form of a videoconference, is the first of its kind under the G framework.Noting that novel coronavirus pneumonia is spreading around the world, Xi said the international community should boost its confidence, make joint efforts and enhance international cooperation to strive for victory in mankinds battle against the pandemic.The G countries should implement powerful and effective fiscal and monetary policies, enhance coordination on financial supervision and jointly maintain the stability of the global industrial chain, he said.Xi pledged that China will make greater efforts to supply medicine, daily necessities and disease prevention materials to the global market.In order to make a contribution to stabilizing the global economy, he said, China will continue to carry out a positive fiscal policy and stable monetary policy, promote reform and openingup steadily, ease market access, improve the business environment, increase imports and expand outbound investment.The president called on G members to take joint measures, including reducing tariffs, removing trade barriers and promoting free trade, to send a strong signal to boost the global economy.China, which upholds the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind, would like to share its experience in disease prevention and control with other countries, launch joint research and development of medicines and vaccines, and offer as much assistance as possible to countries that are affected by the disease, Xi said.The virus knows no borders and the epidemic is the common enemy of all, Xi said, adding that the international community should join forces to build a prevention and control network.China has established an online information center on the prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia, and the center is open to all countries, he added.China supports the World Health Organization playing a leading role in setting scientific prevention and control measures and preventing the crossborder spread of the disease, Xi said.G members should enhance the sharing of information on disease prevention and control, promote comprehensive and effective methods for disease prevention and control, and hold highlevel meetings on global public health, he said.Xi said China will remember and cherish the friendship shown when it was in difficulty and some other countries offered sincere help and support.Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China, said the special summit is the most important multilateral event since the outbreak of the disease because the pandemic has led to a global public health crisis unprecedented in the past century.Major economies should coordinate their economic policies, as some countries stimulus policies have caused turbulence in the global financial market, he said, adding that greater communication is needed to prevent the health crisis from turning into a global financial crisis.From a longterm perspective, G members should also discuss how to prevent the outbreak of similar epidemics and improve the global governance system, he added.Koh King Kee, president of the Centre for New Inclusive Asia, a think tank based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, said the G meeting is most timely and is crucial in the global effort to stem the spread of the virus.Moreover, as the major economies of the world are under lockdown, the world economy is in danger of slipping into a depression.World leaders must now act and collaborate, putting aside ideology and geopolitics, take swift, strong and unconventional measures not only to fight the common enemy, COVID, but also to prevent a global recession, he said.He added that China now has the pandemic under control and has rebooted its economy. It has both the experience and expertise to share with the world and the capacity to produce muchneeded medical supplies for countries hard hit by the pandemic.President Xis participation in the G meeting is a must, as China plays a leading role both in ensuring the health of mankind and the world economy, he said.Hirotake Ran, a professor of East Asia studies at Musashino University in Tokyo, said Xis speech at the meeting attracted great attention globally.China was the first country to be hit by the virus and was the most affected one, and it achieved great successes after making great sacrifices. Therefore, the information, experience and lessons offered by China are important for other countries, Ran said.Although the situation and system differ from country to country, it is of great significance to sum up these excellent and effective measures in order to contain the epidemic as soon as possible, Ran added.Contact the writers at anbaijiechinadaily.com.cn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
