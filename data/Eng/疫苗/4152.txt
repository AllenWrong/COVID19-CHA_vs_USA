Health authorities eye equipment stockpiles for safe, swift delivery of COVID vaccinations                     As countries and pharmaceutical companies race to complete vaccines against COVID, UNICEF has started laying the groundwork for the rapid, safe and efficient delivery of vaccinations by buying and prepositioning syringes and other necessary equipment.  The United Nations agency said on Monday it would stockpile  billion syringes worldwide by the end of , to be used for the delivery of any future coronavirus vaccine.  UNICEF, also known as the United Nations Childrens Fund, aims to get  million syringes in its warehouses by the end of this year, to guarantee an initial supply in countries ahead of the vaccine.  Vaccinating the world against COVID will be one of the largest mass undertakings in human history, and we will need to move as quickly as the vaccines can be produced, said UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore in a statement.  The syringes will be used by COVAX, the international coronavirus vaccine procurement, production and distribution pool created by the World Health Organization.  The global initiative, in which China has participated, aims to ensure fair and equitable access to a COVID vaccine once licensed and approved.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHOs directorgeneral, has said, Once we have an effective vaccine, we must also use it effectively, and the best way to do that is by making sure its available to all countries equitably through the COVAX Facility.  COVAX will work to deliver  billion doses by the end of next year. It currently has the largest portfolio of potential vaccines, with several in advanced human trials.  The WHO has identified candidate vaccines at the stage of clinical trials, up from  in midJune, according to Agence FrancePresse.  The health organization said nine candidate vaccines are being evaluated for inclusion in the COVAX Facility. They include two from China, two from the United States, one from the Republic of Korea, one from the United Kingdom and one from a global, multimanufacturer partnership.  Jerome Kim, directorgeneral of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, commended Chinas decision to join COVAX. When Chinese President Xi Jinping said he would make vaccines a global public good, he said the right words. Joining COVAX turns those words into action, Kim was quoted by scientific journal Nature as saying.  China has committed to sharing its vaccines with more than a dozen nations, particularly lowincome countries that it has close ties with.  Expectations are high that a successful Chinese vaccine will soon be available, according to Nature. Heathcare group Sinopharms largescale trials in Argentina, which started last month, have received widespread media coverage, said Eduardo Spitzer, the scientific director of Laboratorio Elea Phoenix in Buenos Aires, which is organizing the trials.  The arrival of a second wave and the realization of the challenges ahead have led to renewed interest in a socalled herd immunity approach.  Worldwide coronavirus cases crossed  million on Monday, according to a Reuters tally. There were an average of about , cases each day over the past week, compared with , in the first week of October. The US, India, and Brazil remain the worst affected countries.  New cases are growing at more than , a day in Europe, as many countries including Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Poland, Ukraine, Cyprus and the Czech Republic have reported record daily increases in the number of coronavirus infections, according to Reuters.  WHO chief Tedros has warned that using the socalled herd immunity principle to stem the COVID pandemic is unethical and not an option countries should pursue to defeat the virus.  Herd immunity, Tedros said, is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached.  But, he explained, it is achieved by protecting people from the virus, not by exposing them to it.  Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak, the WHO chief said, calling it scientifically and ethically problematic.  In an open letter published by The Lancet medical journal,  international researchers called for clear communication about the risks posed by COVID and effective strategies to combat them.  They called herd immunity a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence.  Any pandemic management strategy relying upon immunity from natural infections for COVID is flawed, they said. Uncontrolled transmission in younger people risks significant morbidity and mortality across the whole population.  The authors acknowledged that ongoing restrictions have understandably led to widespread demoralization and diminishing trust among the public. But they insisted that continuing restrictions will probably be required in the short term, to reduce transmission and fix ineffective pandemic response systems, in order to prevent future lockdowns.  The evidence is very clear controlling community spread of COVID is the best way to protect our societies and economies until safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics arrive within the coming months, they said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
