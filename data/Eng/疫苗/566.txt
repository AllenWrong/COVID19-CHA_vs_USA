Speaking during an online event on the pandemic hosted by the Health and Wellness Ministry late last week, BisasorMcKenzie said the Sinopharm vaccine should be among the approximately  million doses of vaccines expected by November. Our supply chain, therefore, is pretty good for the rest of the year, BisasorMcKenzie was quoted by local website Loop News as saying. Members of the Chinese community in Jamaica made calls earlier this year for the Sinopharm vaccine, which has already been administered to citizens in several other Caribbean countries, including Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana, the news website reported. Jamaicans have so far been receiving the AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Johnson  Johnson vaccines.
