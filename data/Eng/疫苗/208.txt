New York City is bracing for a tense week as a controversial COVID vaccine mandate for municipal workers went into effect on Monday, a day before the city votes on who its next mayor will be. Nine in  New York City municipal workers have received at least one COVID vaccine, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said on social media late on Saturday that  percent of city workers had received at least one shot, compared with  percent as of Friday. Under a city mandate, those who had not received at least one vaccine dose would be put on unpaid leave starting from Monday, raising the possibility of shortages of police, fire and emergency medical services workers. New York City has more than , employees. The New York Police Department, which employs approximately , officers and , civilian employees, reported an  percent vaccination rate as of Sunday morning. The Fire Department of New York said on Sunday afternoon that  percent of its employees were vaccinated percent of firefighters,  percent of emergency medical technicians and  percent of civilian employees. More than , city workersincluding police officers and firefighterswere required to stay home on Monday when the mayors vaccine mandate went into effect, according to the New York Post. That includes roughly more than , police, , FDNY employees and nearly , sanitation workers. Staffing shortages forced the department to close  fire companies in all five boroughs on Saturday, the Post reported, adding that one insider said that hundreds of firefighters angered over the mandate were using medical leave to stay home. As of  this morning,  FDNY stations, including five in my district, have closed due to Mayor De Blasios decision to lock unvaccinated firefighters out of work, US Representative Nicole Malliotakis, a Staten Island Republican, said on Saturday, NBC New York reported. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro denied reports that some firehouses had closed. The department has not closed any firehouses, Nigro said in a statement on Sunday. Irresponsible bogus sick leave by some of our members is creating a danger for New Yorkers and their fellow firefighters. They need to return to work or risk the consequences of their actions. Andrew Ansbro, FDNY Firefighters Association president, told WABC Is there a sickout? Not to my knowledge, no. I have had members that have received the vaccination say they are having flulike symptoms, and theyve had to go sick. The department is allowing people to have a couple days off after they get the vaccination. The FDNY confirmed late on Sunday that , firefighters were on medical leave, NBC reported. De Blasio said the Sanitation Department crews will now have hour shifts, as opposed to the usual eight hours, and start working on Sundays to ensure that garbage doesnt pile up. People should be aware and should know that this mayor is putting peoples lives at risk and in danger, FDNY rescue paramedic Niall OShaughnessy said on the Fox Friends Weekend television show. There will be ambulances run down, there will be firehouses that will not be open. We want to serve the people of New York City. We want to respond to these calls.  He is not allowing us to work, OShaughnessy said, adding that after  years, he was considering quitting. The fact that this mayor has put me in this position makes me beyond furious. And not just me, he said. All of the EMTs, paramedics and firemen are furious that this mayor is putting our people, our New York citizens in harms way. The mandates also have become an issue in Tuesdays mayoral election. Democratic mayoral frontrunner Eric Adams has not said whether he would maintain the vaccine mandate if elected. What I dont want to do is add to the tension already in our city, Adams said in a radio interview on Saturday. We have one mayor, and it is his responsibility to bring everyone over this finish line. And I am not going to be disruptive to that process before Election Day. Curtis Sliwa, Adams Republican mayoral opponent, opposes vaccine mandates. A vote for Curtis Sliwa a vote to END vaccine mandates. A vote for Eric Adams  a vote to CONTINUE vaccine mandates, Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels civilian patrol group, wrote on social media on Sunday. Sliwa, , who is considered a heavy underdog in the vastly Democratic city, also has made De Blasio, a twoterm mayor, a campaign issue. In a mayoral debate last week, Sliwa graded De Blasios performance an F, while Adams, , gave him a Bplus. The Police Benevolent Association, the NYPDs largest police union, has made legal challenges to the mandate, which so far have not prevailed. New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said on Friday that thousands of unvaccinated NYPD officers can continue working after filing medical and religious exemption requests. Those who applied for the exemption will be able to work while wearing masks and submitting to weekly testing as their applications for exemptions are reviewed. Hundreds of city workers protested against the mandate on Thursday at a rally, organized by FDNY unions, outside the mayoral residence, Gracie Mansion, in Manhattan. According to the city government website, all the major data on COVID were lower in the past week. The city has reported , confirmed COVID deaths since it began keeping track on Feb ,. Elsewhere in the US, a citywide vaccine mandate will go into effect on Nov  in Los Angeles. People will be required to show proof of vaccination to enter restaurants, bars, coffee shops, breweries, wineries, gyms, spas, nail salons, barbershops, movie theaters and shopping malls, the Los Angeles Daily News reported. In Chicago on Friday, a federal judge rejected an emergency request by firefighters, paramedics and other city workers to halt local and state vaccine mandates, the Chicago Tribune reported. The ruling came shortly after the City Council voted down a proposal from a group of aldermen to repeal the mandate and remove the power over such measures from the mayor. The  plaintiffs named in the federal lawsuit, mostly firefighters and paramedics, had asked US District Judge John Lee for a temporary restraining order that would halt the requirement that all city workers report their vaccination status or risk not being paid. According to an analysis by the Bloomberg Cities Network,  of the  largest US cities are requiring their employees to get vaccinated, with some exceptions for medical or religious reasons. Another  cities are offering employees a choice of getting vaccinated or being regularly tested. In nearly half of the  largest US cities, local politicians are exceeding the guidance set by their state governments, according to Beth Blauer, executive director of the Centers for Civic Impact at Johns Hopkins University. Her article appeared on the Bloomberg Cities Network website, hosted by the university. She wrote that  of the cities are in states such as Arizona, Florida and Texas, where local actions run counter to aggressive state bans against vaccine mandates.
