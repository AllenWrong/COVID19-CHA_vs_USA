Rights talk jars with Wests snubbing of poor, further shown up by Chinese aid                                            Hoarding of COVID vaccines by the United States and some other Western countries has exposed the hypocrisy behind human rights standards they devised to serve their own interests, rights experts said.While the pandemic requires international cooperation on providing vaccines and medical assistance for poor countries, Western states that boast about human rights have not fulfilled their responsibilities, said Essam Shiha, president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights.When the crisis took place, those Western countries cared only about themselves and forgot about the idea of humanitarianism and the idea of sharing, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
