Former district councilors of Hong Kong condemned some Western countries biased comments on the citys National Security Law and criticized them for politicizing global antipandemic work at a United Nations meeting on Thursday.The remarks were made via video speech at the regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The meeting was held in Geneva, Switzerland.During the session, several Western countries criticized China on the issues related to the Hong Kong Special Administration Region.Joephy Chan Wingyan, a former district councilor and an internet celebrity from Hong Kong, in her twominute speech, said that the unsubstantiated accusations are just a kind of same, old political rhetoric.Chan cited an example of a joint statement issued by the G Foreign Ministers last year. The statement alleged that the enactment of the National Security Law in Hong Kong would undermine rights and freedom.But the fact is, people in Hong Kong welcome the forthcoming first anniversary of the National Security Law, as it protects our rights to live normal lives free from blackclad violence, Chan said.It also shows that they are applying double standards as China isnt allowed to safeguard its own national security on its own sovereign territory, while all G countries have their own national security laws, she added.Chan said the recent G summit held in Cornwall, the United Kingdom, is now likely to be remembered as a political theater for a small clique.
