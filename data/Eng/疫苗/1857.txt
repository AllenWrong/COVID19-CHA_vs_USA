The changes are too tremendous to believe, Anna Marie Arnaiz exclaimed.Arnaiz is from the Philippines and is working as an English teacher in the School of Foreign Languages at Minnan Normal University in Zhangzhou, Fujian province.Selected as a representative of Zhangzhou, Arnaiz received the Fujian Friendship Award in , which rewards foreign experts and friendly foreign people for their contributions to reform and openingup and the modernization of Fujian.Having lived in China for  years, she has had a frontrow seat to the historic development of Fujian over the past decade. She has also played her part as a bridge promoting mutual understanding between China and the rest of the world.Arnaiz says that the great strides made in Zhangzhou epitomize the transformation of Fujian from obscure countryside to renowned city, much like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly.I am stunned by the scope and speed of the development, she told China Daily. When I came to Zhangzhou in , all there was were dilapidated buildings, narrow roads, a few recreational areas, inconvenient transportation and limited food choices.But gone are the days when Zhangzhou grappled with backwardness.Take Minnan Normal University as an example. Shabby, old buildings have been renovated, and new ones have been built from scratch, she said, adding that the campus now has a new look.Thanks to the policy of reform and openingup, I am able to enjoy foods from all over the world at restaurants and have far more choice when I go shopping, she said, adding that roads have become wider and more beautiful, and the city now has a sophisticated transportation network, which greatly helps travel and doing business.Thanks to highspeed rail, travel times have been reduced. For example, it only takes about  minutes from Zhangzhou to Xiamen, she said, adding that advanced transportation helps promote connectivity and coordinated development between the two cities.I always marvel at the speed China builds infrastructure. How is this possible at such a breakneck pace?Arnaiz also noted that public infrastructure like newly built parks have attracted more tourists to Zhangzhou and boosted the tourism industry, giving more people the opportunity to open establishments like restaurants and gift shopsWith the new development, Zhangzhou will soon become the next Xiamen, a place where traditional features are linked with modern facilities, she said proudly.The booming economy is delivering tangible benefits to peoples lives, and evergrowing domestic demand has boosted consumption, spurring economic development, she said, adding that more and more of her Chinese friends are able to afford to buy houses.The development of Fujian has not come at the expense of the environment, she told China Daily, adding that Fujian is a livable and ecofriendly place. I know Chinese President Xi Jinping was once governor of Fujian province and attaches great importance to ecological and environmental governance, and his thoughts in this regard are faithfully implemented in Fujian.Arnaiz said she followed the news on Xis inspection tour of Fujian in March, during which he visited a tea plantation on Wuyi Mountain in Nanping. As far as Im concerned, the tea industry cant thrive without favorable environmental conditions, she said, quoting the presidents remarks on lucid waters and lush mountains being invaluable assets.She said that the diligent Chinese people and the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China are the keys to the countrys achievements, and that Chinese people work hard for a better life and maintain a sense of modesty, even if they become wealthy.I was shocked when I encountered a friend who owns two factories eating at a small restaurant, she added, saying that people live frugal lives and are grateful for their current good fortunes.Additionally, Arnaiz appreciates the diligence and responsibility of the people. One of my Chinese friends said that selfimprovement through work also contributed to society, she said, adding that her friends dont sit idle, waiting for government subsidies.When I heard the Communist Party of China for the first time, the first question I had was what the organization was, and whether I could be a member, she said with a smile.Gradually, she learned from personal experience and exchanges with others that the CPC is the backbone of the people and the pioneer of socialism with Chinese characteristics. She hailed the leadership, to which she attributes Chinas massive progress, be it in poverty eradication or the battle against COVID.It is a wonder to me that as the largest developing country in the world with onefifth of the worlds population, China can eliminate absolute poverty. Could any other country in the world realize the kind of achievements China does?How can a country progress if it leaves people behind? The Party and the government are trying to lift everyone up, which I greatly appreciate, she added.Chinas leaders are always thinking about the big picture. They have a vision for the future and keep the peoples interests in mind, she further noted.Mentioning that her homeland, the Philippines, is also a developing country, she said that perhaps the Philippine government could learn from Chinas philosophies and approaches to guide their own development efforts.As the global leader in combating the virus and in achieving positive economic growth, China is a frontrunner in promoting international vaccine cooperation. Having donated or exported COVID vaccines to many countries, China has worked in earnest to improve vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries.Arnaiz rejects accusations that China engages in vaccine diplomacy.China does good to my country by providing vaccines. I believe there are no politics involved, she said.As for those who bad mouth or harbor biases against China, she has a piece of advice Come to China before making a conclusion.I feel blessed to have witnessed the changes and Im excited as to what lies ahead, she said, adding that she would try her best to continue contributing to the benefit of this country, which has welcomed her with all its heart.
