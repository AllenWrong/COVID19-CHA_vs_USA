WASHINGTON  The USs COVID cases surpassed  million on Sunday while public opinions remain sharply divided over the governments response to the pandemic. The number of US confirmed COVID cases rose to ,,, with the national death toll reaching , as of  pm local time, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The hardesthit US state of California reported , cases, followed by Florida with , cases, Texas with , cases and New York with , cases, the data showed. Other states with over , cases included Georgia, Illinois, Arizona and New Jersey. The grim milestone came as White House officials and Democratic lawmakers remained deadlocked over a new relief bill. President Donald Trump signed four actions on Saturday, trying to move around Congress and assert executive power. One of the actions would extend extra unemployment benefits through the end of the year at a reduced level of  US dollars per week, instead of the  dollars approved by Congress in late March, which expired at the end of July. Trump said the reduced level of extra benefits would give people a great incentive to go back to work. The new order also demands that states cover  percent of the dollar weekly benefits. Instead of passing a bill, now President Trump is cutting families unemployment benefits and pushing states further into budget crises, forcing them to make devastating cuts to lifeordeath services, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement.

The countrys actual number of COVID cases may be  to  times higher than reported, according to a recent study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With the virus still spreading, the Trump administration has continued to push schools to reopen in the fall. School reopening is seen as a crucial step to restarting the countrys economy for his reelection campaign. In a Friday opinion piece on The New York Times, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Neel Kashkari and Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, urged policymakers to commit to a more restrictive lockdown, state by state, for up to six weeks to crush the spread of the virus to less than one new case per , people a day, whereas the country currently reports  new cases per , people a day. According to a new ABC NewsIpsos poll of  adults on July , only  percent of Americans said they approved the presidents handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Its no mystery how America got here, the NYT editorial board said in an opinion on Saturday. The Trump administrations response to the pandemic has been disjointed and often contradictory, indifferent to science, suffused with politics and eager to hand off responsibility to state leaders. Among the states, the response has also been wildly uneven, it said. The pandemic has also intensified political and ideological differences in US society. Liberal media argued that the public should stay indoors and children should stay home from school until there is a vaccine. In contrast, conservative media contended that people should take proper safety precautions, but life should go on as usual. Conservatives voiced their belief that leftleaning media put irrational emphasis on the number of cases, which critics said had stirred panic and led to poor government decisions, while liberals said conservative media had not taken the deadly virus seriously enough and this could endanger peoples lives. The divide was even larger between Republicans who described themselves as being conservative and Democrats who described themselves as liberals, according to a report from the Pew Research Center.
