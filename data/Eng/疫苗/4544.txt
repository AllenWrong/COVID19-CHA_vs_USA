She said that cooperation is crucial in the fight against COVID. And in a globalized world, no country can be safe while the virus is still spreading and affecting other countries. Gustava said that from the start of the novel coronavirus outbreak, Africa stood in solidarity with China, and now that COVID is spreading across the African continent, China is assisting Africa through sending medical experts and sanitary supplies. I applaud China for its national unity and its tireless efforts to control the epidemic, as well as its readiness to share information and experience, she said. Africa has so far registered over , coronavirus infections and over , deaths, according to figures from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. And in Mozambique, nearly  people have been infected with the coronavirus. She said that at the Extraordinary ChinaAfrica Summit on Solidarity against COVID held on June , China assured African countries of its continuous support in the fight against COVID, adding that it is a clear demonstration of the willingness and commitment of both sides to deepen cooperation and collectively overcome this common enemy. She also said that the Chinese government, companies and nongovernment institutions have offered help to Mozambique in the past few months, through video exchanges of experience and sanitary supplies such as masks, gloves, thermometers, and ventilators. As Mozambique has not yet reached its peak of infections, the assistance from China will still be needed, she said. We count mostly on our close allies like China to share its experience and material support for testing capacity, medicines, vaccines and hospital facilities, she said. Mozambique will also need Chinas assistance to cope with the economic and financial impact of COVID in all forms, including debt cancellation, suspension and renegotiation of debts, grants or concessional funding and food assistance, she said. Gustava said the consequences of the pandemic had been severe in developing economies like Mozambique, due to its vulnerability to internal and external factors, particularly the reduction in the production of goods and services, falling commodities prices, the collapse of tourism and falling investment, and the impact on small and mediumsized enterprises, which constitute the base of the economy. Gustava said that while this year marks the th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Mozambique, the impact of the virus on the economies of the two countries would affect bilateral economic relations in terms of flow of trade and investment, but she is optimistic considering new windows of opportunity for cooperation between the two countries. China is Mozambiques largest trading partner. In , China was the second largest source of imports and was the fifth largest export market for Mozambique, she said. Bilateral trade Trade between Mozambique and China hit . billion in , an increase of . percent compared with . According to figures from the Chinese General Administration of Customs, exports from Mozambique to China grew by . percent to  million, while imports increased by . percent to . billion. In , China was the secondlargest investor in Mozambique, following the United Arab Emirates. She said that Mozambique has rich and diverse natural resources and abundant labor. And the government of Mozambique is committed to enabling a businessfriendly economic environment to attract foreign investment. Gustava also said she wanted to see more Chinese investment in Mozambique in the future. Separately, she said that Chinas Belt and Road Initiative constitutes an important mechanism for bilateral economic relations since it opens windows for the implementation of crucial infrastructure projects that allow connectivity for business and movement of peoples and goods. Since Mozambique is a gateway to Southern Africa, the BRI will provide infrastructures that give access to landlocked South Africa Development Community countries ports, railways, pipelines, and roads, therefore creating conditions for easy connections between China and Southern Africa as well as for Mozambiques economic development, she said.
