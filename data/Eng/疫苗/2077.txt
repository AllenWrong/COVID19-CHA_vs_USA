Policymakers must wear shoes of those affected
2021-05-05 08:36
A key reason that some businesses succeed and others fail is that the former put themselves in the shoes of their clients and the latter do not. The principle of putting oneself in the shoes of those served also applies to policymaking. The special administrative region government last week announced the arrangements for vaccine bubbles for Hong Kongs eateries, which have been suffering badly from multiple restrictions imposed since the COVID pandemic broke out. Under the proposal, if all staff at a restaurant have received at least one shot of an approved vaccine, eateries can designate a zone for guests willing to use the LeaveHomeSafe app and they will be allowed to dine until midnight with six at a table. Moreover, if all staff have received two vaccine shots and had waited for  days to generate sufficient antibodies, guests will be allowed to eat until  am with eight at a table in a designated zone in the restaurant, provided that they have taken at least one shot and use the LeaveHomeSafe app. Being able to operate until  am and with eightperson tables sounds great. But many restaurant owners have difficulty complying with the proposed rules. Although the pandemic appears to be well under control on the mainland and new cases in Hong Kong have largely been imported cases, some cases with an unknown source are being reported sporadically, and at least one involved a new strain that might be resistant to current vaccines. There is obviously a need to be cautious. But our businesses have made huge sacrifice and their sacrifice appears to have been made in vain because the government did not do its job well. This time it is the governments responsibility to ensure the quality of quarantine as well as the timeliness and quality of tests. Hong Kong has come a long way in containing the pandemic. We have now closed many loopholes that had been left open. During the early days, sadly, while we imposed severe restrictions on business operations in restaurants, bars, party halls, etc., we left significant loopholes in blocking the imported cases. As a result, these sectors sacrificed in vain. We relied almost exclusively on quarantine at home, and we had rejected the idea of quarantining in hotels. We also granted exemptions to many people who work in the transport sector. As a result, we have had altogether four waves of infections. The first wave had peaked at  cases a day on March  and then fell gradually to zero by the end of April . A second wave came, however, and peaked at  on July . Only then did Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siuchee acknowledge that the governments quarantine policy granting exemptions to certain categories of visitors may have been behind the coronavirus surge. The exemption policy was tightened but failed to stop the onset of the third wave of infections, which finally peaked at  on Nov . It was only after the third wave had struck, and starting on Dec , , that the SAR government tightened quarantine and COVID testing rules, and required people arriving in Hong Kong to undergo compulsory quarantine for  days in designated quarantine hotels. So far the latest effort has brought local infection numbers down significantly to zero or low single digit numbers. Anxious that the more infectious and more dangerous strains of the virus could cause havoc in Hong Kong, the SAR government decided to ban flights from India, Pakistan and the Philippines for  days starting April . I would advise that, instead of a complete ban for two weeks, it may be better to schematically reduce the number of inbound flights from highly dangerous places per week so as to ensure that the number of potentially infected visitors can be handled properly. This means that, since India is evidently much more dangerous than the Philippines, the frequency of flights from India should be reduced much more than those from the Philippines. This also means that if our capacity to handle the highrisk visitors has gone up relative to the perceived risks of the country concerned, we can increase the frequency. On the other hand, if our capacity has been pushed to the limit, then the frequency will need to be adjusted downward. Such a measured response is generally better than a ban or no ban decision. At the end of the day ban, would you then allow flights from India to come to Hong Kong bringing hundreds of potentially infected people here? Some of our experts in epidemiology and respiratory diseases have pointed out various potential loopholes that might lead to test samples not properly collected or not properly tested. They have also pointed out how guests being quarantined might contract the virus in the hotels. If quarantine is properly completed and released guests are proved to be virusfree, and if local cases have been kept to zero for  days, we should start opening up our restaurants and other businesses, keeping any remaining restrictions to a minimum.
