Hong Kong is in a long race to solve its housing woes, as calls mount for the construction of public housing units to be stepped up. Gu Mengyan reports from Hong Kong.                                  The scramble by Hong Kong residents to get vaccinated against COVID in order to qualify for a lucky draw with a top prize of a HK million . million luxury apartment highlights the severity of the citys housing problems and the long waiting time for public housing. Hong Kong families, on average, had to wait for . years for a public housing unit in the first quarter of this year  the longest since   according to the Hong Kong Housing Authoritys latest statistics, released in midMay. The financial hubs property tycoons rose to the occasion and offered a host of incentives for vaccinated residents, including lucky draws that could enable them to win a luxury apartment, in response to Hong Kong authorities call to boost the local vaccination rate. The Housing Authority said that only , public housing apartments were built in   a nineyear low. The figure still fell short of the governments estimate in September that , apartments would be completed, indicating that those in the line for public housing may have to wait even longer. I now expect the average waiting period to exceed six years. I also doubt the governments projections for the number of public housing flats to be built in future. It should explain the disparity and try every means to speed up construction, said Wilson Or Chongshing, a lawmaker from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong. Grassroots families on the waiting list are among the hardest hit as many of them have been languishing in subdivided apartments of poor hygiene, he said. The top priority now is to regulate subdivided housing through legislation and subsidize disadvantaged households. The government should also step up building , transitional flats as planned for these families. The government said a draft bill on tenancy control of subdivided units will be discussed at the Legislative Council on Wednesday, and that the government has secured the land to construct the , units more than half of the land was offered by private developers. Special Administrative Region authorities announced a threeyear pilot program on June  that offers cash subsidies to publichousing applicants who have been on the waiting list for three years or above. Up to HK, will be given to eligible applicants who are not living in public housing apartments and are not receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, depending on the size of the family. More than , families are expected to benefit from the program. Ryan Ip Manki, head of land and housing research at Our Hong Kong Foundation, said that besides acute land shortage, complex red tape has hindered the construction of public housing estates, suggesting that a full disclosure of the timeline and progress of housing projects should be made for the public to track and monitor them. He advised authorities to reintroduce a program that would allow private developers to take part in public housing construction and enhance efficiency. Secretary for Development Michael Wong Wailun had earlier said it will now take at least  years  from consultations to construction  to build a public housing estate on undeveloped land, compared with more than  years in the past. According to Our Hong Kong Foundation, construction work for up to  percent of public housing units built between  and  had to be delayed. Over the next four years, , units on average are due to be completed  still nearly  percent short of the governments target. In the latest Long Term Housing Strategy report, the government said it plans to build , public housing apartments over the next decade, with twothirds of them to be completed after . Former Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chunying said in May that Hong Kongs civil servants lack a sense of urgency in dealing with housingrelated projects, alleging it could easily take weeks for a document to be circulated and signed by the necessary departments. We have failed to adopt a do it or die attitude. We really need to race against time to solve Hong Kongs housing problem and we must provide public housing as early as possible for those still living in subdivided flats, said Leung, who is now a vicechairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference, the countrys top political advisory body. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuetngor has acknowledged the deficiency in administrative and regulatory procedures, adding that civil servants are willing to accept criticism. But every administration has its own strategy in terms of land supply, she said. Leung also called for the revival of a plan to develop country parks into public housing estates  an idea proposed near the end of his tenure as chief executive but later shelved by the current administration. He suggested that up to , public housing units could be built on the fringes of Tai Lam Country Park in the northwestern New Territories, covering  hectares, or less than . percent of the total area of the citys country parks. The new homes could be sold at HK, per square foot, he said, adding that authorities should consider developing construction plans and inviting applications from residents simultaneously to expedite the process. We believe the focus of our housing policy should be to find more land in the long run, instead of just changing the use of land, said Lam, adding that turning country parks into housing estates is very likely to spark discontent and opposition among affected neighborhoods. Different housing policies will have different outcomes. You cannot judge the effects simply by speed. The effects of land policies are not immediate in most cases. If you only evaluate the figures at a certain point, the conclusion you come to could be biased, she argued. Leung said, Im not against other plans to increase land supply, but I hope my suggestions wont be ignored. We need to give Hong Kong people, especially young families, the hope of owning a flat. Wong, the development chief, said developing country parks is not an immediate option, noting that the plan had failed to get majority support from the public in . However, the government could reconsider it at an appropriate time, he added. He estimated the government could recover  hectares of land annually in the next five years, compared with  hectares each year from  to . The Development Bureau said in May that three private parcels of land in the New Territories, covering a total of , square meters, would be resumed under the Lands Resumption Ordinance to build , subsidized apartments.
