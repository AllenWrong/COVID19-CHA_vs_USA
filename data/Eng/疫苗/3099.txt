Calling vaccine equity the biggest moral test before the global community, United Nations SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres on Wednesday appealed for key countries and multilateral organizations to spearhead efforts to guarantee equal access to COVID vaccines for all countries. Ten countries have administered  percent of all vaccinations so far, while  have not received a single dose, according to the UN chief. Which is, as he said, wildly uneven and unfair. But it would be substantial underestimation to take it as a mere moral test. Given the extent of the pandemics global impacthaving infected more than  million people and killed at least . million of themthe present hoarding and de facto monopolization of available vaccines will indefinitely prolong the global campaign against the pandemic and result in greater avoidable losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
