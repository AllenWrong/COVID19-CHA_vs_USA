PhotoSipa    MOSCOW  Western claims that Russia and China are waging a hybrid vaccine war or that they are exploiting vaccines as a geopolitical tool are regrettable, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said. Lavrov made the statement Thursday in a joint news conference with Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mukhtar Tleuberdi after their talks, according to Sputnik. This is a reflection of the problems to do with vaccination in the West, including in the EU, he said. We never make critical statements unreasonably, and we never rejoice at their misfortunes, including when it comes to vaccines. While our President spoke about cooperation and the rallying of efforts, Lavrov said, Western politicians see the situation in a different light, judging by their reactions. We are collaborating with those who want this cooperation, who care for the health of their people. These are Kazakhstan, China, India, Belarus and many other countries, he added.
