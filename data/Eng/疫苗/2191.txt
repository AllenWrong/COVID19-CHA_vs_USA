PhotoAgencies    BEIJING  Chinese pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm has commenced phase and phase clinical trials for its new recombinant vaccine against COVID in Central Chinas Henan province since Saturday. Developed by the China National Biotec Group CNBG, a Sinopharms bioscience subsidiary, the vaccine obtained a clinical research permit from the National Medical Products Administration on April . This is CNBGs third COVID vaccine candidate approved for human trials. Researchers started the earlystaged clinical trials in the city of Shangqiu, Henan Province. The trials were randomized, doubleblind and placebocontrolled, according to a company statement. Zhang Yuntao, vice president of the CNBG, said the recombinant vaccine candidate has been genetically engineered. Unlike the companys inactivated COVID vaccines, the new one does not need a highgrade biosafety laboratory for manufacture, and it can quickly achieve largescale production. It is designed for people aged three and above, Zhang said. Whether the gene recombinant vaccine should be administered in three doses will be determined by the results of clinical trials, Zhang added.
