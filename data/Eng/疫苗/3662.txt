PhotoAgencies    NEW DELHI  Indian government Tuesday said COVID vaccines being produced will work against new variants of COVID. There is no evidence that current vaccines will fail to protect against COVID variants reported from UK or South Africa. Most vaccines do target the Spike protein, in which there are changes in the variants but vaccines stimulate our immune system to produce a wide range of protective antibodies, Indian governments principal scientific advisor K Vijay Raghavan said during a press briefing. The changes in the variants are not sufficient to make the vaccines ineffective. Raghavan assured that the vaccines would be effective against COVID including its new variants. Indias federal health minister Harsh Vardhan recently said COVID vaccine may be available in the country during January next year. Development of COVID vaccine is still in progress. At present, there are six COVID vaccine candidates in different clinical trial stages in India.
