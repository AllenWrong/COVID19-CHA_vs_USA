The Party absorbs experience from all over the world to provide more effective governance                                             In , when Koh King Kee organized the firstever seminar on Chinas reform and openingup policy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, he was impressed that the Chinese government officialsall members of the Communist Party of Chinawho spoke at the seminar were open, inquisitive and eager to acquire fresh knowledge. They asked me a lot of questions, including how the outside world saw China and how the country could better develop itself, he said. They were sincere and keen to interact with the outside world and learn from other peoples experience. During the following decades, Koh, president of the Centre for New Inclusive Asia, a think tank in Kuala Lumpur, has frequently been asked similar questions by CPC members and Chinese government officials.
