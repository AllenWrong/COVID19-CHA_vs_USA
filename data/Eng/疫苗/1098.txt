WTO members fail to agree on vaccine rights

Access emerges as principal factor dividing global recovery into two blocs, says report                     World Trade Organization member countries failed to reach a consensus on a temporary waiver of intellectual rights for COVID vaccines at their General Council session in Geneva on Tuesday.  WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said although all members agreed on the need to boost the production of vaccines, they have divergent views on how this can be achieved.  Members will hold an informal meeting in early September to discuss the state of play, followed by a formal meeting on Oct  and .  In , India and South Africa first proposed a temporary patent waiver for COVID vaccines, which could allow local manufacturers to produce the shots. The two countries have argued that this is essential to address inequitable supply.  According to an analysis released on Tuesday by the United Kingdombased advocacy group Global Justice Now, . million people have succumbed to the coronavirus since members of the WTO began considering the patent waiver in October, when the pandemics death toll stood at just over a million. Earlier this month, the global death toll surpassed four million.  Millions have died while the governments of rich countries have been bickering over monopoly rights for COVID vaccines, said Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now.  Every one of those deaths is a mark of shame for the governments of countries like the UK and Germany who have protected patents over human lives.  The virus is ravaging the worlds poorest while rich governments buy booster shots and vaccinate lowrisk groups. Extreme vaccine inequality will be neverending unless we remove the corporate monopolies which are preventing the world from ramping up production, Dearden said.  Britain has thrown more vaccines in the bin than it has donated or exported to date, he added.  Lori Wallach, director of the Global Trade Watch division of US consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, blasted the WTO for preparing to shut down for six weeks of vacation while monopoly protections for pharmaceutical corporations remain an obstacle to scaling up the production of vaccines, tests and treatments needed to beat COVID.  The Delta variant is burning a murderous path through a world where most people are literally dying for a vaccine, but there simply is no supply, Wallach said in a statement on Tuesday.  Until the WTO intellectual property barriers are waived, and governments force technology transfer and fund major new manufacturing capacity so the needed vaccines are made to inoculate the world, it will be one variant after another getting hatched.  The count of COVID vaccine shots administered worldwide topped . billion as of Tuesday, according to Our World In Data, a tracking website affiliated with Oxford University.  Advanced nations have vaccinated nearly  percent of their populations, compared with barely  percent in emerging markets and a tiny fraction in lowincome countries, the International Monetary Fund said in its updated World Economic Outlook released on Tuesday.  Vaccine access has emerged as the principal fault line along which the global recovery splits into two blocs, the report said,  While the global economy is still growing, the uneven distribution of vaccines is widening disparities as rich countries pick up speed and leave developing nations behind, the IMF warned.  Global GDP will expand by  percent this year, unchanged from the April forecast, but IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath flagged the widening gap as advanced economies grow faster and developing nations, especially in Asia, slow.  Around the globe, people and governments are finding out that COVID wont be thrashed into extinction, but is more likely to slowly taper off over a lengthy period. With that will come delayed recoveries in the places that have had the least access to vaccines.  Many lowerincome countries are reliant on COVAX, the program set up last year to equitably distribute vaccines to every corner of the planet. But the initiative has delivered just  million doses of the . billion it aims to ship by early , hurt by delays in supplies from India.  A new World Bank financing mechanism will allow developing countries to purchase COVID vaccines collectively through the COVAX facility, it was announced on Monday.  The new mechanism will allow those countries to buy additional doses using money from the World Bank.  China has donated around  million vaccine doses to at least  countries, according to data published on July  by researchers from the Duke Global Health Innovation Center in Durham, North Carolina.
