Long lines form at hospitals, but supplies quickly run out                                            India is clamoring for oxygen, with the number of COVID cases in the country rising to record levels.Patients at crowded hospitals are waiting for fresh supplies, their anxious relatives forming long lines in areas where oxygen is provided and at makeshift vehicles supplying it.Suresh Kumar, director of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital in New Delhi, said on Sunday The number of people in the lines started to drop when we were down to the last few minutes of our supplies. A tanker carrying oxygen reached us five minutes ago, but it only has two tons of supplies, which will last us another two hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
