Cuomo fears White House could force use without rigorous safety checks                                            New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Thursday his state will conduct its own review of the safety and effectiveness of any COVID vaccines approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, before recommending them to New Yorkers, adding that he fears the White House could strongarm the FDA into using insufficiently rigorous standards to approve vaccines.Cuomo is ordering the secondary review so he can look at the camera and tell New Yorkers that it is safe to take.Im not going to trust the federal governments opinion, and I wouldnt recommend a vaccine to New Yorkers, based on the federal governments opinion, said the Democratic governor, who has often clashed with US President Donald Trump over the pandemic response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
