Plug loopholes in fight against COVID
2021-05-18 00:00
The latest round of coronavirus outbreaks in Liaoning and Anhui provinces has not only raised the alarm over the daunting tasks the country still faces in the fight against COVID, it has also exposed many loopholes in the prevention and control work that must be plugged before they undo all the countrys hardwon achievements. Investigations suggest that the person from Anhui confirmed to have the virus last week visited a clinic in Yingkou, Liaoning, complaining of a fever  days previously. Yet the clinic did not report the case to the local public health authorities as required. As a result, the patient was not properly treated or isolated, and infected many more people including the clinic doctor. Many medical institutions in Luan, Anhui, have been found to have flouted the reporting rules concerning patients with fever. Those found responsible have been punished.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
