The embassy in a message to its citizens in Thailand said the state department could not provide vaccines to the millions of Americans abroad, but would advocate for equitable access locally. The message comes after four US citizens groups last month wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking for Thailand to be made a pilot project for vaccinating Americans abroad, who should have the same rights as at home. US embassies have posted information about local vaccinations on their websites, saying the US government does not provide them. Thailands mass vaccination drive, which includes foreigners, started this month amid its worst coronavirus outbreak so far. So far, about . million people in Thailand have been fully vaccinated. Frances embassy on Wednesday started vaccinating its citizens in Thailand. The need to vaccinate elderly Americans who may be unable to travel home was paramount, Paul Risley, a US citizen and chair of Democrats Abroad, told Reuters. The US government will release seven million vaccine doses to countries in Asia, including Thailand, the embassy said. Reuters
