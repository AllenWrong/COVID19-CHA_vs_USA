Lowdose RNA jab offers cost savings
2021-07-07 00:00
British researchers have developed a new type of RNA vaccine for COVID that requires such a low dosage that one liter of it could produce  million doses. The jab, which was recently found to be safe in humans, uses selfamplifying genetic material, or saRNA, and works in a similar way to the highly effective mRNA COVID vaccine while utilizing far fewer resources. The mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer use  micrograms and  micrograms of genetic material respectively in each dose, whereas Imperial College London scientists believe that the ideal dosage for their saRNA vaccine lies between . and  micrograms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
