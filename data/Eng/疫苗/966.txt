Christmas toy supplies in US under threat
2021-08-09 00:00
Shopping early for toys for children this Christmas may not guarantee they get the gift they want.  Experts in the toy industry say rising retail orders ahead of the holiday shopping season are further disrupting a supply chain already struggling to deal with ocean freight bottlenecks and higher shipping costs.  The supply chain disruption we are dealing with is catastrophic across every consumer category, Steve Pasierb, president and CEO of The Toy Association, said in a statement.  Not only will shoppers undoubtedly and unfairly see price increasesthey may not even be able to find the products they are looking for in the weeks and months ahead.  The COVID crisis halted toy production early last year as countries locked down to reduce the spread of the virus. However, online sales soared as more people switched to internet shopping, leading to a backlog in the global supply chain that has caused shipping delays from China, where the majority of toys sold in the United States are made.  Many companies were swamped with orders fanned by pentup consumer demand, especially as vaccination programs picked up and economies began to recover.  The record volume of cargo is driven by a surge in imports. Consumer spending started increasing in . Lately, it has slowed down by a bit. Still, home exercise equipment, new appliances and other goods are in high demand, Californias Port of Long Beach Executive Director Mario Cordero said on Thursday.  The seaport is one of many around the country dealing with an influx of container ships resulting from high demand. Recently, there were  ships in ports along the West Coast, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California, and  vessels were anchored or waiting for a spot at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.  The whole point is we are trying to move these cargoes as fast as we can, Cordero said, adding that operators of terminals at the Port of Long Beach have extended their gate hours to speed up unloading of cargo.  A spokesperson for the Port of Los Angeles said that the supply chain is disrupted at many points, not just seaports.  Manufacturers are behind on orders. Warehouses are full, along with the railroads and cargo terminals around the world. It is taking longer to get goods to market. That said, many retailers and suppliers have been planning ahead and bringing in goods early for the holiday season, the spokesperson said.  The container ship backlog is just one of the issues causing concern for toy companies and other US businesses. Many of them are also dealing with higher container shipping rates.  Average shipping rates from China to the US have recently scaled fresh highs, well above , per container, according to freighttracking firm Freightos.  On the China to US East Coast route, the price per container has soared  percent from a year ago to , the week before last, the company said.  The surge in shipping rates is the result of disruptions to supply chains as retailers and manufacturers race to restock inventories depleted during the pandemic, experts said.  Hundreds of small and mediumsized companies are still recovering from the pandemic. Their hopes are pinned on a successful holiday season, yet their products might not arrive on time, or at a final cost that makes the effort worthwhile, Pasierb said.  Toy companies are dealing with shipping rate increases of  to  percent and a host of outrageous additional fees, even if they manage to get space on ships, he added.  Until the government implements solutions that address this transportation and logistics nightmare for the greater good of consumers and the economy, it will be an uphill battle for companies struggling to get their products on shelves in time for the holiday shopping season, Pasierb said.  teresaliuchinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
