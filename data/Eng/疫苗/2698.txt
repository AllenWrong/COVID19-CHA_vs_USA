Internetbased healthcare has become a significant part of medical services, bringing smoother and more convenient experiences for the public, said Mao Qunan, head of the commissions planning and information department. He added that  provinciallevel regions have established regulatory mechanisms for online medical services to step up supervision of the burgeoning industry and ensure peoples safety. The essential role of information technologies in the healthcare sector has been amplified by the COVID outbreak, especially the ubiquitous use of digital health codes that have facilitated the safe flow of personnel and resumption of production.

The boom in the online healthcare industry is also spreading to the traditional Chinese medicine sector, said Jia Zhongwu, deputy director of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicines planning department. Many people have assumed that TCM services would lag behind in adopting information technology, which is not true, he said. Jia said that in the past five years about  million yuan . million was invested in building a TCM health information platform linked to over , grassroots TCM clinics and more than , TCM practitioners. The platform aggregates experiences from seasoned TCM doctors, classic cases and some diagnostic tools, he said. Grassroots workers are able to expand their knowledge and obtain suggestions from the online platform, so as to improve the provision of TCM services. Jia said the TCM sector is also confronted by special challenges, including relatively outdated infrastructure and a lack of information technology talent. TCM also emphasizes seeing patients in person to observe their symptoms and appearance, which is very difficult to achieve via remote medical consultations, he said, adding that concerted efforts are underway to address these issues.
