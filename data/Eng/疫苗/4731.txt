With hundreds of residents under medical quarantine, and knowledge about the corresponding tree of contacts still incomplete, it will take time to see the actual scope of the infections. But with Shulan under lockdown and all residential communities in Jilin subject to strict pandemic response measuresonly one person from a family can go out and purchase daily necessities each daythings may get back to normal in a couple of weeks, if no additional infections occur.
