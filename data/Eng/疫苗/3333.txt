Vaccine equity not possible with low supply

Developing countries get left behind as richer nations begin COVID inoculation drives                     Uneven distribution of COVID vaccines, as well as economic and political factors, appears to be delaying a swift resolution to the pandemic.  Health experts have said that the worldwide pandemic will be controlled the fastest if safe and effective vaccines are deployed in the most efficient way possible, with the first doses going to groups at the highest risk, such as medical workers, nursing home employees and the elderlyrather than to whole populations in rich countries.  At the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on Wednesday, World Health Organizations DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stressed the importance of the vaccine distribution to all countries. Vaccine equity is not just a moral imperative. Ending this pandemic depends upon it, he said.  Countries around the world have started their national vaccination campaigns. According to digital media outlet Morocco World News, the global race for COVID vaccines could leave poor, lowincome countries out of the picture.  While wealthy nations such as Israel and the United Arab Emirates are leading the world with their rapid vaccination drives, poorer countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Yemen have yet to receive a single dose of COVID vaccines.  The WHO, which has rolled out the COVAX program aiming to distribute COVID vaccines to countries that are unable to compete in the global scramble for vaccine doses, wants to make the distribution fair and equitable.  Some countries and companies are making bilateral deals, going around COVAX, driving up prices and attempting to jump to the front of the queue, Tedros said.  He said that it is not right that younger, healthier adults in rich countries are vaccinated before health workers and older people in poorer countries.  Based on a report by the Washington Post, the West African nation of Guinea is the only lowincome country of  to begin vaccinating while more than  countries, most of them wealthy, have their coronavirus vaccination efforts well underway.  As some developing countries await vaccine deliveries under the COVAX program beginning February, China is seeing its affordable vaccines being granted market approval or emergency use in countries such as Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. With the country being a part of the COVAX initiative, a WHO team in China has been working with the producers of the Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines for potential emergency use listings.  Yin Weidong, Sinovac chairman and CEO, told Xinhua in an interview that his company has a large number of overseas orders and it is ramping up production while meeting safety and quality standards required of drug regulatory bodies.  Vaccines are public goods and we should shoulder social responsibilities, Yin said.  Delivery failure  Despite many leaders calling for the limited global vaccine supply to be fairly distributed, Europe is still preoccupied with its own disputes regarding vaccine orders.  Europes fight to secure COVID vaccine supplies escalated on Thursday when Britain demanded that it should receive all the shots it paid for after the European Union asked AstraZeneca to divert supplies from the United Kingdom. The EU is far behind Israel, the United States and the UK in rolling out vaccines, and is scrambling to get supplies just as drugmakers have warned about slow deliveries to the bloc due to production problems.  European leaders have also publicly admonished vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and AstraZeneca for failing to deliver on their delivery commitments.  In an unusual move, the French pharmaceutical group Sanofi SAN said on Wednesday that it will give Germany based BioNTech access to a production facility in Frankfurt to produce more than  million doses of its vaccine in Europe, which will start to be delivered this summer.  We are very conscious that the earlier vaccine doses are available, the more lives can potentially be saved, said Paul Hudson, chief executive of Sanofi SNY, in a statement.  Although vaccination campaigns have started around the world, the ability to get shots into arms is being limited by lower than expected supplies and delayed approval timelines owing to production shortages, he said. We have made the decision to support BioNTech UA and Pfizer QN, in manufacturing their COVID vaccines in order to help address global needs, given that we have the technology and facilities to do so.  BioNTech and Pfizer have said they can produce  billion doses this year, but demand has outstripped supply as mass immunization campaigns have started in countries worldwide, including the UK, the US and Europe.  Earlier this month, the two companies said they needed to temporarily cut supplies to the EU in order to increase production in the future. AstraZeneca, which developed its vaccine with the University of Oxford, warned on Friday that it would not be able to fulfill its contractual obligations with the bloc and deliver the  million doses promised by the end of March, due to problems at a manufacturing site.  The delays prompted the EU, which has ordered  million doses of the PfizerBioNTech shot, to say that it might restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
