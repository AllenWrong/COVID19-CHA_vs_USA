PhotoAgencies    CANBERRA  Australias top union boss has called for the federal government to fund paid leave for workers who get coronavirus vaccines. Sally McManus, the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions ACTU, on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Scott Morrison advocating for up to four days vaccination leave for all workers in the aged and disability care sectors. She said about  percent of vaccine recipients had experienced side effects, and the twoday for each dose would support workers as they recover. The absence of paid leave is likely to impact the rate of vaccination uptake across these sectors, McManus said. Unlike those in the broader health sector, these workers do not have access to industrial entitlements that would support their participation in the vaccination program, such as paid leave and paid travel time. Aged and disability care workers have been eligible to get inoculated against COVID since late February under phase a of the rollout, while McManus said less than  percent of the workforce has done so and called on the government to introduce workplace vaccinations. This is inconsistent with the approach taken to providing vaccinations to other healthcare workers and highpriority groups as outlined in the federal governments COVID vaccine rollout strategy, she said. To achieve the high rates of vaccination needed to ensure community protection, it is critical that workplace vaccination is readily available. As of Friday there has been . million vaccine doses administered in Australia.
