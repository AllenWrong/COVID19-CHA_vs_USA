International society should uphold the real multilateralism to better deal with the complex and changing global situation amid the pandemic, an international studies expert said.Under the guise of practicing multilateralism, some countries formed alliances targeting certain countries. This practice poses risks to the international community, said Ruan Zongze, executive vicepresident of the China Institute of International Studies.Real multilateralism means that everyone needs to handle issues together through consultation, which is in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, instead of letting a few countries make decisions for others, or forcing others to follow their ideas, he said.The unfair distribution of COVID vaccines, where certain developed countries cornered excess amounts while developing countries have no access to the doses, has shown that such developed countries are pressuring others with their power, Ruan said.China, on the other hand, has advocated the establishment of a community with a shared future for health since the beginning of the pandemic, and is devoted to the fair distribution of vaccines.In such circumstances, I think Chinas behavior reflects the fact that the country resolutely safeguards multilateralism, Ruan said during a discussion in Beijing on Wednesday with reporters from home and abroad on the current international situation.No country can defeat any global public crisis and survive by itself no matter how powerful it is, and there is an urgent need for winwin cooperation, Ruan said during the discussion organized by the AllChina Journalists Association.Speaking on China imposing sanctions on  individuals and four entities in the European Union, Ruan said the measures are a selfdefense counterattack against the EUs interference in Chinas internal affairs. China sanctioned the individuals and entities for severely harming Chinas sovereignty and interests and maliciously spreading lies and disinformationChina will never tolerate such a situation, he said.However, Ruan said he believes the twists would not fundamentally affect the ChinaEU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment as the treaty is beneficial to both sides.If there is any impact, it means that a small number of antiChina forces have kidnapped the relationship between the EU and China, and the EU will lose a huge opportunity and market, he said. It will not benefit the EUs longterm development.
