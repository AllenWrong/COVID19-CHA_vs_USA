General secretary charts course on new journey
2021-11-08 00:00
Throughout , a special year in Chinas history, the schedule of Xi Jinping has been busy. Over the past months, he addressed a ceremony marking the Partys centenary, announced the realization of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, inspected Tibet, talked to astronauts working at Chinas first space station, attended online meetings of the United Nations and had phone or video talks with world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and United States President Joe Biden. This week, Xi, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, will attend a highprofile Party plenumthe sixth plenary session of the th CPC Central Committee. A landmark documentthe resolution on the major achievements and historical experience of the CPCs  years of endeavorswill be introduced at this important meeting. Few political parties worldwide could boast such a long history and uninterrupted period of State governance. The CPC has been Chinas ruling party for  years. Currently, Xi is the core of the CPC leadership. Before him, generations of central collective leadership had spanned the decades with Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao as chief representatives. Since being elected general secretary of the CPC Central Committee in November , Xi has been seen as a man of determination and action, a man of profound thoughts and feelings, a man who inherited a legacy but dares to innovate, and a man who has forwardlooking vision and is committed to working tirelessly. Under his leadership, China is becoming a powerful country and is now entering an era of strength, according to Channel News Asia. On the new journey, Xi is undoubtedly the core figure in charting the course of history. How will he lead the Party in the face of opportunities and challenges? How will he bring China back to the worlds center stage? Today, the world is watching Xi just as closely as nine years ago. Walking with the people In September, during an inspection of the village of Gaoxigou in northwestern Shaanxi province, Xi stopped by farmlands to check the crops and chat with villagers working in the fields. Xi hailed the achievements of local poverty alleviation. Gaoxigou was once an impoverished village today it is prosperous thanks to the relentless efforts of cadres and villagers. It was in  in Shaanxis Liangjiahe, about  kilometers from Gaoxigou, that Xi joined the Party. He was just  years old when he arrived in Liangjiahe in  as an educated youth. He would spend the next seven years living in the small village on the rural Loess Plateau at the end of a days labor, he would return to his primitive cave house and sleep on a simple clay bed. It would take  years and multiple postings across various levels of the Partys hierarchy until he would be elevated to the top job. After joining the CPC, Xi became Party secretary of Liangjiahe. Shedding light on his caliber, one of his village colleagues said Xi worked conscientiously, had many ideas and could unite the people and cadres. Recalling his time in the impoverished village, Xi said what he wanted more than anything was to make it possible for the villagers to have meat on their plates. To improve the lives of those who called the community home, Xi initiated various projects, including wells, terraced fields and methanegenerating pits. These simple projects would have a significant impact on the villagers lives, work and attitudes. In his spare time, the young Xi devoured as many books as he could. In particular, he read Das Kapital three times his reflections on the seminal work filled  notebooks. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was among the first generation of CPC central leaders. Xi Jinping often evoked the wisdom imparted to him by the elder Xi. Inspired by a muchloved schoolbook, he decided he would carry on the revolutionary torch from a young age. In , Xi was admitted to the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing. After graduating, he first worked at the general office of the Central Military Commission before moving to Zhengding, a county in northern Hebei province, in . Recalling the move to Zhengding, Xi said he had volunteered to work at the grassroots level among the people. He said he wanted to love the people like he loves his parents. After Zhengding, Xis political career took him to the coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang and the metropolis of Shanghai. Wherever he went, his close ties with the people were notable. He wrote heartfelt essays commemorating his deceased friends and colleagues in Zhengding. He used his own money to help finance the medical treatment of a villager from Liangjiahe. Xis care for the people can be seen in every aspect of his work. Zhang Hongming, one of his colleagues back in Zhejiang, still remembers Xis attitude and work ethic when the province was hit by typhoons. Even if nine of our  evacuations are for nothing, we still need to do it to ensure the absolute safety of the people, Zhang said, recalling Xis instructions. Xis peoplecentered philosophy explains why he ordered unwavering efforts to save peoples lives at all costs during the COVID epidemic, said Liu Jingbei, a professor at the China Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong, Shanghai. In , Xi returned to Beijing to sit on the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and later became Chinas vicepresident. He oversaw areas including Party building, organizational work, Hong Kong and Macao affairs and preparations for the  Beijing Olympics. At the age of , Xi was elevated to the Partys most senior post in November . About a month later, he braved the winter cold to visit poor villagers in Hebei. Sitting down with them, Xi asked about their income, and if they had sufficient food and enough quilts and coal to stay warm through the winter. Xi said his heart sank when he saw that some villagers were still struggling to make ends meet. The year  is also the ninth year of Xis signature anticorruption campaign, the most extensive in Chinese history. It shows no signs of letting up. More than  highlevel officials and executives in the financial sector have been punished or investigated this year. And in the past  days or so, one former ministeriallevel official in the central governments lawenforcement apparatus was investigated while another was punished. When Xi was elected general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, China was already the worlds secondlargest economy. Yet, it faced challenges from within. Facts prove that if corruption is allowed to spread, it will eventually lead to the destruction of a party and the fall of a government, Xi said in a stern warning. Strengthening the Party Over the past nine years, more than  officials at ministerial level or above have been punished or investigated, including a former member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and two former vicechairmen of the Central Military Commission. From  to , over , fugitives were repatriated from more than  countries and regions. In a critical time, Xi turned the tide, said a foreign media editorial. Xi has ordered efforts to lock power in the cage of systemic checks. He also spearheaded the establishment of the National Supervisory Commission. All public sector employees came under supervision following the supervisory reform. As general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Xi has led efforts to formulate and revise around  intraParty regulations. He also launched five Partywide education campaigns to firm up the ideals and convictions of Party members and ensure they act effectively and in unison. Xi also attaches great importance to intraParty democracy. Solicited comments from CPC members are now incorporated into all Party national congress reports, documents reviewed at plenary sessions, and major Party documents, decisions, and reform policies. By June this year, the number of CPC members had grown to  million,  million more than the population of Germany. Experts in China affairs say the Party has become more disciplined, pure and powerful. Xi Jinping is now enjoying greater support within the CPC than ever, said Neil Thomas, a China observer. In , the sixth plenary session of the th CPC Central Committee established Xis status as the core of the CPC Central Committee and the whole Party. Without a strong leadership core, the CPC would find it hard to unify the entire Partys will or build solidarity and unity among people of all ethnic groups. It would not be able to achieve anything or carry out any of its great struggles with many new historical features, said Wang Junwei, a research fellow at the Institute of Party History and Literature of the CPC Central Committee. In October , Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era was officially instituted at the th CPC National Congress. The thought was enshrined in the CPC Constitution and Chinas Constitution. Like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, Xi has advanced the adaptation of Marxism to the Chinese context and kept it relevant, said Xin Ming, a professor at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, or the National Academy of Governance. Making China strong After the Opium War of , China was gradually reduced to a semicolonial and semifeudal society. It was bullied by foreign powers and suffered from poverty and weakness. What a humiliation! China was trampled upon at that time, Xi said in reference to that part of history. The CPC was founded in  to change the situation. According to Han Qingxiang, a professor at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, the pursuit of national rejuvenation is marked by four critical milestonesthe Partys founding in  the founding of the Peoples Republic of China in  the advent of reform and openingup in  and the new era after the th CPC National Congress in . Two weeks after Xis election as general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, he put forward the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. This October, at an event commemorating the th anniversary of the Revolution of , Xi mentioned rejuvenation  times in his minute speech, making it one of the most emphasized messages. Xi believes that rejuvenation requires both strategic design and hard work. He took the lead by being a man of action. In  alone, he took part in more than  important events. His working itinerary covered weekends of about  weeks in that year. He revised each draft of major reform plans. Although Xi has little time for himself, he manages to find time for swimming. This and physical labor during his youth ensure that he has enough stamina to deal with affairs of the Party, government and the military. More importantly, he is driven by a sense of mission. Happiness is achieved through hard work, he said. Xi often visits farms, fishing villages, farmers houses, small eateries, supermarkets, factory workshops, laboratories, hospitals and schools, and even inspects pigsties and toilets to obtain firsthand information of peoples livelihood. Zhang Mengjin, a former colleague of Xis in Zhejiang province, said Xi takes in enough knowledge day to day so it is impossible to fool him with lies or bragging. We have to be honest when reporting to him. Xi has stood the test in the face of numerous hurdles and crises over the past nine years. In early , when Yemen descended into chaos, he directed the Navy to evacuate hundreds of stranded Chinese nationals. When the US initiated a trade war against China, he devised the strategy that China does not want a trade war but is not afraid of one and will fight one if necessary. He also said strengthening dialogue and cooperation is the only right choice for the two countries. The vast Pacific Ocean has enough space for the two large countries of China and the United States, Xi said. From conducting regular patrols in the waters of the Diaoyu Islands, fending off the socalled South China Sea arbitration, finding solutions to ChinaIndia border conflicts, to facilitating the return of Chinese people illegally detained overseas, Xi has spearheaded strategic and tactical planning and, if necessary, personally intervened. In , when social unrest gripped Hong Kong, he directed efforts to safeguard the one country, two systems cause and crush attempts to instigate a color revolution. On the eve of Lunar New Year , with the COVID epidemic clouding festivities, Xi had a sleepless night. The next day, he convened a Party leadership meeting to discuss the countrys response. Before the meeting, Xi had made a decision to tighten restrictions on the movement of people and channels of exit in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan. Time has shown how this strict approach was the only viable option. Xi introduced black swan and gray rhino into Party parlance. Han, the Party school professor, identified risk prevention and defusing as a major highlight of the new era. It is indeed a huge responsibility and arduous task to govern such a big country, Xi said when answering a question from a foreign politician. I am willing to be selfless and devote myself to Chinas development. I will not let the people down. Breaking new ground When Xi took office as general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Chinas strength had significantly risen after more than  years of reform and openingup. Yet, it was not without problems, including downward pressure on the economy, wealth disparities, environmental damage and social tension. Reforms also encountered some resistance. A more scientific toplevel approach was needed. Xi designed a Chinese model of modernization characterized by an innovative, coordinated, green and open development path that is for everyone. Observers say this development vision is intended to lead socialist China out of a development trap reliant on extensive and inefficient growth at the cost of ecological damage, shifting the country to highquality development and avoiding situations where the rich become richer and the poor poorer. As head of the central commission for deepening overall reform, formerly a central leading group, Xi launched a series of reforms that broke new ground while furthering Deng Xiaopings reform and openingup. Reform has reached into diverse fields, spanning landuse policies, Party building in Stateowned enterprises, judicial procedure, family planning, fiscal and tax policies, the real estate market, science and technology and antimonopoly efforts. One reform measure, above all, stands out the modernization of institutions, which directly affects Chinas longterm development and stability. Its essence is upholding and improving socialism with Chinese characteristics, and modernizing Chinas system and capacity for governance. At times, reforms encountered great difficulties. To address controversies and eliminate obstructions, Xi himself had to give the final say. Xi headed a group tasked with drafting the document of the third plenary session of the th CPC Central Committee. The document centered on deepening overall reform. Officials and experts who participated in the drafting and appraisals said Xi personally conducted research and made decisions, facilitating many breakthroughs. For example, the new proposition let the market play the decisive role in resource allocation resulted from Xis vital decision. Without General Secretary Xis determination, it would not have been possible to roll out many major reforms, said a source familiar with the process. To reverse environmental damage, Xi demanded that polluting factories address problems or face closure. He issued a year ban on fishing to protect Chinas longest river, the Yangtze. He gave six instructions to demolish illegally constructed villas in the Qinling Mountains, home to giant pandas, snubnosed monkeys and many other rare wild animals. For many Chinese people, environmental improvements are obvious. In , the percentage of days with good air quality was  percent in cities at and above the prefecture level. The proportion of surface water with fairly good quality rose to . percent. As a result, . percent of Chinese people were satisfied with the environment. Reforms have made China more open. In , the first pilot free trade zone was established in Shanghai. Now the number of such zones has reached , including the entire island of Hainan, which is roughly the size of a small European country. Chinas negative list for foreign investment has been further shortened. While some countries chose to erect trade barriers, China made itself host of a series of global trade and investment fairs. Xi personally initiated the China International Import Expo, one of the multiple nationallevel expos across the country. China also took the lead in ratifying the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. By the end of , China had rolled out , reform plans in over seven years. The targets and missions set at the third plenary session of the th CPC Central Committee had been essentially accomplished as scheduled, Xi announced. From  to , Chinas GDP grew by about . percent each year on average, contributing more than  percent of world economic growth on average for many years in a row. Chinas GDP exceeded the trillionyuan . trillion threshold in , or about seventenths of that of the US. In , China ranked th in the Global Innovation Index, higher than Japan, Israel and Canada. It is the top recipient of foreign direct investment and the worlds No  consumer market. So far, the most impressive achievement in the new era has been the accomplishment of the first centenary goal, namely building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, said Liu Ronggang, another research fellow at the Institute of Party History and Literature of the CPC Central Committee. The term moderately prosperous, or xiaokang in Chinese, originates from the Book of Songs of ancient China. It is an aspiration for a welloff life cherished by the Chinese people for thousands of years. The country has the worlds most extensive social security system in scale and the largest middleincome group. Extreme poverty has ended, once and for all. Over the past nine years, about  million people have been hoisted out of extreme poverty. Xi ordered Party members and officials to be stationed at impoverished villages to carry out targeted poverty alleviation measures at the front line. Xi himself had visited every one of the countrys  contiguous poorest areas. Eliminating extreme poverty was likened to fighting a war. Indeed, the campaign had its fallen heroes, with more than , people dying in the line of duty. Xi also comprehensively reformed the armed forces. Reiterating the principle established by Mao Zedong that the Party commands the gun, Xi introduced a series of reforms in the militarys leadership and command system, size, structure and force composition. He demanded the military be combatready. He regularly inspected military bases. He boarded Chinas first domestically built aircraft carrier and newgeneration nuclearpowered submarine. Gerd Kaminski, an Austrian legal scholar and Sinologist, said that after the th National Congress of the CPC, Chinese characteristics became an increasingly central guiding principle in all significant issues of Chinas development, including its governing philosophy. In such a process, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era has stood the test, said Han Qingxiang. It effectively leads the historical course of national rejuvenation and influences the whole world. Contributing to world Xi has been at the forefront of Chinas efforts to engage with and contribute to the global community. Before the COVID pandemic broke out, he had visited  countries in  tours and been the first Chinese head of state to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos. He has said that, while spending so much time on overseas visits might be deemed a luxury, he sees it as worthwhile. His schedule during overseas visits is usually very tight and can last until the small hours. Not even his birthday stopped him from making an overseas tour. Everything we Chinese Communists do is to better the lives of the Chinese people, renew the Chinese nation, and promote peace and development for humanity, Xi said. Altay Atli, a scholar based in Istanbul, Turkey, noted that there is a transformation of Chinas participation in international affairs, whether economic or diplomatic, under Xis leadership, and that the world is witnessing the emergence of a major country with global influence. The world is too big, with too many challenges, to go without the voice from China being heard, without solution ideas from China being shared, without the involvement of China being needed, Xi said. In , Xi raised the notion of building a community with a shared future for humanity. When elaborating on the specifics of his vision, Xi proposed that the international community should promote partnership, security, growth, intercivilization exchanges, and the building of a sound ecosystem, citing a proverb The interests to be considered should be the interests of all. A community with a shared future for humanity comes from an excellent pedigree. Political scientists have noted that the notion inherits the Marxist idea of an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all, and the Chinese ideal of harmony. It is the most recent proposition on foreign affairs floated by the CPC, following Mao Zedongs Three Worlds Theory and Deng Xiaopings peace and development as two main world themes. The response from the international community has been positive. When Xi presented his vision at the Palace of Nations, the United Nations Office at Geneva, in January , politicians, diplomats and celebrities across the world responded with more than  waves of applause in  minutes. Under this concept, Xi proposed a new approach to international relations based on mutually beneficial cooperation and the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration in global governance. What kind of international order and governance system best suits the world and best suits the people of all countries? This is something that should be decided by all countries through consultation, and not by a single country or a few countries, he said. The same principle runs through the framework for majorcountry relations, as advocated by Xi, which features overall stability and balanced development. On many occasions, he has stressed that if nations maintain communication and treat each other with sincerity, the Thucydides trap can be avoided. By ,  countries had diplomatic relations with China, a sharp increase from around  in the s. Over the past few years, five countries in Central America and the Pacific region established or resumed diplomatic ties with China. We have friends in every corner of the world, Xi said. When meeting with outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel via video link in October, Xi called her an old friend The Chinese people put a premium on friendship we will not forget old friends and will always keep the door open for you. The same year that Xi first called on the world to jointly build a community with a shared future for humanity, he also proposed the Belt and Road Initiative. By August , about  countries and international organizations had signed more than  cooperation documents with China under this framework. According to a report from the World Bank, BRI projects could help lift . million people out of extreme poverty and  million people out of moderate poverty globally. Xi has personally visited several BRI projects, including the Port of Piraeus in Greece, the Smederevo steel plant in Serbia, and the ChinaBelarus Industrial Park in Minsk, Belarus. Global development, however, should not come at the cost of the environment, and in  Xi offered a clear signal of commitment when he told the world that China would peak carbon dioxide emissions before  and achieve carbon neutrality before . The world should thank China for its contribution to climate change responses, said former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Xi offered Chinas strong support for the Paris Agreement four years ago and, without Chinas support, the agreement would not be the way it is now, Rudd added. Xis commitment to offering a helping hand transcends environmental and development issues. Today, China is a vital force in addressing global and regional flashpoint issues, ranging from nuclear proliferation to pandemic response. We need to join hands with each other instead of letting go. We need to tear down walls, not to erect walls, he said. A few months ago, when the abrupt withdrawal of US troops triggered unrest in Afghanistan, Xi had a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and met with leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization members via video link to call for supporting the steady transition of Afghanistan, engaging the country in dialogue and helping the Afghan people. When COVID broke out, Xi called for global solidarity and cooperation. By his instruction, China provided antivirus material for more than  countries and  international organizations and sent  medical teams to  countries. He pledged to make Chinese COVID vaccines a global public good and promised that China would provide  billion doses of vaccines to the world this year. The country also promised to donate  million to COVAX. Over the past  years, the worlds most populous country has been on an almost unbelievable journeyfrom a povertystricken nation to one where basic needs are met to its current state of moderate prosperity. Xi deemed this achievement a contribution to humanity. More than  percent of worldwide poverty reduction over the last  years was in and by China, which means it realized its poverty reduction goal from the UN  Agenda for Sustainable Development  years ahead of schedule. Describing her impressions of Xi, Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces, president of the rd session of the UN General Assembly, called him a seasoned captain whose contributions, such as advocating multilateralism, the BRI, and the notion of a community with a shared future for humanity, have been significant. Fulfilling new missions The CPC plans to achieve national rejuvenation through a pair of goals, known as two centenaries. During the past nine years, as the Partys most senior leader, Xi has led the country in completing the first step and chaired the design of the second step of this historic plan. First, socialist modernization should be basically realized by , and second, China should be built into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful by the middle of the st century, which will be around the centenary of the PRC. Supplementary road maps support these overarching goals. Most notably, Xi spearheaded the drafting of the Party leaderships proposals for the th FiveYear Plan  and the LongRange Objectives Through the Year , which were adopted in October . Xi has described the CPCs past century as a historic miracle and expressed confidence that the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is dawning. However, he also warned that this is no time for indecision. At this critical moment, we must not stop, hesitate or wait, Xi said. He warned that achieving national rejuvenation will be no walk in the park, and the coming tests will only become more complex. Realizing this great dream demands a great struggle, he said. Therefore, the upcoming sixth plenary session of the th CPC Central Committee comes at a significant time, as a resolution on the major achievements and historical experience in the Partys year history will be discussed. Over its year struggle, the CPC has accumulated rich experience, understood important rules, developed governance theories and earned wisdom. This great treasure should be summarized to inspire the Partys governance better, Han Qingxiang said. Over the past  years, the CPC has adopted just two resolutions related to historical issues, in  and . They analyzed the causes and drew conclusions on important historical events and figures, through which the whole Party came to a clear consensus and thus grew stronger in unity. The Partys previous resolutions on historical issues played a profound role in building consensus and rallying strength to fulfill new missions. This is what we expect from the upcoming plenary session, said Wang Junwei, the research fellow. History has emerged as something of a buzzword for all CPC members this year. A sweeping education campaign helped cadres recognize the Partys history, and a new Museum of the CPC was inaugurated. On June , Xi and his colleagues toured the museum, viewing exhibits such as bonds issued by the Qing government used to pay for the war indemnity required by the unequal Treaty of Shimonoseki the manuscript of Karl Marxs notes from Brussels the list of the  CPC members when the Party was founded a car manufactured in the PRCs early years and the model of Chinas Mars rover. Each display bore vivid testimony to how the Party led China. The exhibition ended with a time tunnel, linking all significant historical junctures from  until today, leading the audience to the future. Xi once quoted Mao Zedong, saying that after several decades, the victory of the Chinese peoples democratic revolution, viewed in retrospect, will seem like only a brief prologue to a long drama. A drama begins with a prologue, but the prologue is not the climax. History has not ended, nor can it possibly end, he said at the conference marking the th anniversary of the CPCs founding. The CPC and Chinese people have every confidence in their ability to provide a Chinese solution to aid the exploration of a better social system for humanity. After concluding their exhibition tour, Xi and his colleagues took a vow in front of the Party flag, reliving a ritual undertaken by all new CPC members. I will fight for Communism for the rest of my life, Xi said, leading the oath.         President Xi Jinping front left, Russian President Vladimir Putin front right and other world leaders walk in front of the Beijing Yanqi Lake International Convention Center in Beijing on May , . The group had been attending the Leaders Roundtable Summit of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which leaders of key international organizations also took part in.
