Action urged to safeguard employees interests                                             A few days before the end of last year, Sol Ramel was busy raising funds in Hong Kong on her days off work to help typhoon survivors back home in the Philippines. She was also distributing food packages and winter clothes to newly arrived domestic workers in the city who were quarantined at hotels. Because of the pandemic, I was unable to go home for my yearly vacation and charity group mission. However, we can do something to extend our support, said Ramel, who has worked as a domestic helper in Hong Kong for more than  years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
