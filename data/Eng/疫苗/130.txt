Controlled borders are a proven pandemic barrier

Richard Cullen says a wide range of benefits have resulted from the HKSARs zeroCOVID approach                                  The necessity for Hong Kong to open its borders and start living with COVID is increasingly being urged from some quarters. International Chambers of Commerce based in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have argued this need, for example. And the international media, including CNN and The Economist, have recently run stories supporting the uptodate wisdom, as they see it, of living with COVID. The Economist argued in midOctober that China has decided it does not want to live with the virus. This was odd as Chinas top respiratory disease expert, Professor Zhong Nanshan, had, two weeks earlier, explicitly discussed the opening of Chinas borders, stressing the need for very high vaccination rates to be fully achieved. He spoke about the process of living with COVID in China once this was accomplished. The Economist also noted how other jurisdictions with zeroCOVID policies had moved to relax them, while China is holding out. The clear tilt in such stories is that the likes of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland are now, under this revised, mediaapproved, relaxed policy, somehow behind the times. These narratives, explicitly or implicitly, advance the idea that the cited jurisdictions which have relaxed, have wisely done so after completing international, comparative due diligence. In fact, all the named jurisdictions that have moved to live with COVID have done so primarily out of necessity. In Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, for example, the authorities lost control over the spread of COVID, despite their best efforts, after the arrival of the highly infectious Delta variant. The necessity of living with COVID has since been represented, in a number of cases, as a virtue. Even more starkly missing from most living with COVID advocacy is a candid squaring of the ledger. Those taking this sort of position rarely, if ever, pay attention to the patent advantages Hong Kong has enjoyed from largely maintaining a zeroCOVID policy for almost two years. These benefits are exceptionally important. Hong Kong has the longest life expectancy in the world, surpassing Japan. It has increased from  years in  to  years in . Studies that have looked at why this is so almost always note that wide access to good public health care is a key factor. The total population living in lowcost, public rental housing in the HKSAR is still over . million. Those worst off, around , people, live in over , subdivided units. More than . million people, about  percent of the population, live below the poverty line. Public hospitals and clinics handle millions of individual outpatient cases every year. More than  public hospitals provide around , beds  over  percent of the total. These services are always stretched  and waiting times are long for nonemergency illnesses. But this system does a vital job in looking after the medical welfare of Hong Kongs huge lowincome population. The work pressures on staff within these institutions are always very high. Ask anyone who uses this system and they will grumble about waiting times and confirm that over the last two years, it has continued to do its same oftenunsung, extraordinary work. Without question, Hong Kongs successful zeroCOVID approach has underwritten the ability of this system to continue looking after its huge, vulnerable client base so well. Here is a short thought experiment that helps add further perspective. Suppose Hong Kong had managed COVID in the way the United Kingdom has  the UK was one of the first to begin living with COVID, after all. Hong Kongs population is . percent of the UK population. Based on UK figures to date, one would expect to see, following the British approach, around , deaths and over  million COVID infections in the HKSAR instead of  deaths and less than , cases. One further grim consequence of the huge pressure placed on the British National Health System is the large numbers simply turned away from COVIDoverwhelmed hospitals. Apart from doing such an exceptional job of protecting Hong Kongs public health system from massive additional stress not least on staff, the zeroCOVID policy has arguably prevented many thousands of deaths and over  million infections. Lost sight of in much of the COVID debate is that the right to life is paramount among all human rights. There is no question that Hong Kongs COVID policies have been shaped by the primary need to open the border with the mainland, and this has reinforced the need to control movements into Hong Kong so strictly. This is, however, manifestly the most important border Hong Kong shares. In , before the violent political upheaval began, over  million mainland visitors made up almost  percent of total arrivals of  million. This is also the border that the vast majority of Hong Kong residents wish to see reopened as a priority. And for many professional expatriates residing in Hong Kong, this is also a crucial business border. The drawbacks of semiclosed borders are clear. Extended quarantine periods, for example make business significantly more difficult have a clear adverse effect on separated families and they add additional stress to daily life. These drawbacks are real but they are also selectively stressed. The wider, sustained benefits of the zeroCOVID approach are very great indeed but because of a failure to pay comprehensive attention to the complete picture, they are largely overlooked  or taken for granted  by those preoccupied with opening up to many international jurisdictions. Influential American literary critic H.L. Mencken once observed that for every complex problem there is always a simple solution  and it is always wrong. My fellow commentator Ho Loksang recently noted that the Hong Kong government has faced many tough choices in dealing with the complexities of the pandemic HKs pandemic situation demands tough choices, Oct , , published in China Daily Hong Kong Edition. Getting the balance right remains challenging  there are no seamless answers. Full openingup will come, however. In the meantime, a wide range of remarkable benefits have been securely banked  based on Hong Kongs zeroCOVID approach. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.                                                                                !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
