China making full use of its strength in production chains to help boost capacity worldwide                     China is contributing its fair share to help ease the global shortfall in COVID vaccines as it expands assistance to countries in dire need, advances vaccinerelated cooperation with eligible partners, boosts vaccine exports and gears up production.  Concerns are lingering globally about the widening gap between immunity and development around the world as highincome nations acquire more doses of vaccine than do poorer countries, observers and international health agencies have warned.  China has offered COVID vaccine assistance to  developing countries at their request, and it has exported or is exporting vaccines to  nations, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.  The nation has also been using its strength in production chains to help other countries manufacture vaccines in China or locally in order to boost global production capacity, Wang said on Wednesday via video link at a United Nations Security Council open briefing on ensuring equitable access to vaccines.  During the Spring Festival holiday, China delivered vaccine shipments to seven countries.  Leaders of countries such as Hungary greeted the shipments arrival at airports and expressed heartfelt thanks to China, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a daily news conference in Beijing on Thursday.  China has never sought geopolitical advantage in carrying out international cooperation on COVID vaccines, never calculated any economic gains and never attached any political conditions, Wang said.  But countries continue to face deficits in vaccine production capacity and global distribution, Wang warned.  He said all parties should join hands to oppose nationalistic vaccinerelated moves, promote fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, and, in particular, make them accessible and affordable for developing countries, including those in conflicts.  What we think about most is to let the vaccines become accessible and affordable public goods for the people of all countries, Wang said.  As of Thursday, the coronavirus had infected more than  million people and killed over . million, according to the World Health Organization.  UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres, who also attended the virtual meeting, said vaccine equity is the biggest moral test before the global community, and  countries have yet to receive a single dose of vaccine.  Major producers of COVID vaccines in China are working around the clock to increase supply to meet global needs.  The currently available vaccines made by China are available at lower prices than others and can be preserved safely at higher temperatures, which makes them more accessible to developing countries, experts and industry insiders said.  Yang Xiaoming, chairman of Sinopharms China National Biotech Group, a major COVID vaccine producer in China, said Beijings decision to supply  million doses of COVID vaccines to COVAX, the World Health Organizations global vaccine initiative, delivers on the commitment to make the vaccines a global public good.  The companys production capacity is expected to exceed  billion doses this year, Yang said.  We will try our best to produce more highquality vaccines as quickly as possible on the basis of safety and standards to contribute to fairer distribution of COVID vaccines, he said.  In addition, a second COVID vaccine production line has been completed by Sinovac, another of Chinas leading vaccine makers.  If the new line is put into use before the end of February, it will lead to the doubling of the companys annual production capacity for the vaccine, which will exceed  billion doses, Sinovac said.  Facing great demand in China and internationally, the company is producing its CoronaVac vaccine around the clock and at full capacity.  More than , of the companys employees gave up their Spring Festival holiday and continued working.  The pandemic is still spreading globally, and the war against the pandemic is far from over, said Yin Weidong, chairman of Sinovac.  The company will continue advancing clinical research on the vaccine and its registration and application in other countries and regions to boost the global fight against the pandemic and improve the accessibility and affordability of COVID vaccines globally, he said.  Since January, CoronaVac has won approval for emergency use in countries such as Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil and Argentina.  Sinovac has been supplying vaccines to these countries since the end of last year, and more than  million doses of CoronaVac vaccines have been administered overseas.
