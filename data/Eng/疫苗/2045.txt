The World Health Organization announced on Friday it will give emergency use authorization to the COVID vaccine manufactured by Chinas Sinopharm.The greenlight for the Sinopharm vaccine to be rolled out globally could pave the way for millions of doses to reach needy countries and boost WHObacked efforts such as the COVAX initiative, which is a global effort aimed at ensuring access in poorer nations to novel coronavirus vaccines.The WHO program has already distributed over  million doses of COVID vaccines.The move marks the first time any Chinesemade vaccine has received emergency authorization from the WHO.During a media briefing, the head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,said WHO gave Emergency Use Listing to Sinopharm Beijings COVID vaccine, making it the sixth vaccine to receive WHO validation for safety, efficacy and quality.He added This expands the list of COVID vaccines that COVAX can buy, and gives countries confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval, and to import and administer a vaccine.The Sinopharm vaccine joins a list of WHO approved vaccines, in addition to those made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson  Johnson and Moderna.The addition of this vaccine has the potential to rapidly accelerate COVID vaccine access for countries seeking to protect health workers and populations at risk, said Mariangela Simao, WHO assistantdirector general for Access to Health Products. We urge the manufacturer to participate in the COVAX Facility and contribute to the goal of more equitable vaccine distribution.The WHO has recommended the jab for people aged  to  years, in a twodose schedule with a spacing of three to four weeks.The organization said the vaccine efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalized disease was estimated to be  percent, all age groups combined.Experts say the Sinopharm vaccine is easy to store, making it highly suitable for lowresource settings.The WHO said it is also the first vaccine that will carry a vaccine vial monitor, a small sticker on thevaccine vialsthat change color as thevaccineis exposed to heat, letting health workers know whether thevaccinecan be safelyused.Arnaud Didierlaurent, a professor at the University of Genevas medical school who chairs the advisory group, said it had requested additional studies from Sinopharm, and that there would be continuous evaluation of the vaccine and noted that work does not stop after the listing.The Sinopharm vaccine has already been authorized by many countries around the world, with some  million doses distributed.Recipients of the vaccine include those in Latin America such as Brazil, Mexico and Chile as well as countries in Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.
