Hong Kong is no stranger to dealing with financial dilemmas. It has gone through thick and thin, overcoming crisis after crisis in the past several decades. The coronavirus onslaught has brought much pain to the citys business and social life. Tourism, as one of Hong Kongs pillar industries, has had more than its fair share of the suffering, already battered by a year of social turmoil. But upon the rd anniversary of the special administrative regions return to the motherland, industry heavyweights have held their heads high, convinced that the sector is reassured of a promising future and will see a spectacular rebound under the successful implementation of one country, two systems. The muchawaited national security law for the SAR is expected be another catalyst for restoring peace and order, and ensuring a stable environment for economic progress, especially for tourism, they said.       Hong Kongs tourism business has been on a roll since the handover in , especially after  when tourists from the Chinese mainland were allowed to visit the SAR on an individual basis, noted Lo Suion, director and honorary chairman of China Travel Service Hong Kong  the first mainlandrun travel agency set up in the SAR and now one of the largest travel institutes in the city. Prior to the social unrest that broke out in midJune last year, the city hosted more than  million visitors in , topping the world charts in terms of tourist numbers to any single destination within a specified period. In , tourism accounted for . percent of Hong Kongs gross domestic product, with close to  percent of the visitors coming from the mainland. Lo, whos also a Hong Kong deputy to the National Peoples Congress  the nations top legislature  said the steady development of one country, two systems has ushered in a golden age for the SARs tourism industry, driving the growth of the retail, hospitality, transport and catering sectors and creating more than , jobs  more than  percent of the local labor force. While the protest violence has dealt a heavy blow to tourism, Lo believes the implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong will effectively help restore peace and order in the city. Confident about the citys political situation in the long run, he stressed that stability will create a conducive environment for tourism. However, he said Hong Kong still has a lot to do to rebuild its reputation as a popular international travel destination that has been tarnished by the unrest. The task of promoting Hong Kong tourism in the global market and restoring the citys hospitality, especially among mainland travelers, is paramount, he stressed. Lo would like the SAR government to take the lead in promoting local residents awareness of the importance of tourism to Hong Kongs economic development, and make them feel its vital to attract visitors by showing their hospitality. China Travel Service Hong Kong Chairman Yiu Siwing, who represents the tourism sector in the Legislative Council, hailed the central governments unwavering support for the SARs tourism sector, notably the Individual Visit Scheme and the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, enabling the tourism business to make an enormous contribution to the SARs economic growth in the past  years.       Noting that the COVID outbreak might continue for a year or two before a vaccine is available, Yiu hoped the SAR government can promote local travel by developing new tourist spots and improving the quality of services. He also urged the government to accelerate implementing a travel bubble in the GuangdongHong KongMacao Greater Bay Area, realizing the free flow of people through mutual recognition of health codes in cooperation with the authorities in the Macao SAR and Guangdong province. Tourism, he believes, can be revived once the pandemic is over, with Hong Kongs solid foundation in the industry and its close links with the mainland, as well as neighboring countries and regions. Timothy Chui Tingpong, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association and director of the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong, said that amid a global economic recession, Hong Kong has to ensure that tourism recovers so that peoples livelihood can be improved by creating more jobs. The community is called to support tourism, and industry players must upgrade the quality of services to cater to the needs of all travelers in a time of uncertainty, he said. heshusichinadailyhk.com                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
