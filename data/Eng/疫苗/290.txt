About  kilometers northwest of downtown, an international testing program for bobsled and skeleton is in full swing at Yanqings National Sliding Center, with foreign athletes experiencing the .kilometer Olympic track for the first time since its completion this summer. The first responses we have from the athletes taking part in these test events are extremely positive, Bach told Chinese Central Television in Greece after the flame was lit on Oct . Therefore, we are even more confident in the success of these Olympic Winter Games. We could see a lot of Chinese efficiency in all these efforts ... The preparations for the Games have made progress, despite all the restrictions related to the pandemic, he added. Beijing  organizers, however, reiterated that its not time to relax just yet. The test events have been progressing so far so good in the sense of helping us identify areas to improve, either in the function of facilities or in service details, for better experiences when the real business gets going in February, said Yao Hui, venue management director of the Beijing  organizing committee. Even having received a lot of positive feedback, we still need to stay clearheaded in our review of the test events and make quick fixes wherever needed as carefully as we can. Scheduled to open at pm on Feb , the Games are expected to welcome around , athletes, representing approximately  countries and regions, to the most genderbalanced Winter Olympics in history. Safety first With the pandemic still ongoing, Beijing  organizers are firmly focused on trialing customized COVID containment measures over the next  days and making any necessary adjustments for a safe yet comfortable experience of all participants. According to protocols presented to the International Olympic Committee earlier this month, all athletes and participants at next years Games will be urged to be fully vaccinated before arriving in China. Those who arrive unvaccinated will have to observe a day quarantine period as currently required for ordinary international visitors. All Games participants will be required to stay within a biosecure bubble at all times under closedloop management and be subject to daily testing and health checks. They will only be permitted to travel between their designated accommodation and the sports venues on official transport vehicles, according to Beijing  organizers.

The Games will be without international spectators, with ticketing only available to residents in the Chinese mainland, who meet certain COVID control requirements, to reduce the risk of imported infections. Despite adopting a tighter bubble management than deployed at the Tokyo Summer Games, the return of fans to the stands raises the prospect of a more exciting spectacle at Beijing .

I am thankful to all of you for making it so well. Now we just need the audience to build up the energy all together because its all set.
