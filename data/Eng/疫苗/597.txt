Fully vaccinated people do not need coronavirus booster shots now, said an international group of scientists in a paper published in a medical journal on Monday.In the paper published in The Lancet, the experts, including two outgoing United States Food and Drug Administration vaccine regulators, said they reviewed studies of the vaccines performance and concluded that shots are working well despite the very contagious Delta variant, especially against severe disease.Currently available studies do not provide credible evidence of substantially declining protection against severe disease, which is the primary goal of vaccination, said Ana Maria HenaoRestrepo, the studys author and a World Health Organization epidemiologist, in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
