Quoting Christian Happi, an infectious diseases expert at Nigerias Redeemers University, the AP said in a report on Thursday that donations from rich countries are both insufficient and unreliable, especially as they have not only taken most of the worlds supplies but are moving on to vaccinate children and considering administering booster shots. The report also noted that in addition to its planned vaccine exports, China announced plans to donate  million U.S. dollars to help buy more doses for developing countries.
