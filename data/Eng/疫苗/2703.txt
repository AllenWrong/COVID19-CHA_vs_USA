Despite the public discord on show when United States and Chinese officials met in Alaska last week, that the meeting took place at all is a good thing, according to an observer of the bilateral relationship.I think the main purpose of the meeting was to establish direct official contact at this authoritative level and to create a foundation for future official exchanges, David Firestein, president and CEO of the George H.W. Bush Foundation for USChina Relations, told China Daily on Monday. I believe these basic goals were achieved.At the invitation of the US, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, and Wang Yi, Chinese State Councilor and foreign minister, met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in Anchorage on Thursday and Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
