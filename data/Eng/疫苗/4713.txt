As President Xi Jinping pointed out in his speech at the opening ceremony of the rd World Health Assembly on Monday, the COVID pandemic has provided the world with a chance to see how crucial international solidarity and cooperation are in responding to a global health threat. His earnest call for the World Health Organization to play the leading role in advancing such cooperation and for a global reserve and transportation hub of public health emergency supplies to be created in cooperation with the United Nations, along with his pledge that China will provide  billion to support the global fight against the virus over the next two years and assist the most vulnerable African countries, as well as make any vaccines it may develop against the virus a global public good have driven home the countrys determination to stand with other countries in the face of this global emergency. His remarks are in stark contrast to those of his United States counterpart, who penned a scathing letter to WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the same day, in which he gave the international body a day ultimatum to stop being Chinas puppet or he would permanently freeze US funding of the WHO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
