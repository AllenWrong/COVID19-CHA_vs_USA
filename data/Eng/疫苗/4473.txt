Africas total number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed ,, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Latest statistics from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that South Africa, which has , cases, has well over half the reported cases on the continent and ranks fifth globally in the number of infections.  On Friday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said schools were closing for four weeks to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, which he described as a storm hitting the country.  We have taken a deliberately cautious approach to keep schools closed during a period when the country is expected to experience its greatest increase in infections, Ramaphosa said in a televised address to the nation.  The schools closure order came a week after South Africas teachers unions urged the authorities to close schools through August.  Following the easing of restrictions initially introduced to curb the spread of the virus, infections are reported to be climbing rapidly in most African countries, including Kenya, East Africas economic hub which has so far reported more than , cases.  Last week, Cyrus Oguna, Kenyas government spokesman, admitted to having contracted the coronavirus and said he was at an isolation facility. According to a statement posted on social media, Oguna said he had developed mild symptoms after returning to capital Nairobi from an assignment.  I urge all Kenyans to take this disease seriously and take all the necessary precautions to avoid getting infected, Oguna said.  In a joint effort to enhance research and development of traditional medicines for the coronavirus in Africa, the World Health Organization and the Africa CDC on Friday launched an expert advisory committee to provide independent scientific advice and support to countries on the safety, efficacy and quality of traditional medicine therapies.  The member Regional Expert Committee on Traditional Medicine for COVID will support countries in collaborative efforts to conduct clinical trials of traditional medicines in compliance with international standards.  By pooling expertise within the continent, the committee is expected to accelerate the pace and elevate the standards of research, particularly clinical research on new therapies from traditional medicines against the coronavirus.  The WHO said it recognizes that traditional, complementary and alternative medicine have many benefits and Africa has a long history of traditional medicine and practitioners that play an important role in providing care to populations.  Interest in traditional medicine as potential remedies for COVID is growing in Africa. As the world races to find treatment and vaccines against the virus, research into traditional and orthodox medicines as potential COVID therapy must be grounded in science, and this measure marks an important step in supporting these endeavors, Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said.  According to John Nkengasong, director of Africa CDC and WHO special envoy on COVID for Africa, commendable efforts are ongoing on the continent to find coronavirus therapies in traditional medicine. He said rigorous clinical testing to evaluate safety and efficacy will be critical, similar to other areas of medicine.  The members of the regional expert committee are mainly from research institutions, national regulatory authorities, traditional medicine programs, public health departments, academia, medical pharmacy professions and civil society organizations of member states.  Africa CDC said the committee will start working immediately. Developing a master protocol to guide countries on clinical trials for COVID and setting the agenda to support member states will be among the committees initial tasks.  otiatochinadaily.com.cn         A medical worker treats coronavirus patients at a temporary hospital built on a football field in Machakos, Kenya on Thursday.
