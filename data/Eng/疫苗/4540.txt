WASHINGTON  The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID announced the establishment of a new clinical trials network on Wednesday aiming to step up vaccines and monoclonal antibodies testing, as the countrys confirmed COVID cases surpassed  million.More than ,, COVID cases have been reported in the United States with the fatalities surpassing , as of Wednesday evening, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.The new network, called the COVID Prevention Trials Network, will enroll thousands of volunteers in largescale clinical trials testing a variety of investigational vaccines and monoclonal antibodies intended to protect people from COVID.Starting this summer, this new network will leverage existing infrastructure and engage communities to secure the thousands of volunteers needed for latestage clinical trials of promising vaccines, said US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar.Having a safe and effective medical countermeasure to prevent COVID would enable us to not only save lives but also help end the global pandemic, said NIAID Director Anthony Fauci.The new network is expected to operate more than  clinical trial sites across the United States and internationally, according to the NIAID.It is part of ongoing efforts across the country in speeding up the development of vaccines and therapies against COVID.According to Fauci, the US government will fund and conduct key studies on three experimental coronavirus vaccines in the summer.Phase  trials, which typically involve tens of thousands of people and measure whether a vaccine is safe and effective, will begin with one by Moderna in July, then an OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine in August and one by Johnson  Johnson in September.Fauci said that the testing plans still track with the timeline that he has suggested in the past a vaccine at scale by the end of the year or early next year.Remdesivir, the only drug that has an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID, has shown promising results and sets a new standard of care for COVID patients.In order to expand the potential uses of the drug against SARSCoV, American biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences has announced plans to explore administration of remdesivir in an inhaled form.According to Azar, more than , courses of remdesivir have been distributed to all of  states.Meanwhile, investigators continue to study whether bloodplasma transfusions from recovered COVID patients are safe and improve outcomes for severelyill patients.More than , patients have received the transfusions so far, according to a national online registry the Mayo Clinic coordinates.
