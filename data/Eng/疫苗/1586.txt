CureVac vaccine fails to meet efficacy target

PhotoAgencies    Trials fall short of achieving  percent threshold recommended by the WHO German biotechnology company CureVac has announced that its COVID vaccine registered a disappointing  percent efficacy at preventing infection during latestage trials, meaning it failed to reach the  percent efficacy threshold recommended by the World Health Organization. The results are a blow to the global pandemic fight because CureVac had hoped to boost international supply by  million doses by the end of . The companys vaccine, CVnCoV, uses similar mRNA technology to the jabs from Pfizer and Moderna, which both achieved highefficacy levels in clinical trials. One main distinction is that Pfizer and Moderna employ modified genetic material, whereas CureVac uses natural mRNA. The CureVac jab also involves a lower dose than the other two.  CureVac said the emergence of a multitude of COVID variants may have impacted the Phase b trial for CVnCoV, which involved a total , participants in Latin America and Europe. At least  variants circulated within the study population during the study, the company reported. While we were hoping for a stronger interim outcome, we recognize that demonstrating high efficacy in this unprecedented broad diversity of variants is challenging, said FranzWerner Haas, chief executive of CureVac. Between January and March, CureVac entered into partnerships with three major pharmaceutical companies for its CVnCoV vaccine. A deal with Bayer in Germany involved supply for several hundred million doses, while the UKs GSK and Switzerlands Celonic both agreed to manufacture  million doses each this year. In parallel, GSK and CureVac said they would work together on a new COVID vaccine for release in . The CVnCoV jab is also part of an ongoing UK trial into COVID booster vaccines. CureVac stock dropped by  percent in extended trading in New York on Wednesday after the publication of the trial results. CureVac sequenced viral samples from  out of the  cases of COVID infection that occurred during the trial. Out of these, only one case was attributed to what the company called the original strain of the virus that was in circulation when CVnCoV development began in January . Socalled variants of concern caused  percent of the cases, CureVac said. WHO currently designates four strains  Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta  within this classification. The rest of the cases were made up by less common or emerging strains, including a socalled variant of interest called Lambda, which has been responsible for a rising proportion of infections in South America since early spring. Recent studies have shown that available vaccines may be somewhat less effective at protecting against certain variants. According to research from Public Health Scotland published in the journal the Lancet on Monday, a full course of the Pfizer vaccine is  percent effective at preventing infection from the Alpha variant, whereas that number falls to  percent for the Delta variant. With the AstraZeneca vaccine, protection fell from  percent to  percent for those two variants, respectively. Data from Public Health England published this week found that both vaccines were still above  percent effective at preventing hospitalizations among those infected with the Delta variant. The variantrich environment underlines the importance of developing nextgeneration vaccines as new virus variants continue to emerge, Haas said. CureVac said it will continue with trials and will assess the most appropriate regulatory pathway when final results are posted.
