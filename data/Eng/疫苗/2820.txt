PhotoAgencies    SAO PAULO  A possible new variant of the novel coronavirus, SARSCoV, has been detected in several regions of Brazil, the Ministry of Science and Technologys National Laboratory for Scientific Computing LNCC said Friday. Brazilian scientists discovered the new variant as the countrys healthcare system nears collapse due to a rise in cases generated by the P. strain that emerged in northern Brazils state of Amazonas in November . A study carried out in  municipalities of five Brazilian states led to the identification of a possible new variant of SARSCoV originating from variant B... that had circulated in Brazil, the laboratory said Friday in a statement. This latest variant contains a mutation that could complicate the planning of new strategies to control COVID, the laboratory warned. The results of the study were reported in the international coronavirus genome database GISAID. The growing need for effective genomic surveillance to be able to identify potential viral mutations early is clear, thus helping to improve current vaccines against COVID, the laboratory said. Brazil has reported ,, COVID cases, with , deaths, since the start of the pandemic.
