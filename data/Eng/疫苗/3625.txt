Brexit, which has dominated politics on both sides of the Channel since , became reality an hour before midnight, ending the UKs year obligation to follow Brussels rules. Free movement of more than  million people between Britain and the  EU states ended. More rigorous customs checks returned for the first time in decades, despite the hardfought brokering of a tariffand quotafree trade deal. New Years Day newspapers reflected the historic but still deeply divisive change, which will have repercussions for generations to come. The proBrexit Daily Express frontpage photograph showed the White Cliffs of Doveran enduring symbol of Britishnesswith Freedom written on a Union flag. Our Future. Our Britain. Our Destiny, its headline says. The proEU Independent, though, was less sureOff the hookor cut adrift? it asked, reflecting widespread uncertainty at the path the country had now chosen. As dawn broke on , attention turned to Britains borders, particularly its key Channel seaports, to see if the end to seamless trade and travel would cause delays and disruption. But with New Years Day a public holiday followed by a weekend, and the government having announced the phased introduction of checks, few immediate problems were envisaged. The traffic forecast for the next few days is very light, said John Keefe, spokesman for Eurotunnel, which transports freight, cars and coaches under the Channel.
