Washingtons COVID measures endanger its people, exacerbated spread of pandemic                     For more than a year, the United States response to the COVID pandemic has been a miserable failure, both nationally and internationally, said a report released on Monday.  The report, America Ranked First?! The Truth about Americas Fight against COVID, said the US has not only disrupted global efforts to fight the coronavirus, but also cast US citizens into a deepening crisis, with the country now facing a fourth wave of infections and a new high in confirmed cases.  While the world has raced to strengthen international vaccine cooperation and promote their fair and equitable distribution, the US has engaged in vaccine nationalism and made it more difficult for developing countries to obtain vaccines, the report said, noting that it has exported less than  percent of USmade vaccines.  Months of COVID vaccine hoarding in the US also led to enormous vaccine wastage as domestic demand declined. Doses that could have vaccinated at least  million people were in danger of expiring in the US, The Washington Post reported on July .  In addition, the US government has disrupted international antipandemic efforts by politicizing the origin tracing of the virus, coercing the World Health Organization and some scientists to give up their objective and impartial positions, according to the report jointly released in Beijing by three think tanks the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, Taihe Institute and Intellisia Institute.  Washington has targeted China on the issue of virus origin tracing. US President Joe Biden recently ordered an official investigation into the possibility of an origin link between the novel coronavirus and a laboratory in Wuhan, Hubei province.  Martin Jacques, a former senior fellow at Cambridge University, said at a seminar where the report was released that the attack on China is a strategy of distraction and deflection aimed at tarnishing Chinas reputation to the greatest degree, and to distract from the poor US performance.  COVID is mired in a sort of Cold War rhetoric, Cold War language, and Cold War assault by the US, and this is going to continue, Jacques said via video link.  The US government has failed to take effective exit control measures, which the report said has indirectly exacerbated the global spread of the pandemic.  When the US was facing its peak of the pandemic, the number of US citizens traveling abroad also peaked.  From November  to January , as the average daily confirmed cases exceeded ,, the average daily number of US citizens traveling abroad reached the peak of ,, according to official figures.  The US government also was exporting the virus by returning thousands of illegal immigrants to developing countries that were not equipped to deal with it, intensifying COVID deterioration in those countries.  Tang Bei, an international relations researcher at Shanghai International Studies University, said the US is prone to attributing health threats to foreign countries, especially developing countries, thus ignoring the problems within its own borders.  With the US recorded its highest daily case loads over six months, its poor performance in dealing with COVID cast its own people into a crisis.  According to Johns Hopkins University, the US has had the most COVID infections of any country, with more than . million confirmed cases and more than , deaths as of Monday.  A growing partisan divide is seen as the main reason behind the poor US COVID response at home, the report said, adding that it presented the image of a Disunited America in the fight against the pandemic.  The antipandemic policy became a bargaining chip in the political game between the political parties. In this way, the warring parties have become the biggest obstacle in the prevention and control of the pandemic, ignoring the overall interests and health of the US citizens, the report said.  COVID was probably the greatest test of governance the world has seen since the Second World War. The United States and the West failed miserably. China, on the contrary, has been extraordinarily successful, Martin said.  zhaoruinanchinadaily.com.cn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
