The upcoming rd World Health Assembly, or WHA, will not only focus on how to defeat the COVID pandemic but also on how the world can build stronger health systems, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday.  The WHA will be held over May  as a virtual conference and with a shorter schedule. As the WHOs decisionmaking body, the WHA is attended by delegations from all WHO member states to determine the policies of the organization, appoint its directorgeneral, supervise financial policies and review and approve the proposed program budget.  WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the novel coronavirus outbreak has been an unprecedented shock to the world.  But he stressed that through national unity and global solidarity the world can save both lives and livelihoods and ensure that other health services for neglected diseases, child vaccination, HIV, tuberculosis and malaria continue to both function and improve.  During the World Health Assembly next week we will discuss with health leaders from across the world not only how to defeat COVID but also how we can build back stronger health systems everywhere, he told a virtual news conference from Geneva.  We have a onceinalifetime opportunity to prove that the world is more than just a collection of individual countries with colorful flags.  He said that the pandemic has made it crystal clear that we are one world that has more in common with each other than wed ever dare to believe.  Attention on prisoners  On Wednesday, Tedros urged that attention be paid to the heightened vulnerability of prisoners during the pandemic.  Overcrowding in prisons undermines hygiene, health, safety and human dignity, according to the WHO chief, who added that a health response to COVID in closed settings alone is insufficient.  On Wednesday, the WHO joined the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, or UNODC, the Joint UN Programme on HIVAIDS and the UN Human Rights Office in issuing a joint statement on COVID in prisons and other closed settings.  We urge political leaders to ensure that COVID preparedness and responses in closed settings are identified and implemented in line with fundamental human rights and are guided by WHO guidance and recommendations to protect human health, he said.  In the United States, eight Florida prisons have become hot spots for COVID, with the number of inmates testing positive for the disease continuing to soar even as the state loosens restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the virus, the News Service of Florida reported on Tuesday.  chenweihuachinadaily.com.cn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
