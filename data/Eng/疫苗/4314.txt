Adding to the harm caused by the yearlong violent antiextraditionbill campaign and the SinoUS trade row, the eightmonthlong COVID pandemic has taken its toll on both Hong Kongs economy and peoples livelihoods. The economy plunged by  percent in the second quarter compared to a year ago, the fourth consecutive quarter of yearonyear contraction in GDP. The economy is in its worst shape in more than a decade. Along with the economy, the livelihoods of many residents have been hard hit as socialdistancing measures and fear of the viruss threat to health and life have suffocated many economic activities, with service sectors, including catering, transportation and retailing, bearing the brunt. Many Hong Kong residents are now in hot water amid a record unemployment rate under the cloud of the pandemic. Life is especially hard for lowincome families. A recent survey revealed that the jobless and underemployment rate among Hong Kongs lowincome residents is about eight times higher than the overall unemployment rate, at . percent from May to July, near the highest in more than a decade. The jobless rate would have shot up much higher  probably to an unprecedented level  had it not been for the governments Employment Support Scheme, which has doled out rounds of financial subsidies to businesses, preventing them from laying off more staff or going bust altogether. With their livelihoods ruined by the pandemic, many residents have been enduring unbearable financial stress, which has contributed to a reported rise in the number of cases of mental illness. There is no way Hong Kong society can get rid of these woes until we get the economy back to normal, which is unlikely until the COVID pandemic is put under control. In the absence of effective vaccines, cutting off the transmission chains of the novel coronavirus is the only way to achieve that. The SAR government has pinned high hopes on the Universal Community Testing Programme so have many Hong Kong residents as evidenced by their strong support for it. But for the plan to achieve the desired results, the participation of all residents is necessary. The success of the testing program is crucial to the normalization of life, the recovery of the economy, and the removal of Hong Kong residents woes. Most importantly, it is a matter of life and death for the vulnerable population. The political radicals who have left no stone unturned to undermine the testing campaign in their attempt to promote their political agenda need to be reminded that no loftysounding slogans can cover up the fact that they prioritize partisan interests over the wellbeing of society.                                                                                !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
