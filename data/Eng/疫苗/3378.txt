Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, told a virtual press conference that he doesnt believe the world should start setting elimination or eradication of this virus as the bar for success. That is not the bar for success. The bar for success is reducing the capacity of this virus to kill, to put people in hospital, to destroy our economic and social lives, Ryan said. Asked whether COVID will become an endemic, he emphasized that for the foreseeable future, the coverage of vaccines will not reach a point where it will stop transmission. So were likely to have continued transmission. Noting that countries should probably not expect to get rid of the virus by , Ryan reminded that so far in human history weve only ever eradicated one disease on this planet smallpox. We have to reach a point where were in control of the virus, he said.
