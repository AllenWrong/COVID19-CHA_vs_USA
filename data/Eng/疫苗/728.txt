The US Federal Reserve in Washington DC. PhotoAgencies    Economic recovery has proved elusive in Asia, thanks to the Wests pandemic mismanagement and vaccine inequality. The Feds impending tapering will add to the woes. On Friday, Jay Powell suggested that the US central bank had met one of the two goals it had sought to achieve before reducing its monthly  billion asset purchase program. In the closelywatched speech at the Jackson Hole conference, the Fed chair said that substantial further progress test has been met for inflation. There has also been clear progress toward maximum employment. The majority of the Fed officials believe it is appropriate to start tapering the bondbuying program in the fall. In effect, the Fed cannot avoid tapering. Why the Fed needs to taper Instead of responding to the WHOs coronavirus warnings in January , the Fed, like the Trump White House, took its time. It awoke only after the WHOs declaration of the global pandemic two months later. On March , , the Fed slashed its shortterm benchmark interest rate to near zero. To provide additional stimulus, it began purchasing  billion monthly in Treasury and mortgage securities. While US headline and core inflation are currently above , significantly higher than the Feds  inflation target, recent jobs report suggests the recovery is broadening. Yet, the big picture is mixed. While Powell was speaking, the White House more than doubled its forecast for annual inflation in new projections, as supplychain disruptions continue to put upward pressure on prices, due to the pandemic and the Delta variant. The consumerprice index is now expected to steady at . in fall . Yet, critics believe the Fed is stoking still another real estate price bubble that threatens to wipe out home equity. The cold reality is that the longer the Fed maintains its excessively loose monetary policy, the more it is generating excess liquidity, which is fostering inflation. That is likely to prove costly in the future. Over a decade of ultraloose fiscal and monetary policies have put the global economy on track for a slowmotion train wreck. Officially, the Feds dual mandate is to focus on price stability and full employment. International implications remain a secondary consideration. PBOC cautious, BOJ limited, BOK hiking What is the strategy of the Peoples Bank of China PBOC toward the Feds tapering? The simple answer In the shortterm, cautiously accommodative. In the mediumterm, cautiously neutral. If warranted, PBOC is likely to inject liquidity to avoid tightening of monetary conditions. Unlike the major economies in the West, China has largely contained the novel coronavirus and is rebounding ahead of other major economies. In contrast, Japan faces extraordinary challenges. Expremier Shinzo Abes structural reforms proved inadequate, despite huge fiscal stimulus packages, ultralow rates and rounds of quantitative easing. Secular challenges have been coupled with the COVID surge. Amid the rising political discontent, Premier Suga is battling for his political future. Inflation remains close to , with interest rate at .. The maneuverability of the Bank of Japans is limited. Sovereign debt is close to  of GDP and rising. Two days before Powells speech, the Bank of Korea raised its interest to ., as the first developed economy to do so in the pandemic era. It was necessitated by financial risks pressuring the economy, including heated house prices and rising household debt. The move is not likely to be followed by Asias other central banks. Central banks uneasy in Southeast Asia Instead of the muchanticipated recovery, Southeast Asia is struggling with the Delta variant and vaccine inequality, which have resulted in slower vaccination rollouts. Hence, the lowered GDP forecasts across the region. With policy rates at a historical low, Southeast Asia will soon have to cope with the Feds impending rate hikes. Since early spring , all regional economies have been busy cutting their rates. While the rates have almost halved in both Vietnam interest rate . and Indonesia ., their central banks continue to have adequate policy space. In turn, the central banks of the Philippines . and Malaysia . still have significant space available. By contrast, Thailands . options are now more limited. Foreignexchange fluctuations reflect the new realities. Before the pandemic, the Thai baht was still the strongestperforming regional currency. But it has plunged more than  against the US dollar. Malaysian ringgit and the Philippine peso about  remain somewhat exposed, whereas Singapore dollar and Indonesian rupiah about  are better positioned. Vietnamese dong has actually appreciated  relative to the US dollar, thanks to foreignexchange truce with Washington. The coming economic storm Even today, the US economy, central bank and dollar serve as the yardsticks for international performance. Yet, the Biden administrations multitrilliondollar infrastructure investment initiatives ignore the countrys dire fundamentals. US sovereign debt is close to  of GDP and climbing ever faster. Persistent budget deficits will cause the federal debt to double in size over the next three decades. In the past four decades, the strength of the greenback, as measured by the US dollar index DXY has progressively weakened, despite the Feds hikes. After Paul Volckers massive rate hikes in the early s, the index peaked at . In the early s, it was barely . In the past year, it has lingered around  to  Figure.

It was down . for the week the sharpest decline since early May. As global growth prospects are fueled by large emerging economies, the global economy is being held hostage by a graying, excessively indebted single currency. For some time, data by the International Monetary Fund IMF has suggested that the dollar may be losing its draw as a reserve currency. The longstanding debate on the US dollar as the worlds reserve currency will intensify in the coming months. Perhaps it made sense in , when the US economy still accounted for half of the global economy. But today those days of wine and roses are way gone.
