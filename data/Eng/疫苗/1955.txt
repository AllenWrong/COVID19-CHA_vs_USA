Reaction mixed to CDCs new nomask guidance
2021-05-17 00:00
Its a great day for America, US President Joe Biden said on Thursday after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that fully vaccinated people no longer needed to wear a mask. But many, including state and city officials, health experts, retail store chains and the general public, werent so sure.  The CDC also removed the need for social distancing in many cases for those who are fully vaccinated. The recommendations dont apply, however, to healthcare settings including doctors offices while traveling on planes, trains or buses and in transportation hubs such as airports and train stations and in correctional facilities and homeless shelters.  The guidance comes just two weeks after the CDC recommended that fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks indoors in all settings and outdoors in large crowds.  CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said her agency changed guidance as more scientific studies showed the effectiveness of the vaccines is extremely high. They protect more than  percent of recipients against any symptoms of COVID, prevent nearly all serious disease and death and even block most asymptomatic cases, she said.  Retailers including Walmart, Trader Joes and Costco announced maskfree shopping for fully vaccinated customers, except where required by state or local mandate.  Target, Home Depot, CVS, Macys, the Gap and Kroger Co, the nations biggest grocery store chain, said in statements that they will reevaluate their mask policies for customers based on the CDC guidance. Face coverings will still be required when entering Starbucks.  Walt Disney CEO Bob Chapek hailed the CDCs new guidance and told investors in an earnings call that it would quickly boost attendance at Disneys theme parks, water parks and other venues. He also said he expects it to have an immediate effect on business.  Governors in Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon and Pennsylvania quickly announced that they would drop mask requirements. Those in states with mask mandates such as New York, North Carolina and Virginia, and the mayors of New York City and Washington, DC, said they were reviewing the guidance.  In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy said on Friday that the state would stick with its indoor mask mandate, which he said helped curb the spread of the virus. With all respect to the CDC, we have made extraordinary progress, he said while touring a vaccination site.  The biggest question prompted by the new guidance has been How do people know who has or has not been vaccinated? There is no way to distinguish between those who are fully vaccinated and those who arent, short of asking to see a vaccine card.  Roughly  percent of people in the US are fully vaccinated and have received the CDC card, the agency said. But scammers also have seized the opportunity to forge the lowtech cards, as well as sell stolen authentic cards to unvaccinated individuals.  Increased risk feared  There is no way to know who is vaccinated and who is not in most scenarios, Lisa Maragakis, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told the Washington Post. The likely result is that almost no one will wear a mask.  The risk for people who havent yet been vaccinated, including millions of adolescents and children, is going to dramatically increase as the rest of the population abruptly drops masking, she added.  Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University, told The Associated Press that the CDC guidance is confusing and contradictory.  The public will not feel comfortable in a crowded indoor space if they are unsure if the maskless person standing next to them is or is not vaccinated, he said.  Other health experts said the CDC made a good call and the new guidance will entice people to get vaccinated as long as they see the benefits of being inoculated.  I know many on Twitter are saying the unvaccinated will simply say they were vaxed. Some will, but many wont want to, theyll now view vaccination as something with more value and seek it out, tweeted Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration.  US senators Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican, and Joni Ernst of Iowa, a Republican, removed their masks and yelled freedom after the news broke. Free at last, declared Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a Republican, as he left Capitol Hill without a mask.  In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, said she isnt changing rules requiring masks on the House floor. No, Pelosi told CNN. Are they all vaccinated?  The new guidance had an immediate impact at the White House. Staffers were told that masks are no longer required for people who are fully vaccinated. Biden and VicePresident Kamala Harris appeared at the White House Rose Garden without masks, and neither put one on again after Bidens remarks.  aihepingchinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
