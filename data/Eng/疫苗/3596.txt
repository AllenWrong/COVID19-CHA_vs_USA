At Sinopharms manufacturing site in Beijings suburbs, filled vials of the vaccinewhich had passed automated checks filtering out faulty doseswere packaged, labeled and coded, ready to make their way to inoculation sites across the country. This production line is able to complete the packaging of more than  vials per minute.  and each dose is assigned an identification code that allows us to examine if the entire production, distribution and immunization procedures are up to standard, said Yang Xiaoming, chairman of China National Biotech Group, a subsidiary of Sinopharm, during a livestreaming session on Monday. The twodose vaccine, created by Sinopharms Beijing Institute of Biological Products, is the first to receive conditional approval from Chinas top drug regulator after showing a . percent efficacy rate from the ongoing stage clinical trials last week.

To fulfill domestic and global demand, we have built three new plants equipped with biosafety precautions to make the liquid doses, and set up new facilities devoted to filling vials and packaging, he said. The goal is to bring qualified doses to every person who needs the vaccine at a faster rate, Yang added. According to Sinopharm, the annual production capacity in its facilities in Beijing is expected to rise from  million at the moment to  billion by the end of this year. As factory staff works tirelessly to ensure the smooth operation of production lines, Yang said a major challenge is to assign a limited workforce and ensure every step is monitored by qualified professionals. As manufacturers, we are responsible for ensuring the quantity and quality of vaccines at the same time, he said. The vaccine from Sinopharm is one of five domestic vaccines undergoing stage clinical trials overseas, making China a global frontrunner for COVID vaccines.
