Current intelligence reinforces the belief that the virus most likely originated naturally, from animalhuman contact and was not deliberately engineered, reported CNN, quoting sources. White House Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci has recently said that he believes the natural origins theory of the novel coronavirus is still the most likely. The most likely explanation is a natural evolution from an animal reservoir to a human, Fauci, also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, told CNN during a recent interview. Paul Offit, a member of the US Food and Drug Administrations vaccine advisory committee, echoed Faucis remarks. I think the chance that this was created by laboratory workers  that it was engineered  is zero, Offit told CNN in a separate interview. Matthew Kavanagh, director of the Global Health Policy  Politics Initiative at Georgetown University, told Rolling Stone, a US magazine, earlier this month that US President Joe Bidens use of the intelligence community and not health officials to conduct a review into the origins of the coronavirus may have already politicized the matter. This tells us that this is a political and an intelligence story not a story mostly about science, Kavanagh said. And so we should understand the picture in that sense, and not be naive about it. Were in a place where politics is driving peoples scientific understanding in a dangerous way.
