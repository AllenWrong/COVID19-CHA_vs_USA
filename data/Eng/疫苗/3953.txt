The head of the US General Services Administration formally designated Presidentelect Joe Biden on Monday as the apparent winner of the Nov  election, clearing the way for the start of the presidential transition.  Shortly after the letter from GSA head Emily Murphy to Biden was made public, Trump, who has refused to concede the election, tweeted We will keep up the good fight and I believe we will prevail! Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols and have told my team to do the same.  Murphys move allows the Biden transition team to coordinate with federal agencies, especially on critical national security and public health areas as the COVID pandemic sweeps across the nation.  The GSA will make . million available to Biden to begin the transition process, as well as additional funds to prepare his staff and appointees. The presidential inauguration will take place on Jan .  Murphy, who was appointed by Trump, faced bipartisan criticism for failing to begin the transition process sooner, preventing Bidens team from working with career agency officials on plans for his administration.  She wrote in a letter to Biden Please know that I came to my decision independently, based on the law and available facts. I was never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch officialincluding those who work at the White House or GSAwith regard to the substance or timing of my decision.  Murphy added that she received many threats amid the delay in what she called an effort to coerce me into making this determination prematurely, but she said they, too, had not influenced her decision.  She said she made the determination based on recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results.  Her letter came after Michigan certified the states  electoral votes to Biden on Monday.  Trump has refused to acknowledge the results of the election since Biden was first projected as the winner more than two weeks ago. His campaign launched more than a dozen lawsuits to overturn votes in key battleground states, but none has succeeded.  Yohannes Abraham, the executive director of the Biden transition, said in a statement that the decision is a needed step to begin tackling the challenges facing our nation, including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track.  Trump has faced mounting criticism from some members of his own party over his refusal to help the presidentelect make a smooth transition to the White House.  Retiring US Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, released a statement on Monday saying that Trump should put the country first and help Bidens administration succeed.  Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, called on Monday for Murphy to release money and staffing needed for the transition. Portman, a senior member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, also said Biden should receive highlevel briefings on national security and the coronavirus vaccinedistribution plan.  Another Republican, Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, also urged a smooth transition, saying in a statement on Monday that at some point, the  election must end.  Earlier on Monday, Biden announced several picks for top jobs in national security and foreign relations and reportedly is expected to nominate former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen as the first female treasury secretary. He named former secretary of state John Kerry as special presidential envoy for climate, Alejandro Mayorkas to head the Department of Homeland Security, the first immigrant in that position, and Avril D. Haines as director of national intelligence, the first woman in that position.  Meanwhile, amid speculation that Trump intends to run for the White House in , a new HillHarrisX poll found that  percent of registered voters in the Nov  survey said they supported the idea of another presidential run by Trump, and  percent were opposed.
