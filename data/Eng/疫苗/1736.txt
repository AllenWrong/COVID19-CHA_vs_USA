Innovation and global cooperation should play key roles in distributing COVID vaccines, addressing poverty and dealing with climate change, said technology guru Bill Gates at the fiveday Pujiang Innovation Forum which commenced on May .Gates, currently the cochair of the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, suggested via video conferencing that funding should be increased for initiatives like the COVID Vaccines Global Access COVAX which is distributing vaccines. Efforts should be made to increase the number of qualified vaccines in the portfolio and ramp up manufacturing and supply around the world.I hope to see COVID vaccine supplied from China increase and play a significant global role, he said.As Gates explained, more inclusive innovation is needed.Innovation that doesnt stop at the RD stage or cater only to those who can afford it. Innovation that reaches people trapped on the wrong side of entrenched inequities and gives everyone a chance to lead a healthy, productive life, he said.The goal mentioned above is the reason the Gates Foundation was established more than  years ago. Since then, the foundation has worked with a huge number of partners around the world to make a difference, including many successful partnerships in China.On the other hand, Gates said that with Chinas leadership on inclusive innovation, progress can be made regarding lessening the poverty and food insecurity, and accelerating progress toward the sustainable development goals.While the world is still working to end COVID, it faces another potential global calamity around the corner in climate change, said Gates. Again, Chinas dedication to inclusive innovation can help lead the way to a netzeroemissions future, he said.We have learned a lot through our many partnerships over the years and have been impressed by the hard work and inclusive vision of so many Chinese innovators and institutions, said Gates.We have also found that the best way forward in any endeavor is by building broad, diverse partnerships to address a shared challenge. As an international philanthropic organization, our foundation is uniquely positioned to help create these necessary coalitions, he added.
