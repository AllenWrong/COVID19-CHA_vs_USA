Pharmaceutical ingredients from afar help Brazil as it battles to control COVID

Brazil, which has the secondhighest COVID death toll in the world, is ramping up its fight against the novel coronavirus with Chinas active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, to make vaccines.The supply of the APIs is of great relevance, said Henrique de Moura Reis, international relations manager at the China Trade Center Group, an organization that seeks to promote trade and other ties between China and Brazil. With that shipment of supplies, the Brazilian government will be able to guarantee production of more than  million doses for the countrys national vaccination campaign.The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a publicly funded biomedical institute commonly known as Fiocruz, has secured enough APIs made in China to resume production of tens of millions of doses of AstraZenecas Vaxzevria vaccine this year.Fiocruz, based in Rio de Janeiro, said the shipments earlier this year would ensure enough raw materials for  million doses of vaccines, bringing its total production this year to about  million doses.We are currently seeing a revolution in the field of vaccines, with fast responses and the satisfaction of having this production in Brazil already, said Marco Krieger, vicepresident for production and innovation at Fiocruz.With the virus continuing to spread, there are high expectations that the new supplies of raw materials from China will help boost production of vaccines and speed up jabs.About  kilometers away, the Butantan Institute, another public institution, makes CoronaVac vaccines developed by Sinovac Biotech with supplies of APIs from China. Butantan gets the raw materials from China and then finishes and packages the vaccines at its facilities in Sao Paulo.Brazil aims to eventually produce its own APIs to make COVID injections developed by both Sinovac and AstraZeneca, but for the time being it is reliant on China for its supply of active vaccine ingredients.National driveThe Butantan Institute was forced to halt production on June  after it delivered  million doses to the national vaccination program and exhausted , liters of APIs received on May .A new shipment of , liters of APIs arrived in Brazil last month, allowing for the production of another  million doses, Butantan said. Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria preemptively celebrated the shipment of raw materials by tweeting that there will be more vaccines for Brazilians arms.Securing the supply of Chinese APIs to continue with the production of AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccines in Brazil required a coordinated diplomatic strategy between Brasilia and Beijing, an effort in which Chinas Ambassador Yang Wanming has played a key role. China and Brazil are committed to fighting the pandemic together and that will continue to strengthen ties, Yang said.Chinas Wuxi Biologics makes the APIs necessary to manufacture AstraZenecas COVID vaccine.By Friday, Brazils COVID case tally stood at more than . million, the thirdhighest in the world after the United States and India, and the death count exceeded ,, next only to the US, according to the World Health Organization.Using the Chinese APIs, the BioManguinhos facility of Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro has the capacity to make up to  million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines a month, and the Butantan Institute has delivered more than  million doses of CoronaVac vaccines to the national immunization campaign against COVID, since its production began in December.Brazil is expanding its portfolio of vaccines against the coronavirus and is forging a deal with CanSino Biologics of China to source  million doses of Convidecia, a vaccine against SARSCoV that requires only one shot to create immunity.According to officials, CanSinos vaccines will start arriving in the third quarter of the year. Anvisa, the Brazilian healthcare regulator, is now reviewing a request for emergency approval of CanSinos vaccine in Brazil.The writer is a freelance journalist for China Daily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
