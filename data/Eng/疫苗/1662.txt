World Bank revises annual forecast upward, citing stronger foreign demand for exports                     Chinas economic growth is expected to accelerate to . percent this year, faster than projected in January, supported by buoyant exports and the release of pentup demand amid effective control of the COVID outbreak, the World Bank said in a report on Tuesday.  In addition to China, the strong rebounds from a few major economies, including the United States, whose growth is projected at . percent, will propel the global economy to expand . percent this year, the fastest postrecession pace in  years, according to the Global Economic Prospects report.  Commenting on Chinas projected . percent growth, Ayhan Kose, director of the World Banks Prospects Group, said that given the size of the economy, thats quite an impressive number.  That growth rate represents an upward revision of . percentage point from the World Banks January projections, which it attributes largely to expectations of stronger foreign demand.  The International Monetary Fund predicted in early April that Chinas economy will grow at . percent this year. percentage point stronger than its January forecast.  The World Bank noted in its analysis that COVID infections remain low in China, and the recovery has expanded from public investment to consumption.  It said Chinas goods export growth has been strong, and goods import growth has accelerated, helped by recovering domestic demand.  Chinese customs data released on Monday showed that the nations total imports and exports in the first five months of the year increased  percent yearonyear, reflecting upward momentum in trade amid steady economic operations and external demand.  The authorities have recently started to shift policy efforts away from supporting activity and toward addressing financial stability risks by reducing net liquidity provision, the World Bank said.  It predicts that Chinas growth will moderate to . percent next year, reflecting diminishing fiscal and monetary support and tighter property and macroprudential regulations. Macroprudential financial policies aim to ensure the stability of the financial system as a whole to prevent substantial disruptions in credit and other vital financial services.  As China is the only country in East Asia and the Pacific region whose output has surpassed prepandemic levels, how it fares will have a bearing on the regions development picture.  On the whole, growth in East Asia and the Pacific is projected to rise to . percent in , largely reflecting a strong rebound in China. Nevertheless, output in twothirds of the countries in the region will remain below prepandemic levels until next year, according to the World Bank.  The regional recovery is expected to moderate next year, the global lender said.  In an online interview, Kose, of the World Bank, said I talked about growth in emerging market economies around  percent. That number looks pretty strong. But if you take out China, the number goes down to close to  percent, and for lowincome countries, the growth number is going to be less than  percent.  However, the World Bank cautioned that following this years cyclical rebound, Chinas economy is projected to slow over the medium term, reflecting excessive borrowing as well as structural trends, including a declining labor supply and softening productivity growth.  To bolster potential growth, China needs to pursue structural reforms that boost marketbased resource allocation toward more productive activities, it said.  Globally, recovery is strong but uneven, with many emerging markets and developing economies continuing to struggle with the COVID pandemic and its aftermath, the World Bank said in a news release.  The projected . percent growth rate for the US would be the fastest pace since the mids, according to the release.  Global output will be about  percent below prepandemic projections by the end of this year, and per capita income losses will not be reversed by  for about twothirds of emerging market and developing economies, according to the World Bank report.  While there are welcome signs of global recovery, the pandemic continues to inflict poverty and inequality on people in developing countries around the world, said World Bank Group President David Malpass.  First and foremost, expanding vaccine distribution and deployment, especially to developing countries, is a precondition for economic recovery, Malpass said.  Globally coordinated efforts are essential to accelerate vaccine distribution and debt relief, particularly for lowincome countries. As the health crisis eases, policymakers will need to address the pandemics lasting effects and take steps to spur green, resilient and inclusive growth while safeguarding macroeconomic stability, he said.  huanxinzhaochinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
