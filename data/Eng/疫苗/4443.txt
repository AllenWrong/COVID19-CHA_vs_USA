It is the second clinical trial announced by the NIH this week in an effort to step up treatment for COVID. Participants must have laboratoryconfirmed SARSCoV infection with evidence of lung involvement, including a need for supplemental oxygen, abnormal chest Xrays, or illness requiring mechanical ventilation. People with confirmed infection who have mild symptoms or no apparent symptoms will not be included in the study, said the NIH. They are being randomly assigned in a to ratio to receive either subcutaneous interferon betaa plus remdesivir combination therapy or remdesivir alone. Neither the participants nor the study team will know who is receiving which treatment regimen. All participants will receive standard doses of remdesivir and either interferon betaa or a placebo. Those in the combination therapy group will receive interferon betaa as a microgram subcutaneous injection every other day for a total of four doses during hospitalization. Those in the remdesivironly group will receive a matching placebo subcutaneous injection every other day for a total of four doses during hospitalization. Investigators will evaluate whether time to recovery is shorter in the combination therapy group relative to the remdesivironly group, said the NIH.
