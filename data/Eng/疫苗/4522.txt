PhotoAgencies    Russian medical researchers have claimed the lead in the race to develop a vaccine for COVID. Media reports say that two vaccine candidates have completed the second phase of trialsthe last of which were on humansand will be made available, initially, to a limited number of people who step forward for injections next month. While the reports refer to the vaccines as having completed all trials, a leading researcher behind the project said their limited public distributionslated for Aug is the equivalent of a phase III trial. Three entities, including two Chinese companies, have entered phase III trialsor the final stage of human testingfor their vaccines, Reuters earlier reported. In Russia, the two vaccines have been developed by the Gamaleya National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow. The Moscow center was given the goahead from authorities for the latest round of clinical trials that began on June . With the trials completed, Alexander Gintsburg, the director of the Gamaleya research center, said a small amount of the vaccines will be made available to ordinary Russians over Aug likening this development, with the followup monitoring, to a phase III trial. The first vaccine, in the form of a solution for intramuscular administration, was put through trials at the Burdenko Military Hospital. At the same time, the second candidate vaccinein the form of a powder prepared as a solution for intramuscular administration, was given to  volunteers at Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University. Gintsburg said the administration of doses to those who come forward next month would proceed under strict supervision. Early results from the first smallscale human trial of the vaccines developed by the Gamaleya research center had shown them to be safe, according to a report by the RIA news agency on Sunday.

CHINA DAILY    Treatment might be free Its envisaged that the vaccines will be provided to the public in designated medical institutions and, possibly for free, with the expense borne by the government. Private companies would begin mass production of the vaccines by September, Gintsburg said of the envisaged timeline. In the human trials at the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University that began last month, nine of the  volunteers received one dose of vaccine, and the other half were given the prospective booster dose to test. The research has been completed and it proved that the vaccine is safe, said Yelena Smolyarchuk, the head of Sechenov Universitys clinical research center. Each group of the volunteers will be discharged from the Sechenov University facility, on Wednesday and next Monday, after spending  days in isolation to guard against exposure to other infections. The volunteers, aged  to , will be monitored for a further six months after their release. Data currently available... shows the volunteers have developed an immune response to the coronavirus vaccine, the Russian Defense Ministry, which is involved in the trials, said on Monday. It added that a further  volunteers were administered one of the vaccines at a military hospital on June . The decision to involve the general public in vaccine trials underscores Russias desire to move ahead fast with its testing of the soughtafter coronavirus vaccine, said the Moscow Times.
