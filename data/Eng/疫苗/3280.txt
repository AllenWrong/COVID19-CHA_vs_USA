NEW YORKMajor League Baseball has proposed a onemonth delay in starting spring training due to the coronavirus pandemic and pushing back opening day to April , two people familiar with the plan told Associated Press.Under the plan presented to the players union on Friday, the regular season would be cut from  games to .Also, the playoffs would be expanded from  teams to , the designated hitter would extend to the National League for the second straight season and MLB would keep the experimental rules for seveninning doubleheaders and beginning extra innings with a runner on second base.All players would report for spring training on March , back from the current calendar that calls a voluntary reporting date of Feb  for pitchers, catchers and injured players, and Feb  for others.Opening day would be pushed back  days from its currently scheduled April  date and the regular season would end Oct  instead of Oct . The postseason would extend into November.Sources familiar with the plan spoke on condition of anonymity Sunday because no announcements were made. The sides have not discussed the proposal with each other since MLB made it.A day before the plan was presented, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said he would like to know by his regular Monday call with owners if the union had interest in delaying the start of spring training.The reasoning behind the delay would be to gain time for more vaccinations and better assess the health situation.Seven teams in each league would make the playoffs, and only the division winner with the best record would receive a bye in the bestofthree first round. There would be a selection show in which the seeded teams would be able to, in order of percentage, select their firstround opponent. The three advancing teams in each league and the one with a bye would advance to the bestoffive Division Series, starting the traditional rounds of the postseason.While the plan says players would receive  percent of their salaries if all  scheduled games are played, Manfred would have an expanded right to stop spring training, the regular season or the postseason under certain conditions.Those would be if government restrictions prevent five or more teams from playing home games even without fans, if government rules restrict travel in the United States, if Manfred determines after consultation with medical experts and the union there is an unreasonable safety risk to players or staff or if the number of regular majorleaguers unavailable because of COVID undermines completive integrity.Each team would start with  scheduled days off, and each would be allowed to be scheduled up to  split doubleheaders. Players are usually reluctant to split doubleheaders because of the lengthy day at the ballpark each entails.The regular season would be compressed to  games in  days from  games in  days.The World Series would be scheduled to end in the Nov  range, with the exact time depending on discussions with broadcast partners.As part of the plan, owners would guarantee a postseason players pool of  percent of the gate of the first two firstround games plus  million for the remainder of the postseason, matching the  pool.Players previously rejected a proposal teams made Jan  for expanded playoffs in exchange for extending the DH to the National League.Last season was cut from  games per team to , and the postseason was expanded to  teams and ended Oct  when the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Tampa Bay Rays in World Series Game .Players received nds of their salaries.No fans were allowed during the regular season last year, which because of the pandemic started July  rather than March . About , fans per game attended the NL Championship Series and World Series, both played at a neutral site in Arlington, Texas. In a deal for expanded team playoffs in , MLB guaranteed a postseason players pool of  million.AP
