Schutte and his colleague Megan Johnson from the United States visited a designated hospital for vaccination in the morning and received their second dose of the vaccine with the help of an interpreter. They completed their first dose in Xiamen, Fujian, in late May, as arranged by their employer, a foreign company in Jinjiang. I didnt have any adverse reaction after the first dose either, Schutte said. In June, Jinjiang kicked off citywide vaccinations for all foreigners, so they dont have to travel to get them. Chen Yuying, who is in charge of the COVID vaccination effort in the hospital, said they were the th and th foreigners to be vaccinated there. Johnson said the whole process was smooth and the medics were kind. She added that she felt safer while traveling after being inoculated.
