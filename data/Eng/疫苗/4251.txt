The US death toll from COVID neared , on Tuesday, accounting for onefifth of the global casualties from the pandemic, as experts warned of further increases in infections and mortality as cooler fall weather moves people indoors.  As of Tuesday morning, , people in the US had died from COVID, with more than . million infected with the novel coronavirus, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, which registered a global death toll of ,.  That means the US toll has nearly doubled in four monthsin late May the country reported , deaths from the disease.  These are not numbers these are human beings. These are friends and family, Ali H. Mokdad, chief strategy officer of the Population Health Initiative at the University of Washington, told China Daily.  Im concerned that were coming into fall and winter where well have more infection and well have much more mortality, unfortunately, he said in a video interview.  On Monday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention withdrew guidance that had said airborne transmission was thought to be the main way the coronavirus spreads. It said the draft recommendation was posted in error on Friday.  Commenting on the sudden reversal, Mokdad said it was confusing and that people may lose trust if the messaging is not consistent and changes are made without explanations.  Potentially there will be another , deaths between now and January, so we have to be very careful, since we are moving indoors, because cold weather is coming, he said. Its better to make sure that we are on the conservative side with our recommendations in that regard.  In its update to global COVID mortality projections last week, the University of Washingtons Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicted that cumulative deaths by Jan  would hit ,.  The institute cited steeper than expected declines in several states as the factors for lowering an estimate of , deaths by years end that it had predicted on Sept . But it cautioned that deaths could surge to more than , per day by the end of December.  So far we have been underestimating by a little bit the mortality for several reasons. We assumed that when a state reaches eight deaths per day per million, they will go to a lockdown, Mokdad said. Unfortunately, we underestimate because we assume that states will do something, and states sometimes dont do that.  The institute said that increasing mask use to  percent could save nearly , lives, reducing the expected number of deaths by . percent.  Mokdad, a University of Washington professor of health metrics, said that in the US, every state decided to do something different.  CDC China had a very consistent message and told people exactly what they need to do. Sometimes when people didnt wear a mask, there was enforcement, he said. We know in the United States when you recommend something and you dont enforce it, sometimes it doesnt work.  He said that the US could have done better by locking down earlier and making sure we stay locked down until we control the virus, then open up.  US President Donald Trump, who admitted to a journalist that he had played down the risk of the virus early on because he did not want to create a panic, continued to say the US would soon see a light at the end of the tunnel.  We are rounding the corner on the pandemic, with or without a vaccine, Trump said on Monday.  huanxinzhaochinadailyusa.com         Maria Flores kisses her son Pedro Garcia, , while a teacher takes his hand as he arrives for the first day of school at the Mosaic PreK Center in the New York City borough of Queens on Monday.
