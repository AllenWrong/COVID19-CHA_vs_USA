The AsiaPacific region cannot and should not relapse into the confrontation and division of the Cold War era, President Xi Jinping said on Thursday, as he urged greater regional cooperation on pandemic recovery and the climate crisis. We should be forwardlooking, move ahead and reject practices of discrimination and exclusion of others. Attempts to draw ideological lines or form small circles on geopolitical grounds are bound to fail, Xi said in a prerecorded keynote speech to the annual AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit. The summit brought together the worlds most influential business leaders as well as leaders of APEC economies. Xi is also scheduled to participate in the APEC Economic Leaders Meeting with other Pacific Rim leaders, including US President Joe Biden, on Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
