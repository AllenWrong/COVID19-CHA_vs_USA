Govt uses emergency powers to get vaccines faster to public after procuring .m doses                                  Hong Kong to date has secured . million doses of coronavirus vaccines, more than enough to immunize everyone in the city, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuetngor announced on Wednesday. Lam also said the government is still seeking a fourth manufacturer in a bid to have twice the number of vaccine doses needed to inoculate the citys . million population. Two shots are necessary to give a person immunity to COVID. In addition to the  million vaccine doses the government secured earlier from two sources  mainlandbased Sinovac Biotech, and Germanybased BioNTech  the government obtained a batch of . million doses of the coronavirus vaccine developed jointly by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, Lam said. The Hong Kong leaders announcement came after a special Executive Council meeting at which the council approved legislation empowering the citys health chief to greenlight emergency use of vaccines for inoculation programs to avoid lengthy drug registration procedures. Lam said that under the programs, Hong Kong people will be able to choose their vaccine by deciding when and where to get injected according to the vaccines availability. We dont anticipate that there will be more than one type of vaccine available at the same time at a certain place for people to choose. But residents will know which vaccine is to be injected when entering an injection center and then decide whether to be vaccinated right there, Lam said. The government is also planning to set up an indemnity fund to provide financial aid for those who suffer serious side effects from the shots. In addition, the Executive Council approved amendments to regulations to allow a mandatory quarantine of up to four weeks for inbound travelers, up from the  days currently required. Beginning today, returnees from the United Kingdom will be required to be isolated at designated hotels for three weeks, in light of the morecontagious coronavirus variant that has surfaced there. All flights from the UK to the city have already been banned. However, the mutated virus reported in the UK may have already landed in Hong Kong, as two students returning from the country earlier this month were found to have contracted the strain after a preliminary laboratory analysis of  UKimported patients samples. One of the students is a yearold boy who flew back with three others on Dec  and is still hospitalized the other is a yearold boy who returned on Dec  alone and was discharged from a hospital after treatment, said Chuang Shukkwan of the Centre for Health Protection at the daily COVID briefing. Although the  new cases on Wednesday marked the lowest daily caseload since Nov , there were  unlinked infections among the  local cases. There were  untraceable ones on Tuesday. The percentage of untraced local cases remains high. Each of such cases can lead to cluster infections or even outbreaks. People should be vigilant, Chuang said. The citys total of confirmed infections was pushed to ,, while more than  preliminarily positive cases were also recorded on Wednesday and awaited confirmation. A yearold man who had chronic diseases and died on Wednesday afternoon was the citys rd coronavirusrelated fatality. jefferyguchinadailyhk.com                                                                                !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
