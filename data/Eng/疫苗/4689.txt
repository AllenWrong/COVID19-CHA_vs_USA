PhotoAgencies    WASHINGTON  Bypassing clinical trials of a potential vaccine for SARSCoV, the virus causing COVID, would be catastrophic, said an editorial published on Science Advances on Friday. It is vital to take time to ensure any vaccine candidates safety and investigate potential adverse effects, said the editorial by Douglas Green, deputy editor of the multidisciplinary scientific journal. A vaccine able to trigger strong neutralizing antibody responses in clinical tests will still not be ready for widespread implementation without comprehensive safety tests, wrote Green, who is also an expert on immunology. Vaccines must be examined for causing an effect known as antibodydependent enhancement, whereby vaccineinduced antibodies that bind to the virus also attach to the bodys cells, facilitating infection of these cells  a concerning phenomenon that has been observed in vaccines against dengue, Ebola, HIV, and feline coronavirus, said the editorial. Ethical accelerated testing on humans should not be ruled out completely, but extreme risks must be weighed against potential benefits, it said. There are currently  vaccines under development against SARSCoV, with most expected to clear phase one, and two already moving into phase two trials, it added.
