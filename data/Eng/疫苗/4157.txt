COVAX represents the largest portfolio of potential COVID vaccines and the most effective way to share safe and effective vaccines equitably across the world, WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a virtual press conference. Equitably sharing vaccines is the fastest way to safeguard highrisk communities, stabilize health systems and drive a truly global economic recovery, he added. As one of the leading countries in vaccine development, China has officially joined COVAX, a move described by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson as an important step to uphold the concept of a shared community of health for all and to honor its commitment to turning COVID vaccines into a global public good. At Mondays virtual press conference, Tedros also mentioned the worrying phase that the COVID pandemic has entered. With the coming of winter in the northern hemisphere and sharp acceleration in the number of new COVID cases, Tedros warned that the next few months will be tough, particularly in Europe and North America.
