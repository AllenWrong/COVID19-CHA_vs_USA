Hong Kong will emerge from crisis stronger, prepared for future

Two of my colleagues and I went out for dinner last Thursday after work. We went to a restaurant in Causeway Bay for spicy chicken pot. The restaurant is on the third floor of a very old building, and I was so relieved to see that it is still open and doing quite well after all the social distancing rules that were implemented for a year. Ive always considering the spicy chicken pot my soul food in Hong Kong, as it reminds me of the dish I used to have when I was growing up in the cold, northeast province of Jilin, where people would just put all the ingredients, vegetables, meat, into an iron pot that requires constant heating when serving it to people.       I was also glad to see that this restaurant is using some new tricks, like mobile phone ordering The guests now can using their smartphone to scan a QR code to place orders instead of using a pencil to fill in little boxes on a piece of paper like pupils doing some tests in school. Right after  pm, the restaurant was full of people, four people per table, as required by the SAR government, but no empty table in the room. I was just so glad that one of the favorite restaurants in the city made it through the tough situation during the yearlong fight against the COVID pandemic. What doesnt kill you makes you stronger  we always say that, although I dont believe any of it I had to think what I am getting out of the pandemic and where Im heading after its over. By the way, I have already made my appointment to take the COVID vaccine, so yes, the pandemic will be at least over for me very soon. During the past year or so, like the spicy chicken pot restaurant, I have also picked up a few new tricks. Ive started running. I could never run in my whole life up until now. Due to the onandoff social distancing rules implemented, there has been not much entertainment I could have, so I ran after work for  kilometers every other day. I also got some flowers in my home, assembled a new desk by myself and read a lot more books. I think just like me, Hong Kong has also been quietly changing, or preparing for the voyage beyond the pandemic. I remember that my colleagues and I have interviewed numerous industry experts and scholars to talk about why ecommerce and epayments were far less popular in Hong Kong than on the Chinese mainland, and we talked about what the SAR government should do to facilitate the development of ecommerce in the city. But look now. Against the backdrop of the pandemic, ecommerce and epayments are taking off here. Traditional retail giants like jewelry and cosmetic chain stores are now devoted to selling their products online. Hong Kong people love to dine out and it was very convenient to do so thats why when food delivery platforms launched a few years ago in the city, it almost looked like a joke, but now, the food delivery business in the city is booming and has generated a lot of jobs, and one of the major platforms, Deliveroo, is seeking to be listed in London. Hong Kong, as an exhibition center, used to host so many exhibitions, sourcing events, and it is still doing that, but in a hybrid way  the physicalvirtual combination, and the experts are all saying that this hybrid form of events will be here for good, even after the pandemic is over. So things have been changing during the past year, and change may not be a bad thing, as Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mopo has expected that the citys econmy will see a strong rebound in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the th FiveYear Plan , which sets out the nations vision for social and economic development over the next halfdecade, approved by the National Peoples Congress, has made Hong Kong more relevant than ever to the worlds secondlargest economy. The SARs future has never been more secure, with the National Security Law for Hong Kong, its electoral revamp and a bigger role in the nations development, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kinchung, told China Daily during an interview. So, if we look at things this way, with a more positive attitude, we dont need to consider the past year as a lost year, but a year of changing, a year of restructuring and preparing, so that we can embrace any opportunities lying ahead of us. When the world eventually returns to its normality, it will see a new and a better Hong Kong. I have no doubt about that. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
