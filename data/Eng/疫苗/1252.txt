Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks when commenting on the DPP authoritys response to a recent vaccine deal between a mainland company and Taiwan enterprises. According to officials with the DPP authority, the deal was a result of the efforts from the German government and two Taiwan enterprises. They claimed that the mainland stopped vaccine blocking due to pressures from the vaccine aid of the United States and Japan. Zhu said the mainland has expressed its willingness to try its best to help Taiwan compatriots cope with the epidemic since the outbreak on the island in May. She noted that the Shanghaibased Fosun Pharma, Taiwans only source of BioNTech COVID vaccine, has long made clear its willingness to provide vaccines to Taiwan compatriots. The DPP authoritys political calculation and manipulation are the fundamental reason behind Taiwans vaccine shortage and loss of innocent lives to the epidemic, Zhu noted. Negotiations on vaccine purchases between two Taiwan enterprises and Fosun were not approved by the DPP authority until late June when the epidemic deteriorated on the island, she said. The fact is clear to the Taiwan public and cannot be changed, no matter how the DPP authority attempts to shift its responsibility, she added. Reiterating the mainlands willingness to aid Taiwan compatriots in fighting the epidemic, Zhu advised the DPP authority to stop putting its political interests above the lives and health of Taiwan compatriots.
