Research that journals rejected ended up helping to solve coronavirus puzzle                                            When Wang Nianshuang first found a way to stabilize the shapeshifting spike protein of a coronavirus in  the then postdoctoral researcher and his collaborators had a hard time finding a journal willing to publish the results.The paper was rejected by five top scientific journals, and when it was finally published, one year had already passed, Wang, , told China Daily recently from his home in New Haven, Connecticut.However, that rejected research became a key component in engineering effective COVID vaccines produced by the US biotech firm Moderna and the US pharmaceuticals company Pfizer and its German development partner BioNTech. The technology is also being used by Johnson Johnson, Novavax, CureVac and Translare Bio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
