We reiterate our commitment to bring the pandemic under control everywhere as soon as possible, put people at the center of preparedness and to strengthen our collective efforts to prepare for, prevent, detect, report, and respond to health emergencies, the G ministers said in a final communique. Boosting efforts to strengthen the ongoing coordination between finance and health ministers of the G is crucial, they said. The task force will enhance the collaboration and global cooperation on issues relating to pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, thus leaving the international community better prepared in the eventual case of future health threats outbreaks, they added. The G ministers also reacted to the appeal made by the World Health Organization WHO earlier this month for the international community, especially advanced economies, to ensure necessary funding for the COVID vaccination campaign at global level. The WHO has set two targets, namely to vaccinate at least  percent of the planets population by the end of this year and  percent by mid. To help reach the goals, the G ministers pledged to take steps to help boost the supply of vaccines and essential medical products and inputs in developing countries and remove relevant supply and financing constraints.
