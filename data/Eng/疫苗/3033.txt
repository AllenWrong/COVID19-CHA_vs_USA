Funds irrelevant if there are no vaccines to buy

The head of the World Health Organization has urged richer countries on Monday to check before ordering additional COVID vaccine shots for themselves, so as not to undermine efforts to get vaccine shots to poorer countries through the United Nationsled COVAX program. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, directorgeneral of the WHO, said some highincome countries are entering contracts with vaccine manufacturers that undermine the deals COVAX has in place, and reduce the number of doses it can buy. COVAX supports a global equitable sharing of COVID vaccines, and to ensure poorer countries do not miss out on available doses. The first wave of vaccines under COVAX is expected to be shipped out between late February and the end of June, with some  participating economies set to receive . million doses. On Friday, leaders from the G countries cited a collective . billion in new funding to UNbacked efforts to support affordable and equitable access to vaccines and treatments for COVID. The WHO chief thanked them for the contributions, but warned that money is not the only challenge that it faces. If there are no vaccines to buy, money is irrelevant, said Ghebreyesus during a WHO press briefing on Monday. We can only have vaccines delivered to the countries who are members of COVAX if highincome countries cooperate in respecting the deals that COVAX did. He pointed out that it is in the interest of all countries, including wealthy nations, to ensure that health workers, older people and other atrisk groups are first in line for vaccines globally. To achieve this, we need more funding, we need countries to share doses immediately, we need manufacturers to prioritize contracts with COVAX, and we also need a significant increase in the production of vaccines, he said. The ONE Campaign, an organization cofounded by U singer Bono, said last week that G members, the European Union and Australia had collectively bought nearly . billion more vaccine doses than they needed to inoculate every member of their populations. boleungmail.chinadailyuk.com         Citizens inoculated with Sinovac COVID vaccines sit in an observation area at a vaccination site in Ecatepec, Mexico, on Monday.
