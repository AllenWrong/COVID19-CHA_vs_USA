Chen Siyuan, president of Bristol Myers Squibb, China A This is our third year at the CIIE, and this year we are proudly bringing more of our breakthrough innovations and new strategic partnerships to show the world how the patientcentric innovation that is embedded into the DNA of BMS can help Chinese patients fight against serious diseases, and help China achieve the goals of its Healthy China vision. China is a strategic and important market for BMS. The CIIE provides us with an excellent platform to grasp vast and promising collaboration opportunities. A China is an important engine of the global economy and we see the critical role China will play in helping the global economy recover from the impact of COVID. We have seen in the past years the positive spillover effects produced by the CIIE through promoting the economic development of China and the world. This year, for the very first time, the Biomedicine Subsection gathered global innovations while also driving focus on more collaborations for open innovation. And the establishment of the Biomedical Committee will create more spillover effects and dynamic momentum to the global biomedical innovation. A China is driving global economic recovery by its effort of increasing imports. Take the healthcare industry as an example. China is accelerating the review and approval process for global innovative medicines in recent years, which not only benefits Chinese patients but also provides new impetus for the development and innovation of the global healthcare industry. BMS is making a longterm commitment to healthcare and innovation in China as a key growth driver for BMS. In the next five years, our goal is to introduce in China up to  innovative medicines and indications from our diverse therapeutic areas. A China has become a vibrant player in the rapidly growing biomedical industry in the world. In particular, with the guidance of the dualcirculation strategy, Chinas biomedical industry will play a critical role in collaboration for open innovation, and in contribution to the achievement of the Healthy China  plan and the th FiveYear Plan . China has also already become one of the top players globally in contributing to pharmaceutical innovation. BMS is committed to working with the government to foster innovation and economic growth. A There is no doubt that China has been continuously improving its business environment that encourages open innovation and collaborations. In the healthcare industry, China has made significant progress in the last several years, expanding access to innovative medicines for its people, reforming its healthcare system and elevating its regulations to international standard. Leveraging on this, BMS has accelerated introduction of its innovative medicines to benefit patients in China.  Mike Zhang, head of Sanofi Pasteur Greater China A Sanofi Pasteur is participating in CIIE for the fourth consecutive year. Through our participation, we hope to quickly introduce innovative vaccines and disease prevention solutions to benefit the Chinese people. We also look forward to working with partners across sectors to empower local vaccine innovation and support the public health system, helping better combat emerging infectious diseases and safeguard public health. At this years CIIE, we are demonstrating our New Health Formula for vaccine innovation. A Of course. The huge spillover effect we have seen in previous years CIIE has led to more engagement and partnerships in cuttingedge new technologies, products and solutions, as well as crossregional economic and trade collaboration. We can expect similar results this year to bolster economies and industries impacted by the COVID pandemic. This years CIIE also highlights how China is making every effort to not only power its own growth, but also contribute positively to the revival of the world economy. A COVID has had an immeasurable impact on the world economy. As the worlds secondlargest economy, China, with a population of . billion, has largely emerged from the pandemic. Chinas efforts to boost imports will undoubtedly be a key driver for the recovery and development of the world economy, while continuing to play an important role in ensuring the stability and growth of the global economy. A As the worlds No  vaccine market, China is one of Sanofi Pasteurs key global markets. As the Chinese people place increasing value in disease prevention, while enjoying rising spending power and quality of life, they desire betterquality vaccines and health protection solutions. The pandemic has also starkly highlighted the importance of vaccines among both government and the general public. These trends are further bolstering the entire vaccine industry, encouraging vaccine makers to develop innovative and highquality vaccines to meet peoples needs. A In recent years, weve seen the governments determination to open up at a higher level, further encourage innovation and create a businessfriendly environment. As the first multinational vaccine company to enter China and establish a worldleading local vaccine production site, Sanofi Pasteur has been encouraged and inspired by these efforts and is more confident about its business growth in China. We will continue to improve the availability of innovative vaccines, and spare no effort to make new contributions to preventive health and immunization in China. We also hope that China will continue to improve the priority review system for innovative vaccines, aligning with global practices in vaccine research and development, production and management.  Gloria Xu, vicepresident of DowGreater China A Dow is proud to have been a participant at the China International Import Expo in its inaugural year in , and we remain a stalwart and dedicated contributor. For our company, CIIE is a critical component of our annual plan, and we continue to expand the engagement. We increased the size of our booth from the  square meters in the first year to  square meters in  and . And we have already signed up for the  CIIE. A The CIIE has clearly become a critical component of industry engagement and innovation, evidenced by the increasing number of companies attending, increases in exhibition space and longwaiting lists for future sponsors. CIIE is a tangible example of the growth of the Chinese market, and expansion of Chinese production contributing over  percent to the worlds annual growth. CIIE brings together industries to demonstrate the value of collaboration, promote innovation and demonstrate future market opportunities and growth. A The increasing imports in China are the result of two strong forces working in parallelthe openness of the China market to support global value chains and upgrading domestic consumption propelled by more consumer preferences for ecofriendly, high quality products. China has been able to preserve the supply chain and consumer power despite the COVID pandemic, which will now be a critical contribution to restoring more global economic recovery and growth. A China represents a significant opportunity for the chemical industry, both to source and partner in the largest global manufacturing market, but also to drive innovation and growth in circular economy value chains, to support the national drive for more sustainable production. Dow has been in China for many decades and we are constantly looking at how we can continue to make ourselves essential as the economy and societal expectations in China evolve over time. We do see urbanization continuing and the megatransformation of China into a lowcarbon society picking up speed in the coming decades, which require a materials company like Dow to strengthen our local capability of tailored innovation, market insight and customer intimacy. A In the industrial segments where Dow operates, market access has been fully liberalized. There has been much more clarity and predictability in environmental, commercial and industrial regulations. We have also had positive experiences with IPR protection. As the Chinese economy becomes more sophisticated and technology advances, we do expect the regulatory environment to change constantly. We would appreciate opportunities to have an ongoing dialogue with Chinese government agencies to share technical knowledge in order to support the most constructive enabling policy for new topics and concerns.  Leon Wang, executive vicepresident of AstraZeneca A AZ has participated in the CIIE for four consecutive years. The CIIE is an important window for Chinas openingup. We value the CIIE as a unique stage both to demonstrate our innovation and to forge new cooperation with more partners. This year, our focus is to demonstrate a crossfield collaborative ecosystem that we have built with our partners from government, industry, academia, hospitals, investment, etc as well as relevant innovative results. A To host the CIIE as planned despite the impact of the COVID pandemic not only signifies Chinas determination to further open up, but also shows its sincere will to share the benefits and opportunities of Chinas fast development momentum with the entire world. Using this event as a window to boost international trade and cooperation, China, which is now the powerhouse of todays global economy, can help accelerate recovery of the world from the devastation brought by the pandemic over the past two years. A China has shown significant resilience and reported positive growth amid the pandemic. That is a contribution to the worlds recovery because China is the worlds most important growth engine and the largest manufacturing base. With such a huge market, Chinas move to increase imports besides exporting is critical for the whole world, especially for countries that are more export reliant and are in urgent need of orders from international markets to help boost economic recovery and ensure the livelihoods of their people. A As China increasingly integrates with the outside world and stresses innovation more than ever, the prospects of our industry in China are very bright. For example, AZ has recently upgraded our RD facility in Shanghai into our global RD China Center, which helps China gain a more significant position in the global medical innovation landscape. The prospects for Chinas consumer market are also very promising as Chinese peoples livelihoods will be further improved along with the economy, and they are seeing health as a very important investment and are willing to spend. A Absolutely yes. Since AZ entered the China market in , weve witnessed and benefited tremendously from Chinas improved business environment. And I can see that Chinas determination to further open up is unyielding. That is proved by various measures and policies carried out by the Chinese government, including the Belt and Road Initiative, the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership as well as hosting the CIIE. The world has benefited a lot from Chinas continuous openingup. In fact, China has been a key engine of the worlds economic growth over the past decades. Global companies like AZ, of course, are also some of the biggest beneficiaries of Chinas continuously openingup. AstraZeneca China has increasingly shown its strategic importance on the global map of AZ in terms of scientific RD, production and operation or commercial innovation.  Dan Brindle, president of Novartis Group China A This year is our fourth CIIE. Novartis was among the first group of multinational pharmaceutical companies to endorse and participate in the inaugural CIIE, and we have found it to be an important and unique platform to showcase our latest medicines and innovations, accelerate connections with the industry and explore partnerships within the industry and across industries. I am excited about the growing spillover effect of opportunities coming out of the CIIE and believe this will help further accelerate the introduction of innovative drugs to China, as well as help address the healthcare challenges by working with partners in the healthcare ecosystem. A Of course. The CIIE is a fantastic opportunity for China to continue to showcase the dynamic development that is taking place across China and across Chinas economy. Additionally, China further demonstrated its ability to manage COVID and maintain a steady economy and operate as close to normal as possible given the challenging circumstances. The CIIE should also be viewed through the lens of connecting stakeholders who collectively contribute to Chinas business environment and further facilitate international exchanges, all of which contribute to global trade. A It is difficult to comprehend the disruption that we have all felt throughout  and . COVID, as well as trade frictions and related issues, have added to the complexity and uncertainty around the world. It is important for countries to work together to bring about dialogue and cooperation so that the world can collectively emerge from the COVID period. I believe China is playing an important role in this regard, including supplying vaccines around the world, increasing imports and building a consumptioncentered economy. I think that this will have farreaching implications for the global economy in the years to come. A China is now the worlds second largest pharmaceutical market, and the largest market by volume. Given the huge unmet healthcare needs, accelerated regulatory reforms in drug reviews and approvals, and the increasingly proinnovation market environment, I am excited about the China market and believe it will be an increasingly promising market for innovationfocused companies like Novartis. At Novartis, we are working hard to bring innovative medicines and advanced therapies to the China market. China is one of our most strategic markets and we hope that it will become our second largest market globally by . A I started learning Mandarin Chinese in the mid s and have been lucky to spend a good majority of my life and career in China. Its been a privilege to have witnessed the tremendous changes in China over the past few decades. The government continues to demonstrate its strong commitment to further opening up Chinas economy and is doing this in a way that is inclusive to all stakeholders. I am confident that the business environment will continue to improve, and that this will encourage companies to continue to formulate longterm investment strategies in the country.  Zhao Yao, president of Omron Healthcare China A Omron has participated in the China International Import Expo for four consecutive years. It has been a great opportunity to exchange innovations and share insights with our partners and exhibitors. Through the expo, we hope to promote highquality development of the overall industry. At the same time, we also expect that the expo will exert a strong driving effect on our business in China and drive us to firmly take root in the Chinese market. A In the postpandemic era, how to promote global economic cooperation is a key subject. Therefore, the CIIE plays a role in gathering diversified industries such as healthcare, services trade, intelligent technology and consumer goods. It will be a great value embodiment creating economic value through linking and integrating different industrial chains. A The strong growth of Chinas economy and its further openingup undoubtedly help boost the recovery in the global economy and trade. The rapid growth of Chinas trade has produced a strong spillover effect on the world, and its continuously deepening reform and openingup policy will enable Chinas economy to maintain a longterm positive trend and thus make a contribution to global economic growth. A Consumer healthcare sector demand now tends to be diversified. In addition, Chinas Outline of the th FiveYear Plan  for National Economic and Social Development and the LongRange Objectives Through the Year  have put safeguarding peoples health in a strategic position. All these positive factors will promote the vigorous development of the healthcare industry, especially smart medical care in Chinas consumer market. Currently, the COVID pandemic is still rampant all over the world, the global economy has not yet fully recovered and unilateralism and protectionism are intensifying. In such a context, firm support for free trade and multilateralism will effectively facilitate regional economic recovery, drive global economic growth and promote fairness and winwin results. A We are very confident in it. In recent years, China has continuously deepened reforms in aspects like streamlined administrative procedures and improved services, and opened green channels for highquality imported products to increase support for market entities. In addition, the CIIE is held in an orderly and timely manner every year, which indicates that Chinas business environment will become more dynamic and creative. Since Chinas reform and openingup, the country has shifted from bringing in to going global. Various initiatives such as joining the World Trade Organization, putting forward the Belt and Road Initiative, setting up free trade zones and holding the CIIE have symbolized that Chinas openingup has reached an unprecedented level, and many valuable Chinese ideas and approaches have been introduced to the outside world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
