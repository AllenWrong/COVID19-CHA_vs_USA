A senior official of the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, believes Chinas recovery from the pandemic positions the country to strengthen efforts to rebalance the economy and deepen reforms. IMF First Deputy Managing Director Geoffrey W.S. Okamoto said on Thursday that, with Chinas economic recovery taking hold, it is a good time for policymakers to look more deeply at the fundamental drivers of growth. He was participating remotely in the Forum on National Affairs , an event hosted by the Counselors Office of the State Council of China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
