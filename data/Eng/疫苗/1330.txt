US steps up jabs push as Delta spreads
2021-07-08 00:00
US President Joe Biden announced new initiatives on Tuesday to get more people vaccinated as inoculation numbers continue to slow down across the country and the Delta variant spreads across the unvaccinated population. Biden said the highly transmissible Delta variant, which was first detected in India, is already responsible for half of all cases in many parts of the country. Millions of Americans are still unvaccinated and unprotected. And because of that, their communities are at risk. Their friends are at risk, the people they care about are at risk, Biden said. This is an even bigger concern because of the Delta variant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
