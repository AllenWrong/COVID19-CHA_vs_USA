WHA once again the stage for a farce
2021-05-12 00:00
After the G foreign ministers issued a communique voicing support for Taiwans meaningful participation in World Health Organization forums and the World Health Assembly on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken doubled down on the Taiwan card on Friday, calling for the World Health Organization to invite the island to participate as an observer at the meeting, reiterating his call again on Sunday. Instead of viewing the WHA as an opportunity to promote solidarity in the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic, it is being used by those who are illintentioned toward China as an excuse to engage in more troublemaking. As per United Nations General Assembly Resolution  and WHA Resolution ., the participation of the island in activities of international organizations, including the WHO, must be handled in accordance with the oneChina principle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
