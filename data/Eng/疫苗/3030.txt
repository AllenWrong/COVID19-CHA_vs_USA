As many African countries work to secure supplies of COVID vaccines, the importance of preparatory work for efficient distribution of the doses has been stressed.At a meeting of African health ministers hosted by the World Health Organization on Thursday, Matshidiso Moeti, the WHOs regional director for Africa, said more work needs to be done in setting up systems to manage the logistics and supply chain needs for getting the vaccines to people across the continent.Relatively few African countries have received supplies so far, and those that have done so have obtained them as a result of direct purchases from producers or donations from countries such as China and Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
