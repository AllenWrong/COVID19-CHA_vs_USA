US still politicizing virus origin tracing
2021-06-03 00:00
The ongoing push by the United States to get the World Health Organization to conduct further investigations into the origin of the novel coronavirus, including conducting another probe in China is nothing but an act to politicize a scientific issue aimed at stigmatizing China. A WHO team has already completed a field study in Wuhanwhere cluster infections were first reported. In February, the team of international experts, after weeks of visiting hospitals, laboratories and markets, and with the full cooperation of their Chinese counterparts, concluded that it was extremely unlikely the virus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, thus discrediting the claims being made by some in the US. But since the findings did not provide the fodder they sought for their smear campaign against China, some US politicians have refused to accept the fact. Because of their ineptitude in dealing with the pandemic, and their culpability in the failure to effectively control the viruswhich has already led to more than  million infection cases and , deaths in the country, they need a scapegoat. China, therefore, bears the blame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
