ROMEMario Draghi, the man credited with saving the eurozone in  at the height of the debt crisis, has been tapped to help one of its weakest links, Italy. The former head of the European Central Bank, or ECB, agreed on Wednesday to try to form a nonpolitical government to help resolve a political crisis that has threatened the ability of the eurozones thirdlargest economy to confront two concurrent crisesthe coronavirus emergency and a recession. Italian President Sergio Mattarella met with Draghi, who is credited with having saved the euro during Europes debt crisis, and gave him a mandate to try to form a new government to replace caretaker prime minister Giuseppe Contes coalition of the Star Movement and Democratic Party. Conte was forced to resign last month after exleader Matteo Renzi pulled his ministers of his small, centrist Italy Alive party from Contes government. Renzi had complained among other things about Contes plan to spend more than  billion in the European Unions funds and loans to help the economy recover from the pandemic. Known as Super Mario for rescuing the common currency during Europes debt crisis, Draghi was widely seen as a possible choice to lead a nonpolitical government if Conte was unable to gain new parliamentary support. Never give up Whatever it takes, is the famous phrase defining his turbulent period at the ECB, calming markets in  with his pledge to do the maximum to save the euro. Seven years later, he handed the reins of the bank to Christine Lagarde, telling Frances exfinance minister to never give up. Giuliano Noci, professor of strategy at Polytechnic University of Milan, said Draghi is an extremely wellprepared and determined person. He would certainly be able to lead Italy out of the crisis, with the support of the country and the parliament. Mattarella told the nation on Tuesday that early elections were illadvised at this crucial time. Italy, with more than , confirmed virus deaths, has the secondhighest COVID death toll in Europe after the United Kingdom. It is trying to ramp up its vaccination campaign and must report back to the EU how it plans to spend the recovery funds. It is therefore my duty to make an appeal to all the forces in the parliament so that they grant the confidence to a high profile government not linked to any political force, Mattarella said. News of Draghis expected appointment was wellreceived by the market on Wednesday, with the Milan stock exchange rising  percent after opening.
