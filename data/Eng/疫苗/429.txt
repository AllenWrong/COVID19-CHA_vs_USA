Lesley Cox, her husband and their daughter decided to go glampingglamorous campingin North Yorkshire, England, for a short holiday.With some restrictions still in place for overseas vacations, the yearold said it was too much hassle to travel outside of the United Kingdom.For a short break we didnt want to be spending a lot of time traveling, either, she said. We chose this minibreak because its only about an hours drive from home, so it was also minimal stress as we were traveling with our yearold daughter. Cox said the thought of flying and being in an enclosed space with other passengers isnt appealing at the moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
