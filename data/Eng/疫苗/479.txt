PhotoXinhua    COVID vaccines have a remarkable effect on preventing severe illness and death, said Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Gao said everyone should have confidence in vaccines as they provide basic immunization after two shots, and are able to alleviate the burden of disease. That is to say, vaccines seem a little bit weaker in preventing infection and disease since its hard to prevent circulation of the virus. But in preventing severe cases and death, vaccines have an obvious effect, said Gao at a parallel forum during the ongoing  Zhongguancun Forum on Saturday. Yin Zundong, director of the National Immunization Program at China CDC, said China has  COVID vaccine products that have entered phaseIII clinical trials overseas. He emphasized that the factors they took into consideration in formulating vaccine immunization strategies included the target populations risk of illness, the preventive effect of the COVID vaccine, safety, and speed of completing the target populations vaccination. For the next step, well continue to complete the inoculation of unvaccinated people and conduct further research for the vaccination of young people and boost their immunization, he said at the Saturdays forum.
