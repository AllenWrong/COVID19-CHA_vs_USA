2021-01-22 00:00
Despite earlier reports of slow vaccine rollouts, Californian officials said that the state is making steady progress in its mass vaccination campaign.  Today we are reporting ,, doses administered, so this exceeds our  million doses goal, said California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr Mark Ghaly on Tuesday in an update.  We still have data coming in. Its very much like testing was, where even if a test was administered on a certain day, it took a few days for the data system to catch up and count it as a test, said Ghaly, adding that the state is still tallying up the latest information from Friday.  In the United States most populous state, more than  million people have contracted the virus and , have died. It is also the first state in the US to register more than  million COVID cases, according to data released by state health authorities.  Even with the high number of cases, the states rollout of vaccinations has so far been frustratingly slow.  According to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of Wednesday, California has administered more than . million shots of the more than . million doses received from the federal government. This means that , doses were administered per , people, one of the slowest rates in the US.  The CDC estimated that more than . million Californians have received one or more doses, and , of them have gotten two or more doses.  More than . million doses have been distributed across the US, of which more than . million doses have been administered.  However, Californian officials assessment of the situation painted a rosier picture. Californian Governor Gavin Newsom pledged to inoculate  million more people against COVID in a day sprint.  When Newsom made the announcement on Jan , the state had already administered nearly , doses. California had initially hoped to vaccinate  million people by the end of last year, but it fell short of meeting that goal.  Dosage shortage  Ill tell you that because of these data delays, that we are confident that even more than the . million individuals that we captured the data about, we believe that the number is an underestimate of the true number of Californians who have been vaccinated, which is really the ultimate goal and the best news, Ghaly said.  Officials are still trying to figure out how many doses each health department across the state has already received.  I know how frustrating it must seem now to folks in LA county. Were not done with our healthcare workers. And we actually dont have enough vaccines right now to be able to get done more quickly with our healthcare workers, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Dr Barbara Ferrer said.  Logistic challenges associated with managing a vaccination site, as well as finding enough clinicians to perform the injections in a strained healthcare system, have all been cited as causes for the slow vaccine rollout.  Healthcare workers in LA county, the states epicenter of the COVID pandemic, had received more than , doses of vaccine, including more than , shots of the first dose and more than , shots of the second dose as of Jan , according to the Los Angeles Times. Officials estimated that roughly , healthcare workers still need to be vaccinated.  teresaliuchinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
