Deadly political virus of DPP
2021-06-16 00:00
Taiwan is experiencing its worst time in the pandemic, with the number of daily locally transmitted novel coronavirus infections surpassing  on average since last month and the daily death rate from COVID higher than the worlds average.  Unsurprisingly, rather than getting a grip on the situation, Taiwans ruling Democratic Progressive Party has chosen to take the latest surge in infections as an opportunity to ratchet up confrontation with the Chinese mainland and push its agenda of presenting the impression of the islands de facto independence.  Likewise some politicians in the United States have been using the pandemic as a pretext to interfere in Chinas internal affairs, and have been colluding with the DPPs provocations. After three US senators, under the pretext of arranging a donation of vaccines, paid a whirlwind visit to Taiwan on June , in a blatant violation of the three ChinaUS joint communiques that allow no official exchanges of any form between Washington and the Chinese island, some US senators reportedly plan to hold a hearing to discuss how to enhance relations with Taiwan and to urge the US administration to quicken its steps to provide vaccines to the island. This comes despite there being no details of which vaccines Taiwan will supposedly get and when the , COVID vaccine doses will be delivered to the island.  The DPP authorities along with the islands leader Tsai Ingwen and these US politicians have put politics above the wellbeing of Taiwan people. Their political manipulation and attempts to divert public attention have wasted precious time and resources and led to the islands failure to respond effectively to the spread of the virus.  Those turning vaccines into a political tool coldbloodedly disregard the spike in COVID cases on the island.  Beijing, by doing its best to help Taiwan compatriots fight the pandemic, has repeatedly shown its willingness to provide the island with mainlandmade vaccines, which have been cleared by the World Health Organization.  However, the DPP authorities have shown a cold shoulder to the mainlands show of goodwill, and even falsely claimed that the mainland was obstructing its vaccine procurement.  In stark contrast, incomplete statistics from the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council show that as of May , some , Taiwan compatriots had received their COVID vaccine jabs on the Chinese mainland.  The Taiwan authorities rejecting of the mainlands vaccine offer shows they have no respect for the life and health of people on the island and violate the most basic humanitarian spirit.  The political virus on display in Taiwan is worse than the novel coronavirus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
