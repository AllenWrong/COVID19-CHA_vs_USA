That the Belt and Road Initiative would be a game changer was evident from the moment President Xi Jinping proposed it in . The idea was to better connect Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime networks in order to stimulate trade and economic growth. The results are there for all to see. China has signed more than  Belt and Road cooperation agreements with  countries and  international organizations, and thirdparty market cooperation deals with  countries including Japan and Italy. And the initiatives concepts and propositions on cooperation have been included in documents of major international organizations including the United Nations, G, the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. It is in the spirit of Belt and Road cooperation that President Xi, while addressing a seminar on Friday, vowed to push forward with the highquality development of the initiatives projects. Which means they must be guided by high standards during construction, while efforts should be made to ensure that the projects are sustainable and can substantially improve peoples livelihoods in the countries involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
