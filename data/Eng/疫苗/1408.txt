Foreign scientist defends Wuhan labs operations

The only foreign virologist to have worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Hubei province before the COVID outbreak said she believes the virus was a naturally acquired infection at some point, somewhere.  Australian virologist Danielle Anderson, who worked at the institutes biosafety level laboratory until November , before the COVID outbreak was first reported, spoke to the media for the first time since the pandemic.  In an interview with Bloomberg, Anderson talked about her experiences at the institute and said halftruths and distorted information have obscured accurate accounting of the labs functions and activities.  Anderson is one of a dozen experts who were appointed to an international task force in November to study the origins of the virus. She said she didnt speak out sooner about her experience at the Wuhan lab because in early  she received threats from people in the US after she exposed false information about the pandemic that was posted online. She said she had filed a complaint with police over the threats.  Anderson, who currently works at the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, began to collaborate with the Wuhan Institute of Virology in , when she was scientific director of the biosafety lab at Singapores DukeNUS Medical School.  She was still working at the Wuhan lab when the virus, now known as SARSCoV, was, as believed by experts, beginning to spread at the end of . Anderson said she was in close proximity to many other scientists who worked at the institute. We went to dinners together, lunches we saw each other outside of the lab, she said.  No one she knew was ill toward the end of . In addition, Anderson said there is a procedure for reporting symptoms that correspond with the pathogens handled in highrisk containment labs. If people were sick, I assume that I would have been sickand I wasnt, she told Bloomberg. I was tested for coronavirus in Singapore before I was vaccinated, and had never had it.  Moreover, many of Andersons colleagues in Wuhan went to Singapore at the end of December  for a gathering on the Nipah virus. There was no word of any illness sweeping the laboratory, she said.  There was no chatter, Anderson said. Scientists are gossipy and excited. There was nothing strange from my point of view going on at that point that would make you think something is going on here.  Anderson found that speculation and accusations of the lab doing gainoffunction research on the coronavirus and leaking the virus, by accident or not, were distorted in the media.  She said there was no evidence such research occurred, and the likelihood it did is exceedingly slim. Its extremely difficult to get authorization to create a virus in this way, and even if gainoffunction research got the green light, its hard to achieve, Anderson said. Its exceedingly difficult to actually make it work when you want it to work, she said.  The virologist was impressed by the Wuhan institutes maximum biocontainment lab. She said the lab requires air, water and waste to be filtered and sterilized before it leaves the facility. There are strict protocols and requirements in place, and researchers have to undergo  hours of training to be certified to work independently in the lab.  According to Anderson, scientists at the Wuhan lab are required to demonstrate their knowledge of containment procedures and their competency in wearing airpressurized suits. They are also required to take both a chemical shower and a personal shower before they can leave the lab. Disinfection of the lab is conducted and monitored daily.  Anderson was so impressed with the safety protocol at the Wuhan lab that she implemented the measures in her own lab.  She believes that the virus is a natural occurrence. Because it took researchers almost a decade to pin down where in nature the SARS severe acute respiratory syndrome pathogen emerged, Anderson said shes not surprised the smoking gun bat responsible for the COVID outbreak hasnt been discovered yet.  Shi Zhengli, a top virologist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, again denied that she conducted gainoffunction research on the coronavirus in a recent interview with The New York Times.  My lab has never conducted or cooperated in conducting GOF experiments that enhance the virulence of viruses, she told the newspaper. This is no longer a question of science. It is speculation rooted in utter distrust.  mayzhouchinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
