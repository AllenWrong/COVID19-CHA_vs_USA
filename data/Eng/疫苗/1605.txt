Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said a recent survey conducted on the island showed that  percent of Taiwan residents support purchasing BioNTech vaccines through Shanghaibased Fosun Pharma. Fosun has expressed its willingness to provide to Taiwan the BioNTech vaccines it took part in researching and purchasing, but the DPP authority is blocking the effort, said Ma. Does the DPP consider its own interests more important than the lives and wellbeing of the public? Ma asked, urging the DPP to create favorable conditions to facilitate the entry of the vaccines.
