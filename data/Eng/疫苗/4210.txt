National Day holiday showcases benefits of Chinas effective control measures

I often frown upon the idea of travelling during the National Day holiday. Photos of huge crowds on the Bund in Shanghai, the Great Wall in Beijing and the Yellow Mountain in Anhui province are enough to scare me off. Yet the feeling this year has been totally different since the COVID pandemic has forced many countries to shut down most of the public facilities, including tourist sites, for most of the year. China was in the spotlight when novel coronavirus cases were reported in Wuhan in late December and a lockdown was imposed in the capital of the Hubei province and other cities on Jan , right before the Chinese Lunar New Year Eve, halting the biggest traveling season of the year to prevent the further spread of the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
