Zhong said the resurgence of the virus in Guangzhou, capital city of south Chinas Guangdong province, was the first time that China had to cope with the delta variant spreading in the community. The variant, which was first identified in India, has a shorter incubation period than other variants and the infected individuals experience longer recovery periods. Guangzhou has made some achievements in combating the variant, but other regions should take necessary precautions, said Zhong. A total of  cases were reported in Guangzhou from May, but no new local cases have been reported since June . The city has been removed from Chinas list of areas at mediumrisk for COVID, local health officials said on Saturday. Zhong said both provincial and citylevel disease control departments carried out timely and highquality epidemiological investigations after receiving a case report on May . The gene sequencing of all  cases in Guangzhou has now been carried out. The results show that the cases are homologous and the transmission chain is clear. These efforts provide data support for authorities to judge the situation and implement control measures, he said. Considering the high viral load and highly contagious nature of the delta strain, we clarified that anyone who was in the same space, unit or buildings as a patient up to four days before the onset of the disease was a close contact, said Zhong. Due to the change in the definition of close contacts, different management methods have been adopted. He said that Guangzhou has used big data to track people of concern, including those who have been to mediumrisk areas and close contacts of new cases. These new, innovative and more targeted antivirus methods have enabled us to control the resurgence in a quick manner, said Zhong. The delta strain has high viral load and short incubation period, which makes it twice as contagious as ordinary COVID, said the top epidemiologist. He said that to strike a balance between economic development and efforts to combat the delta variant, it is necessary to accelerate the pace of vaccination and build an immune barrier in the population. Zhong said preliminary analysis of more than  patients in Guangdong showed that Chinese vaccines are effective in preventing the development of pneumonia and severe infection. He urged more people to get vaccinated. As of Thursday, more than . billion vaccine doses have been administered on the Chinese mainland. We need  percent or more of the population vaccinated in the country to build an immune barrier, he said.
