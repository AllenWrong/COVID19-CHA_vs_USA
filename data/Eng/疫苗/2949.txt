Although a deal was not reached, Lopez Obrador said he and Biden agreed for teams from Mexico and the United States to study possibilities for sharing vaccines with Mexico. The possibility is not closed, Lopez Obrador told a news conference a day after a virtual meeting between the two leaders, referring to his request for the United States to help fill some of the gap in Mexicos vaccine supply. But its subject to the decision to be taken by teams both in Mexico and the United States. They will decide if its possible, and when, he added. Prior to the meeting, the White House had said its priority was to inoculate all Americans. Biden said last month that he was confident he could surpass his goal to administer  million COVID shots during his first  days in office  a deadline of late April. Lopez Obrador added that he and Biden had no disagreements over the matter, and that the two exchanged invitations to visit their respective countries. The leftist leader also said he expressed support for Bidens plans for migration reform that could legalize the residency status of migrants living without documentation in the United States. They see him as the migrants president, he said. The two did not discuss Mexicos controversial electricity reform, although Lopez Obrador said he emphasized the energy sector as a priority. A bill aimed at increasing state control of the electricity market has angered private businesses and could cause disputes with top trade partners. Reuters
