The head of the World Health Organization called on nations to show solidarity and make the most of the window of opportunity in the fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak. WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the opportunity was created because of the serious measures China has taken in Wuhan, Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, and other cities. He called on the world to fight the new virus as aggressively as possible. You strike hard when the window of opportunity is there. Thats what were saying to the rest of the world. Lets be serious in using the window of opportunity we have, he told the news conference on Tuesday afternoon. There had been , confirmed cases in China and more than , deaths as of Tuesday midnight, according to Chinas National Health Commission. Tedros revealed that the first vaccine could be ready in  months, adding that we have to do everything today using the available weapons to fight this virus, while preparing for the longterm. This is a common enemy, WHO announced on Tuesday to name the disease caused by novel coronavirus COVID, meaning coronavirus disease that emerged in . It said that it had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease. Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing, Tedros said, clearly referring to some controversial and racially charged terms used by some news outlets and politicians. He expressed that the main outcome from a twoday research and innovation forum on the novel coronavirus that opened in Geneva on Tuesday will be an agreed road map on what questions we need to ask, and how we will go about answering those questions. The forum gathered more than  leading scientists, public health experts and officials from around the world, including many who attended remotelyonline or by phone. In his opening remarks, Tedros said the delegates were not there to talk about politics or money, but science. He warned that the outbreak is testing the world. Its a test of political solidaritywhether the world can come together to fight a common enemy that does not respect borders or ideologies. Its a test of financial solidaritywhether the world will invest now in fighting this outbreak, or pay more later to deal with its consequences. And its a test of scientific solidaritywill the world come together to find shared answers to shared problems? he said. He said there is still much that is not known about the virus, such as the transmission dynamics, the period of infectiousness, how samples can be used for diagnosis and the monitoring of treatment, the best way to manage cases of severe disease, and the ethical issues to be aware of in research. To defeat this outbreak, we need answers to all those questions, and more, he told the delegates. The bottom line is solidarity, solidarity, solidarity, he said, adding that the mantra is especially relevant in the realm of the sharing of samples and sequences. The WHO chief thanked Chinese experts and officials who attended the forum online. We want you to know that we stand with you in solidarity, and we wish you courage, patience, success, and good health in these extremely trying circumstances, he said. Michael Ryan, executive director of WHOs Health Emergencies Program, warned people on Tuesday not to attach unnecessary stigma to the outbreak. This is an unfortunate event, he said. In the Monday briefing, he praised Chinas capacities and capabilities in fighting the outbreak and repeated what Tedros had said, if the disease reaches a health system that is not as capable as Chinas, the situation could become much worse. chenweihuachinadaily.com.cn         World Health Organization DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addresses a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday.
