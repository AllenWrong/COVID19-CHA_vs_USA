PhotoAgencies    NEWARK, United States  Presidentelect Joe Biden on Monday received his second COVID shot, and said that getting vaccines into peoples arms would be a number one priority for his incoming administration. It comes as vaccine rollout has faltered badly in the worlds hardesthit country, where some , people have died from the coronavirus and about , more are dying every day. Some . million first doses of COVID vaccines have been shipped out to hospitals, clinics and nursing homes across the country, but only around  million have been injected, according to official data. The yearold incoming president arrived at the Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware in the early afternoon, removed his blazer, and thanked the nurse who injected his left arm with the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. My number one priority is getting vaccine in peoples arms, like we just did today, as rapidly as we can, he told reporters, adding that he would be holding a virtual meeting with his coronavirus team later on, and announcing a new strategy on Thursday. Three to four thousand people a day dying is just beyond the pale... its wrong, and we can do a lot to change it. He emphasized the need to continue social distancing and mask wearing, and added that he was appalled that Republican lawmakers refused to wear masks when they were forced into a security lockdown during last weeks Capitol attack by supporters of President Donald Trump. I think its irresponsible. Its not a political issue, its an issue of public safety. Biden has also pledged to push for more direct stimulus checks to taxpayers, and said he was speaking with Republican lawmakers about moving on a second package sooner rather than later. AFP
