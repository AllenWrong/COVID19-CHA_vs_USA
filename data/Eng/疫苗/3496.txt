PhotoAgencies    COPENHAGEN  An adverse reaction to the first dose of the COVID vaccine may be responsible for as many as  reported deaths among frail and elderly patients in nursing homes in Norway, said a press release from the Norwegian Medicines Agency NoMA on Friday.  The studies on Comirnaty PfizerBioNTech included few participants aged over  and did not include patients with unstable or acute illness, according to NoMA. The assessment suggests that common adverse reactions to mRNA vaccines, such as fever and nausea, may have contributed to a fatal outcome in some frail patients, said Sigurd Hortemo, NoMAs chief physician. Reports of suspected adverse reactions including death are received on a daily basis and are continuously assessed by both the Norwegian Medicines Agency and the National Institute of Public Health NIPH, said the press release. As a result of  autopsies of the deceased undertaken for the assessment, the NIPH has updated the COVID vaccination guidelines, providing more detailed advice on the vaccination of the elderly who are frail. Doctors must now carefully consider who should be vaccinated. Those who are very frail and at the very end of life can be vaccinated after an individual assessment, Madsen added.
