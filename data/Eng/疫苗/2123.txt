Vaccine hoarding blamed for global gap
2021-04-30 00:00
Developing countries are struggling with a shortage of coronavirus vaccines, due in part to the hoarding of supplies and the protection of intellectual property in affluent nations.  The causes vary globally, but the major factors are the national hoarding of vaccine doses as well as raw materials and technical expertise patent and liability protection by pharmaceutical companies, which prevent countries from sharing vaccines and the dominance of vaccine production by the worlds wealthiest countries.  Drug companies that developed and won authorization for the vaccines in record time have agreed to sell most of the first doses off production lines to the United States, European countries and a few other wealthy nations.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the directorgeneral of the World Health Organization, has described the situation as another brick in the wall of inequality between the worlds haves and havenots.  Maria Van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist with the WHO, told The Washington Post that global vaccine inequities are outrageous ethically, morally, scientifically.  The health agency will soon decide whether to give emergency approval to Chinas two main COVID vaccines, WHO Assistant DirectorGeneral Mariangela Batista Galvao Simao said on Monday.  If the WHO grants emergency use authorization for the two Chinese vaccines, it will be a boost for the global vaccine access program COVAX, and give the green light to some developed countries that are anxiously awaiting the endorsement so they can import the Chinese vaccines.  WHO approval is expected, since the Chinese vaccines safety and efficacy have been tested and proved. More than  million Chinese vaccine doses have been administered domestically, and  million in foreign countries, particularly in Latin America, Asia and Africa.  Vaccine nationalism  Socalled vaccine nationalism is also said to be hindering the flow of doses to poorer nations through COVAX. The program, jointly run by the WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is an effort to pool resources to develop and equitably distribute vaccines to  lowand middleincome countries this year.  COVAX aims to distribute  billion doses in , a fraction of what is needed. So far, it has delivered  million.  India, the worlds largest vaccine producermostly using the AstraZeneca formulahas sold or donated tens of millions of vaccine doses to other countries as part of COVAX. But it has largely stopped exporting as its own surge in infections has grown worse.  This dealt a major setback to the rollout, since COVAX had expected  percent of its initial doses to come from Indias Serum Institute, the countrys largest vaccine maker.  The gulf in vaccine access has spurred calls to waive intellectual property protections.  Economist and Columbia University Professor Joseph Stiglitz, along with Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizens Global Trade Watch, said in an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Monday that preserving intellectual property barriers to COVID vaccines is morally wrong and foolish.  They wrote that waiving intellectual property rights so developing countries could produce more vaccines would make a big difference in reaching global herd immunity.  Threefourths of the worlds vaccine doses have been administered in just  nations, which together account for less than half the worlds population.  At the current rate vaccines are being administered,  of the worlds poorest countries wont vaccinate  percent of their populations until  or later, according to a report written by Krishna Udayakumar and Mark McClellan, health experts at Duke University.  The low global rate of vaccination will make it harder to reach herd immunity, in which a sufficient percentage of the population is inoculated, making it much more difficult for the virus to mutate. But if the mutations prove resistant to vaccines, they could spread anywhere in the world, including in Western countries that have been vaccinated first.  India, where barely  percent of the population has been vaccinated, is battling the worlds fastest spread of coronavirus infections. It is approaching  million cases and more than , deaths from COVID, according to data as of Wednesday evening from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.  India is second worldwide in cases and deaths, behind the United States, which has recorded more than  million infections and over , deaths.  Honduras, meanwhile, has obtained , vaccine doses for its  million people. In Africa, just  million doses have been acquired for the continents . billion people, and of the countries reporting data in Africa, most have vaccinated less than  percent of the population.  In Namibia, only  of the nations . million people had received two doses of vaccine as of midApril.  We did apply and paid our deposit for the COVID vaccine, but there is a vaccine apartheid, Namibian President Hage Geingob told reporters. I am saying that we, a small country, have paid a deposit but up to now we didnt get any vaccine.
