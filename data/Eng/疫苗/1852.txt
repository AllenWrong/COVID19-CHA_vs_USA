Pandemic calls for unprecedented unity

Although the sporadic locally transmitted cases appearing each day over the past two weeks might appear inconsequential in comparison to the situation in many other countries, the extreme vigilance the country has exercised toward them explains why it managed to bring the novel coronavirus largely under control last year, even before COVID vaccines became available.  The cluster of infections in Anhui, Liaoning and Guangdong provinces seem to have been effectively checked, and the appearance of these new cases has prompted more people to get vaccinatedmore than  million doses of vaccines are now administered each day nationwide.  According to the National Health Commission, as of Tuesday, about  million doses of vaccines had been administered on the Chinese mainland. It took about  days for the number of administered doses of vaccines to increase from  million to  million, but only seven days for the number to rise from  million to  million.  If this growth trend can be maintained, the country will be able to have between  million and  billion people vaccinated by the end of this year, raising its vaccination rate to  percent to  percent, the level required for herd immunity.  By achieving this goal, China, which has about onesixth of the worlds population, would undoubtedly make another huge contribution to the worlds fight against the pandemic.  So far China has produced more than  million doses of vaccinesof those  million have gone to other countriesand its vaccine output will probably exceed  billion by the end of this year. That will lay a solid foundation not only for the countrys own vaccination drive but also for it to export and donate more vaccines to other countries.  President Xi Jinping announced at the Global Health Summit last week that as well as providing an additional  billion in international aid over the next three years to support the fight against COVID and promote social recovery, China will continue to provide the world with vaccines to the best of its ability. It also supports waiving intellectual property rights on COVID vaccines, and is encouraging Chinese vaccine companies to transfer technologies to other developing countries and carry out joint production with them.  It is therefore almost predictable that China will continue to be the largest supplier of COVID vaccines to the developing and leastdeveloped countries.  With repeated resurgences around the world and frequent mutations, the novel coronavirus is still wreaking havoc. To clinch an early victory against the virus and restore economic growth, all stakeholders should follow Chinas example of putting people first and looking beyond their own borders so as to ensure a coordinated, systemic and effective response to the pandemic. The world must work and stick together to help each other, particularly those countries most in need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
