Hotels in Hong Kong face hurdles on road to recovery
2021-07-16 09:13
Hong Kong is well known for being home to some of the worlds finest hotels, with a flourishing hospitality industry driven by the rapid growth of international business and leisure travel and increased demand for accommodation at every price level  at least before the pandemic. The desire to work hard, progress and succeed seems to be woven into the DNA of every Hong Kong professional. And this sophisticated city offers the ideal environment for them to thrive and stand out. Their creativity, drive, innovation and achievements have been vital to the success of Hong Kongs hotel and tourism industry, and the results  which are clear to see  are admired by the industry at large. I, for one, applaud them for their incredible efforts. And I strongly encourage them to continue. For several decades, the Hong Kong hotel market has ranked among the strongest in the world, with high yield, overall performance, and profitability. The combination of domestically grown hotel brands with key global players, plus the wit and grit of local talent merged with the extensive experience and skills of the top foreign professionals, has made Hong Kongs hospitality scene a very enterprising and industrious landscape. Direct competitors are no doubt envious. With all that it offers, Hong Kong is a wellrecognized international destination, attracting visitors from all over the world. However, with international borders closed due to the COVID pandemic, that line of business has dried up, and the weak part of the Hong Kong hotel scene has been exposed  that is, limited demand from the domestic market. In this situation, hotels have had to become very creative in developing attractive staycation packages for the local market. We have seen many resilient Hong Kong hoteliers demonstrate much resourcefulness and entrepreneurship in this regard. However, the volume is not sufficient to cover basic operational expenses and the financial commitments of the properties  a clear situation of unbalanced supply and demand. We all look forward to the reopening of borders to international travelers and returning to some kind of normality in the hospitality business. But we have to accept that returning to a virusfree situation may take years. In the meantime, human interaction will continue to be guided and shaped by safety measures and procedures. Unfortunately, it appears that the road to recovery will be a long one. The virus will continue to circulate in pockets of the global population  Hong Kong included  with sporadic small outbreaks experienced worldwide. As a species, we have learned to live with influenza, dengue fever, and other viruses in our midst. With COVID becoming endemic, we now have to do the same with this virus too. Countries worldwide are trying to manage the pandemic by balancing economic and social demands while protecting the health of their citizens. And this applies to the travel and tourism industry too. It is a fact that travel will always include some element of risk, and this may increase in the next era of travel. Living with an endemic means we shouldnt completely close the borders. Global cities and the hospitality industry need essential supplies  including a constant flow of healthyvaccinated travelers crossing borders with minimal fuss and maximum logic. Hong Kongs relative success in containing the virus so far, combined with its longestablished reputation as one of the worlds top travel destinations, can provide a solid foundation for its revival and return to one of the most dynamic hospitality and tourism markets once the situation stabilizes. As a major global city and destination, Hong Kongs existing strengths in financial services, trade, transport, communications, the very best in culinary offerings, and tourist attractions and infrastructure are as strong as ever. In addition, the beauty and the size of the country parks and coastal areas, a landscape from sandy beaches and rocky foreshores to heights of almost , meters, is something that Hong Kong can be proud of and that can be promoted to foreign visitors. The destination will remain an appealing choice for business and leisure travelers, and demand will gradually increase. The integration of the GuangdongHong KongMacao Greater Bay Area is expected to be a major plus for the hospitality industry. The road to recovery will require hoteliers to adjust to an operational new normal, particularly regarding roles and responsibilities, staffing levels, efficiency, agility, technology and innovation, responding to market trends and retaining the dominant position. There is strong confidence in Hong Kongs innovative spirit and the ability of its hospitality professionals to adapt and progress. In this environment, travel and tourism will become more purposeful, with great emphasis placed on safety and security, wellness and sustainability. And hotels are expected to focus on providing experiences, authenticity, privacy and space. Consumer behavior and eventually consumertravelers spending have been and will continue to be altered and business plansstrategies need to be adapted to those new circumstances, and all markets or destinations  including Hong Kong, for which travel and tourism are very important  will have to react to this. It is imperative for Hong Kong to retain its dominant position. Theres no going back to the way things were before the pandemic. We must accept the new reality, with new opportunities, new business models and shifting consumer preferences.
