China has noticed that the Taliban might announce the formation of a new government in the coming days, said Wang, expressing his hope that the new government will be open and inclusive, completely cut off from terrorist organizations, and establish and develop good relations with other countries, especially neighboring countries.As common neighbors of Afghanistan, China and Iran need to strengthen communication and coordination to play a constructive role in achieving a smooth transition and peaceful reconstruction of Afghanistan, said Wang.Although the United States has pulled out its troops from Afghanistan, Wang said, it still has an inescapable responsibility for the peaceful reconstruction of Afghanistan and should not try by any means to make new troubles or even turmoils for Afghanistan, or undermine the legitimate rights and interests of its neighboring countries.As for the United States saying that its withdrawal from Afghanistan allows it to focus more on dealing with China and Russia, Wang said such notion not only serves as an excuse for Americas own failure, but also reveals the nature of its pushing for power politics in the world.If the U.S. is unable to learn the due lessons and turn to a completely fresh start, its bound to make mistakes more serious than those in Afghanistan, and to slide from the failure in Afghanistan to greater failures, Wang noted.Amir Abdollahian said that the root cause of the chaos in Afghanistan is the irresponsibility of the United States, adding that Afghanistan should establish a broad and inclusive government reflecting the interests of all ethnic groups in the country.The Iranian side calls on the international community to spare no effort to provide humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan and prevent any turmoil in Afghanistan from triggering a refugee wave, he said.Iran is ready to strengthen coordination with China to help Afghanistan get out of difficulties at an early date, he added.
