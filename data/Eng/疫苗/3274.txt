Western vaccine bias ridiculous
2021-02-03 00:00
There is a deeprooted bias in the West, which propels some politicians there to look at everything Chinese through the prism of ideology.It is through such a prism that many things that have nothing to do with politics have been politicized. Vaccines from China being a case in point. The safety and effectiveness of the vaccines China has developed have been continually called into question by some Western countries. And Chinas promise to deliver its vaccines as a global public good has been misrepresented as vaccine diplomacy.Of course, if China kept the vaccines it has developed for its own use, they would have accused China of being selfish, instead of claiming that it is promoting its influence through the provision of vaccines. Viewed through the prism of the Wests bias, China can do nothing right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
