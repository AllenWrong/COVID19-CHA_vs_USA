While mixing and matching might be interesting for people living in countries where vaccines are in short supply, more studies are needed in order to ensure immunogenicity and safety, a WHO spokesperson cited the organizations Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan as saying at a regular press briefing organized by the UN office in Geneva. Data from mix and match studies of different vaccines are awaited  immunogenicity and safety both need to be evaluated, Swaminathan was quoted as saying. According to the information provided by the WHO spokesperson at Tuesdays briefing, a clinical trial led by the University of Oxford in Britain is currently ongoing to investigate mixing the regimen of the AstraZeneca vaccine and the PfizerBioNTech vaccine. This trial was recently expanded to include the Moderna and Novavax vaccines. The WHO spokesperson said that preliminary findings from the University of Oxford trial showed that people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine for their first dose, followed by the PfizerBioNTech vaccine as the second dose, had a higher likelihood of fever and other typical mild side effects than if they had stayed with two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
