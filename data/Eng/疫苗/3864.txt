A unicorn is a market term for a startup worth at least  billion.Moving forward, Chinese companies will have more opportunities to invest in the UAE, particularly in innovative sectors such as artificial intelligence and agricultural technology, Al Dhaheri said.With China shifting to a development pattern known as dual circulation, in which domestic circulation is the mainstay with the domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other, Al Dhaheri said the UAE is ready to actively engage with this new strategy. By doing so, this would help the two sides to achieve a target of increasing bilateral trade to  billion by .The UAE is Chinas secondlargest trading partner in the Arab world, and its largest export market within that region. Bilateral trade reached . billion in .Chinas dualcirculation strategy focuses on international trade as a core component of sustainable growth, Al Dhaheri said. We welcome this approach, and foresee many areas of future growth in food sustainability, logistics, energy security, and international development assistance.The Gulf nation was among the first countries to sign an agreement on the joint building of the Belt and Road Initiative with China, and the UAE envoy highlighted the role of the BRI in leading the regional economic recovery.He stressed the strong competitiveness of the UAEs aviation network, which will contribute to the success of the BRI.The UAE has become an important gateway for China to enter West Asia and North Africa, with over  percent of Chinas trade with the Middle East now transiting through the UAE, Al Dhaheri said. And we will continue and deepen logistics cooperation, ensuring a pathway to prosperity for our nations and the world.
