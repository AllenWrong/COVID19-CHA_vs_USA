Looking ahead, Lam promised intensified efforts to improve education, media, and the training and management of civil servants. With these work being done, people will have more confidence in one country, two systems, no matter they are local residents, people from the mainland or foreigners.  We will certainly do more to reach out to the people, understand their concerns and respond directly and positively, Lam said. She highlighted land reclamation as the major solution to the undersupply of land and the housing shortage in Hong Kong.  Regarding the socalled foreign sanctions, Lam said she will not be intimidated. She said three words and phrases would perfectly describe the external interference in Hong Kong affairs over the past years double standards, hypocrisy, and lies.        Chief Executive of Chinas Hong Kong Special Administrative Region HKSAR Carrie Lam attends an exclusive interview with Xinhua at her office in Hong Kong, south China, April , . XinhuaWang Shen    HONG KONG  With legislative changes on improving Hong Kongs electoral system adopted by Chinas top legislature, Carrie Lam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region HKSAR, expects a more peaceful and prosperous Hong Kong under one country, two systems. She also expects stronger confidence among people at home and abroad in the prospects of the global financial hub. During her first exclusive interview after the amendments at the state level, Lam explained to Xinhua her work agenda ranging from local electoral legislation to tackling deepseated social problems. FOR A BETTER HONG KONG The National Peoples Congress NPC Standing Committee on Tuesday adopted the amended Annex I and Annex II to the Basic Law of the HKSAR, which concerns the method for the selection of the HKSAR chief executive and the method for the formation of the HKSAR Legislative Council LegCo and its voting procedures, respectively. It marks an important step forward in improving the electoral system of Hong Kong, Lam told Xinhua. As Hong Kong has embarked on the relevant local legislation, Lam and the HKSAR government will have a busy schedule in the next  months, including revising local laws and holding elections of the Election Committee, the LegCo and the HKSAR chief executive. Lam met with LegCo President Andrew Leung to discuss the work ahead on Tuesday, shortly after the passage of the amended annexes to the Basic Law at the session of the NPC Standing Committee. The LegCo had been plunged into chaos and could hardly perform its constitutional functions in its first three years since . The legislature has now resumed normal operation after the exit of LegCo members engaged in repeated filibusters and legislative violence. But it does not mean the LegCo will become an echo chamber. They lawmakers can criticize us and oppose what we put forward, Lam said, adding that the one country, two systems principle and national security must be respected and protected. With the improved electoral system, she believed more capable and responsible talents, who might have been frustrated by the political disorder in the past, will present themselves in the future. Looking ahead, Lam promised intensified efforts to improve education, media, and the training and management of civil servants. With these work being done, people will have more confidence in one country, two systems, no matter they are local residents, people from the mainland or foreigners. PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST With the improved electoral system, Lam believed it is high time for the global financial hub to refocus on the economy, raise peoples living standards, and tackle entrenched social problems. The HKSAR government will place more emphasis on putting people first and more earnestly tend to grassroots issues, Lam said. We will certainly do more to reach out to the people, understand their concerns and respond directly and positively.
