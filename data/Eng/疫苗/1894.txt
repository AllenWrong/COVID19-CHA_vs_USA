HONG KONG  The awards presentation ceremony of the annual Shaw Prize for  was held online on Thursday, with six scientists commended for their prominent work in the prizes three categories of astronomy, life science and medicine, and mathematical sciences.The Hong Kongbased Shaw Prize Foundation announced the list of  laureates in May last year. The six scientists are from the United States, Britain, Germany and Israel. Due to the COVID pandemic, the inperson awarding ceremony originally scheduled for September  was cancelled.Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region HKSAR Carrie Lam delivered a video speech at the virtual awarding ceremony Thursday.In her speech, Lam noted that the COVID pandemic emphasized how much people count on scientists continuing pursuit of excellence.
