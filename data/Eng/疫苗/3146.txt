PhotoAgencies    Italy can trace its earliest COVID infection case back to last November, an international research team claimed in their latest findings. In a paper published in the British Journal of Dermatology, researchers claimed a serological test of SARSCoV, the virus that causes COVID, was positive for an Italian patient who reported dermatosis disease in November  and recovered in April . The patient, a yearold woman from Milan, showed urticarial plaquelike dermatosis on her arms but only complained about a mild sore throat as a COVIDsimilar symptom. The research team, led by R. Gianotti from the Dermatology Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation at the University of Milan, said they analyzed skin biopsies of patients from Milan with dermatoses and positive PCR swabs for SARSCoV at different stages of the infection. The results were compared to skin biopsies of  COVID nondiagnosed patients with dermatoses, who were at high risk of COVID infection. They were considered at high risk because either they presented mild COVID symptoms or had been in close contact with SARSCoV positive individuals. Histopathological features and patterns showed no differences between these two groups. Furthermore,  percent of skin samples from the highrisk group were positive for SARSCoV nucleocapsid antigens. All these facts lead to us believe that our patient could represent the oldest case in literature of detection of the virus on a tissue sample. Can we then call it the dermatological Italian patient zero? the researchers wrote in the paper.        R.Gianotti receives an interview with China Central Television in a news program.
