Thanks to stringent epidemic prevention and control measures and workers heeding the call from the authorities to stay in the cities where they work rather than returning to their hometowns, the reemergence of the novel coronavirus seems to have been basically checked on the Chinese mainland.The National Health Commission on Wednesday reported only seven new COVID cases, all imported, in the past  hours, with near zero locally transmitted cases reported for a dozen days.All this paves the way for economic activities and social life to quickly return to normal nationwide after epidemic responses were upgraded in many places including Hebei province and Beijing in midDecember following the detection of nonimported infections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
