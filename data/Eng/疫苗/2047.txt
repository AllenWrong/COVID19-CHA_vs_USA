PhotoXinhua    HONG KONG  Hong Kong will shorten the quarantine period from May  for inbound visitors who have been fully vaccinated against the COVID pandemic. Travelers will face varied arrangements depending on their places of departure as public health authorities have divided overseas areas into five categories based on the severity of the pandemic, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government said Friday. People from lowrisk areas including Australia and Singapore will have their mandatory quarantine shorted from two weeks to one plus selfmonitoring for seven days, Thomas Chan, the permanent secretary for food and health health, said at a press conference. Chan said those granted the shorter quarantine should take the second shot of the COVID vaccine two weeks before their arrival. The current day quarantine period for those from mediumtohighrisk places will be reduced to two weeks plus seven days of selfmonitoring. But the policies for visitors from places of extremely and very high risks remained unchanged. Inbound visitors from the mainland, Macao or Taiwan, except those under the Returnhk travel scheme, will undergo sevenday quarantine plus selfmonitoring for seven days.
