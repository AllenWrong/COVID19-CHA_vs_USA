DPPs calculated blame game costs lives

Despite the islands independenceminded Democratic Progressive Party trying to portray it otherwise, the rejection of the proposal that Taiwan be allowed to participate in the World Health Organizations annual assembly has nothing to do with Taiwan peoples fight against the resurgence of the novel coronavirus on the island.  The wellbeing of Taiwan compatriots is always of concern to the Chinese mainland, especially in times of difficulties. Thats why the mainland offered to provide vaccines and send its epidemic prevention and control experts to share its experience with Taiwans medical and health professionals soon after the COVID pandemic situation on the island took a turn for the worse recently.  Yet that gesture of goodwill has received a cold shoulder from the islands DPP government, which is only interested in politicizing the health issue for its own political gain, rather than working to protect its people from the disease.  To justify the confrontational approach it has taken against the mainland, the islands top health official Chen Shihchung has gone so far as to claim that the mainlands vaccines are not safe and most residents in Taiwan do not want to take them, despite the fact that the mainland has vaccinated more than  million of its people and shared the vaccines with dozens of countries worldwide without any problems emerging.  Since the island is still struggling to control the latest outbreak, with  new local infections and six deaths reported on Tuesday, the most urgent task for the islands authorities is to increase its low vaccination ratewhich now stands at about  percent of the populationas soon as possible.  Its low vaccination rate is primarily caused by a shortage of vaccines. And although the island has ordered more than  million doses of the AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines, the first batch will not arrive until the end of June. By rejecting the mainlands offer of vaccines, the Taiwan authorities are risking peoples lives, as they are losing the race against time in the fight against the coronavirus.  In contrast to its not so timely response to a spike in infections, the DPP has wasted no time or opportunity to vilify the mainland, trying to portray it as being the one putting peoples lives at risk by isolating the island from the international antiepidemic endeavors and preventing it from getting vaccines.  To the contrary, since the early stages of COVID, the mainland has timely updated Taiwan about the situation and approved the participation by Taiwan health experts in  WHO technical activities. Blood is thicker than water. This is a fact that Taiwan authorities can never change whatever political tricks they play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
