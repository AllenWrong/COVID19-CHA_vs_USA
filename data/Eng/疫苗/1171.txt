Lockdown makes way for confusion in England
2021-07-21 00:00
Many COVID restrictions in England have been lifted, despite the government admitting that case numbers will rise as a result. Three prominent Cabinet members have also been forced to spend the socalled Freedom Day selfisolating. Social distancing rules no longer apply and face masks are no longer mandatory, though the Transport for London said masks remain compulsory for passengers. Many shops still request customers to wear masks. On Saturday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid reported that he had tested positive for the virus and would be in selfisolation. It emerged the following day that Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak had come into contact with him, but would not be selfisolating as they were taking part in a pilot daily testing program not yet available to the general public.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
