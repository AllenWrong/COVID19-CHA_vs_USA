Easing of COVIDrelated air travel restrictions met with joy, tears                    Sydneys international airport came alive with tears, embraces and laughter on Monday as Australias border opened for the first time in  months, with some arriving travelers ripping away mandatory masks to see the faces of loved ones theyve been separated from for so long.Just being able to come home without having to go to quarantine is huge, Carly Boyd, a passenger who had traveled from New York, told reporters at Sydneys KingsfordSmith Airport, where Peter Allens I Still Call Australia Home was playing.Theres a lot of people on that flight who have loved ones who are about to die or have people who died this week. So for them to be able to get off the plane and go see them straightaway is pretty amazing, Boyd added.Australia is betting that vaccination rates are now high enough to mitigate the risk of allowing international visitors again after maintaining some of the lengthiest and strictest border controls anywhere during the COVID pandemic.Before the pandemic, Sydney was Australias busiest international airport, but until Monday it had been almost deserted.The new freedoms mean that outbound, fully vaccinated Australian permanent residents and citizens can leave the country for any reason without asking the government for an exemption from a travel ban that has trapped most at home since March .Incoming Australians who have been vaccinated are able to come home without quarantining in a hotel for two weeks. The cap on hotel quarantine numbers had been a major obstacle for thousands of Australians stranded overseas. That cap now only applies to unvaccinated travelers.Sydney was the first Australian airport to announce it would reopen on Monday, because New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, was the first state where  percent of the population ages  and older have been fully vaccinated. Melbourne and the national capital, Canberra, also reopened on Monday after Victoria state and the Australian Capital Territory achieved the vaccination benchmark.Graham Turner, chief executive of Australias largest travel agency, Flight Center, said international travel to Australia was not expected to return to normal until mid.It will come back quickly for those people who really want to travel. Initially, its the friends and relatives. People who havent seen each other for a long time, Turner said.Thailand, too, was reopening its borders on Monday. Hundreds of vaccinated foreign tourists arrived in Bangkok for quarantinefree travel after the Southeast Asian nation gave the green light for such visitors from more than  countries, including China and the United States.Several European nations are also on the list, as Thailand, one of the regions most popular destinations, looks to capitalize on visitors from the Northern Hemisphere who want to escape the winter blues.Those hopes appeared to pay off early, with German tourist Simon Raithel and a group of friends among the first to arrive in Bangkok, capital of the nation.Right now, in Europe, its quite cold, said Raithel, , who planned to head to islands in southern Thailand. We just picked this flight and it is quite surprising that we are the first flight to arrive.Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
