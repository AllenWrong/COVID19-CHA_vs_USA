2020-05-16 00:00
Almost  percent of the worlds students have been affected as governments in  countries have temporarily closed educational institutions as part of the measures to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic, according to UNESCO data. From preprimary to high school to university, the pandemic has affected education at all levels, and poses four main challenges to the education system worldwide.First, movement of people worldwide has been disrupted because of the antivirus measures taken by almost all countries. Thanks to Chinas rapid economic development, and peoples rising incomes and improving living standards, the numbers of Chinese traveling, holidaying and studying abroad have been continuously increasing. But since the outbreak, countries across the world have changed their immigration policies, even if temporarily, and implemented traffic control measures to contain the spread of the virus. This has drastically reduced the movement of people, international air travel in particular, affecting the education of students, including those seeking education overseas, dealing a big blow to the global education industry.Second, the outbreak has seen some politicians, business leaders, professionals, civil societies, interest groups and individuals making claims and counterclaims on the origin of the virus, measures to prevent and control its spread, and research to find a cure or develop a vaccine for COVID. Such developments have intensified racism and xenophobia in some countries, and prompted many to stigmatize a particular group or country, which reflect their refusal to accept cultural diversity and that poses a threat to the existing world order and the global education industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
