Japan party race for top job wide open
2021-09-07 10:07
Japanese might have thought they had seen the end of the revolving door era for national leaders when Shinzo Abe held down the job of prime minister for nearly eight years. When Abe passed the baton to Yoshihide Suga in September , few would have thought that Suga, as his righthand man, would bow out after just a year in the top job. Sugas announcement on Friday that he wont stand for reelection as chief of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party leaves the field clear for his challengers in a party vote late this month as a national election looms.

PhotoAgencies    Former party policy chief Fumio Kishida and former internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi have already thrown their hats in the ring for the election, which rewards the winner with the post of prime minister. Much as the winner will be hoping that the revolving door wont return as a fixture in Japanese politics, history cant be ignored. Prime ministers in Japan changed nearly every year from  to . Kishida and the Abebacked Takaichi will be hoping to buck that history. Seiko Noda, the LDPs executive acting secretarygeneral, is also considering a run. Administrative reform minister Taro Kono said he will announce his stance this week. Former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba is monitoring moves within the party and weighing his next step. Campaigning for the race is scheduled to start on Sept . Voting, and the count, will take place on Sept . The winner will succeed Suga as the LDP leader and effectively become Japans next prime minister, given the LDPs strength in the House of Representatives, the lower house of parliament. A poll by Kyodo News released on Sunday showed that Kono, who is also in charge of COVID jabs, is the most popular pick to succeed Suga. Kono gained . percent of support from respondents in the nationwide telephone survey conducted on Saturday and Sunday, ahead of Ishiba with . percent and Kishida with . percent. The opinion polls, however, do not necessarily mean that there is a clear frontrunner in this race. The party election will be held with LDP lawmakers holding  votes and rankandfile members holding an equal number, and whoever wins a majority of the combined  votes will become the partys president. In another Kyodo survey conducted last month, the approval rating for Sugas cabinet was . percent, down from . percent immediately after he took office last September when his image as a selfmade man and son of a farmer was viewed positively. Suga said on Friday that his decision not to run in the LDP leadership race will pave the way for a new prime minister to lead the party into the elections. Suga became prime minister on Sept , . He has been unpopular with voters for a variety of reasons, all to do with how his government has responded to the pandemic. The vaccine rollout in Japan has been perceived to be haphazard and slow. Fears that COVID cases would spike during and following the Olympics were largely realized, as infections and hospitalizations skyrocketed across Japan, with no apparent government plans to deal with the situation. Several younger LDP lawmakers had voiced their concerns that the LDP could not win the next election for the lower house, which will take place by Nov  at the latest, with Suga at the helm. Lawmakers who entered national politics in the  lower house election that ushered in the LDPs return to power are now serving their third term. There are  of these threeterm members, more than any other group. Including those who were first elected in  and , members serving three or fewer terms account for  percent of all LDP lower house legislators. Approval ratings These younger members who have never experienced a difficult election became worried about Sugas low approval ratings and began pushing for another leader. Sugas own personal qualities made things worse. Critics say he took a topdown decisionmaking approach to policy issues without carefully weighing the opinions of a wide range of advisers. He rejected dissenting voices and focused on data convenient for his agenda. The final straw was Sugas suggestion of a hasty dissolution of the House of Representatives, with a reshuffle of LDP executives, ahead of the party vote. Such maneuvering was seen by some as a means for Suga to disregard political norms in a blatant attempt to cling to power. Sugas decision to depart the stage caught most Japanese off guard. The Mainichi Shimbun, in an editorial, said Suga will leave a political vacuum during the coronavirus crisis. The LDP must quickly have its presidential election, it said. The Asahi Shimbun said Suga deserves to be severely criticized for abandoning his responsibility to protect the lives and livelihoods of the people at a time of explosive growth in COVID cases. It should be first pointed out, however, that the LDP, which elected Suga as its head and supported his administration for a year, shares the blame for the current dire situation, the newspaper said. Even though the LDPs popularity is waning, there is little chance of a change for the opposition parties. Japans political analysts believe that the ruling coalition will almost certainly maintain its majority with a new LDP leader, though the party would likely still lose a fair number of seats.
