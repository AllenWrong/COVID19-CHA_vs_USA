Three volunteers are reportedly in good health after being intentionally exposed to the novel coronavirus during the first phase of a controversial United Kingdom COVID trial.The ultimate goal of the socalled human challenge trial is to test vaccines on infected individuals. In this initial stage, researchers are establishing the lowest viral dose needed to cause infection, by administering nasal droplets containing the virus in a range of concentrations.The three participants have recently been released after two weeks in quarantine at the Royal Free Hospital in London, which is hosting the trial in collaboration with biotechnology company hVIVO and Imperial College London.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
