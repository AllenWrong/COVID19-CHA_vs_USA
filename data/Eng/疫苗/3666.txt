Contrary to warnings by Kenyas Ministry of Health and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention that people should observe health protocols during Christmas and New Years festivities, crowds were observed in public places there on Christmas Day as people celebrated without observing social distancing or wearing masks.  Disregard of ministry protocols has raised fears that the virus, which has so far infected more than , people and killed more than , in the East African country, may surge in the next three weeks, even as schools are set for reopening on Jan .  In the port city of Mombasa, the second most affected city amid the coronavirus pandemic after the capital, Nairobi, people thronged public beaches and celebrated as though there was no pandemic, Kenyan epaper Nation reported.  Hundreds gathered at Mama Ngina Waterfront and Jomo Kenyatta and Nyali beaches along with children, forming the largest gatherings since the outbreak in the country began, it said.  The merrymakers mingled freely with their friends and families as they took pictures to capture the moment. Many also had an opportunity to use the newly built Likoni floating bridge, which was open to the public for a few hours.  In Nairobi, many people gathered in public places and shopping malls to mark the holiday.  In rural areas, urban residents who managed to travel mingled freely with family members and held parties without observing social distancing or wearing masks.  There is no way I could avoid shaking the hands of my children whom I last saw a year ago. I, however, hope that none of them had the virus, said Jackson Kiatu, a resident of Kenyas Kitui County.  The Africa CDC had predicted an increase in cases of coronavirus infections across the continent by February due to the Christmas and yearend festivities.  Meanwhile, doctors have resumed their duties after a strike that began on Dec  was called off on Dec , following the signing of an agreement between the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union and the government.  The doctors had gone on strike demanding medical insurance coverage, better pay and better protective equipment. Clinicians and nurses who went on strike on Dec  over similar demands have yet to resume work.  As Kenya worried about a surge in cases, South Africa imposed tough new restrictions a day after its total COVID cases reached  million, the BBC reported.  Under the new restrictions, announced by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, indoor and outdoor gatherings will be banned, a curfew will be in place from  pm until  am, and alcohol sales will be prohibited.  Ramaphosa said the country was at an extremely dangerous point in the pandemic and action had to be taken.  Authorities recently confirmed that a new, fasterspreading coronavirus variant had been detected in South Africa, and some hospitals and medical centers reported a huge rise in admissions, putting a heavy strain on resources, according to the BBC.  In a televised speech, Ramaphosa said that the recent rise in cases was a cause for great alarm and that we have simply let our guard down, the BBC reported.  He added that the new measures, which went into effect on Monday, would last at least until Jan .  The president said gatherings except for funerals and a few other limited exceptions would be banned and all shops, bars and other venues would have to close by  pm.  All alcohol sales were banned, and anyone who fails to wear a mask in public places will face possible fines or imprisonment, Ramaphosa said.  The Africa CDC has said that a survey it conducted in partnership with the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine found that, on average,  percent of respondents in Africa said they would take a COVID vaccine if it were deemed safe and effective.  The survey, conducted between August and December, involved interviews with more than , people age  or older in  African countries, the Africa CDC said in a statement.  Data from the survey indicated significant variations on the willingness across countries and across the five regions on the continent, ranging from  percent in Ethiopia who were willing to get a vaccine and  percent in Niger, to  percent in Senegal and  percent in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  edithmutethyachinadaily.com.cn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
