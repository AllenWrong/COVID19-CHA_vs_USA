US shows no scruples in politicizing pandemic

The US administration under Joe Biden has been proclaiming America is back. But judging by what it is saying and doing, it is simply back to doing what has now become its new normal. By politicizing the pandemic, the worlds sole superpower has made it clear that it has zero intention of joining hands with the rest of the world. Instead, it wants to build cliques on the premise of divide and dominate. With the pandemic outlook remaining grim and more contagious variants of the novel coronavirus spreading in many parts of the world, people need the confidence, hope and spirit inspired by cooperation. Instead, the United States, out of political calculations and bias, has been sabotaging global solidarity in the fight against the virus by politicizing the pandemic and the efforts to trace the origin of the outbreak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
