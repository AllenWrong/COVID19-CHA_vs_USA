Colleges need collaboration to address challenges

I believe that it is a fundamental purpose of universities to serve and challenge our societieslocally, nationally and globally. Our institutions response to these and other issues set the standard for how our wider societies respond to them as well. We must lead by example. But we also serve and challenge society in a much more comprehensivea globalsense. The greatest issues we face are global. And as we have seen recently and dramatically no institution, no country, no matter how seemingly isolated, is immune to events occurring somewhere else on the planet. Whether it is understanding the molecular basis of Alzheimers, or helping governments create more equal and inclusive economic policies, or trying to develop accurate diagnostic tests or vaccines for COVIDwhat we do in universities like Beida and Cambridge affects lives all around the world. It is in this broadest sense that I understand serving and challenging our societies. We are now confronting an extraordinarily complex period in our global politics. The previously recognized frameworks for international relations are no longer accepted. Tensions are rising. In place of the world of bipolar alignments that most of us grew up with, we see the emergence of a world in which overlapping sets of interests require the building of coalitions on an issuebyissue basis. In a world like that, collaboration between states and governments is more difficult to achieve, and harder to sustain. Political tradeoffs become messier and less stable. In a world like that, what we often refer to as Track II diplomacythe informal and unofficial contacts between citizens, organizations and other nonstate actorsbecomes more important than ever. This is something that universities are exceptionally wellplaced to do. In the years ahead, we are likely to see a global escalation of tension in issues ranging from trade to security. And when geopolitics puts international cooperation under strain, it is crucial that academic institutions find ways to continue to work together where values and aspirations can be alignedbecause the global challenges are still there, and they will continue to affect us all. In tackling some of the big issuesfrom COVID to the climate crisiswe need the diversity of backgrounds, of views and of expertise that can only come from equitable, open partnerships. The creation of knowledge is a collaborative enterprise. In a world of diminishing resources, and with challenges of all sorts increasing in complexity and scale, collaboration is imperative. It may become harder with rising political tensions, but we must find ways forward that recognize sometimes significant differences but that seek out ways to partner on great global problems. In a world of growing disharmony, universities must keep alive dialogue, learning and sharing amongst individuals and among peoples. In a world of narrowing horizons and rising disinformation, universities must continue to be a safe environment for the open exchange of ideas and knowledge. This is what universities around the world have done for centuries even in periods of equal and greater political disharmony. I hope we can find a way to do this for centuries to come.
