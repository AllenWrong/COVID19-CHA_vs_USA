Violent crime in the citys subways is unfolding while the Metropolitan Transportation Authority tries to cope with an eightmonth drastic drop in revenue due to reduced ridership from the pandemic and hundreds of thousands of office workers and tourists no longer in the city. Less riders can certainly give way to certain crimes, Edward Delatorre, a former transit police chief, told The New York Times. A barren station or a shutdown could be inviting for certain crimes. On Thursday, a yearold woman was shoved onto the tracks in the Union Square subway station in Manhattan as a train pulled in. She fell between the rails, police said, miraculously sustaining only minor injuries. The suspect, Aditya Vemulapati, , surrendered to a transit worker and was charged with attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment. On Wednesday night, a man was pushed onto the tracks at the nd StreetBryant Park station by another man after the victim refused to give him money, authorities said. The victim was able to pull himself onto the platform. A suspect, Justin Pena, was arrested and charged with attempted murder. Its not fair to the people who are using this system, Sarah Feinberg, NYC Transit interim president, said at a news conference Thursday. Its not fair to the woman who experienced this today. We have a crisis in this city, and it absolutely has to be addressed. This city has a mental health crisis right now, she added. We have got folks in this city who desperately need mental health care. Im desperate for this mayor or the next mayor to take it on because weve got a long way to go. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose second term concludes on Dec , , has blamed the latest increase in crime partly on business and school closures due to the pandemic. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference Sunday that he believes it will take longer to distribute a COVID vaccine, two of which recently were shown to be  percent successful in clinical trials. People say, Dont worry, theres a vaccine. I will wager you dollars for doughnuts, its six months at a minimum before you hit critical mass with a vaccine, he said. New York City had a . percent positive coronavirus test rate as of Sunday afternoon, according to the city Health Department. The city has suffered , deaths attributed to COVID. Its almost like a perfect storm, Alfred Titus Jr, an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former NYPD homicide detective, told Fox News. We had bail reform, then defunding the police, which cut the amount of officers on the streets and the overtime that could be made, and now we have COVID. The Police Benevolent Association and the Sergeants Benevolent Association SBA accused local politicians of tying the hands of police. Union leaders also mentioned cuts in the police budget and bail reform laws that make it easier for those charged with crimes to quickly return to the streets. The City Council pretty much took away the ability of the NYPD to make arrests, SBA President Ed Mullins told Fox News. We have cops out there right now that are hesitant to grab anybody simply out of fear that if it goes bad, we may get ourselves arrested. Following protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May , the NYPD disbanded its plainclothes units. The NYPD also reassigned officers from homeless outreach to focus on gun crime.
