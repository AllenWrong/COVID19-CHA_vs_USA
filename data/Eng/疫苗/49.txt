There are different reasons why that may be the case, but the trend is unmistakable.Rich Lakin, immunization director of the Utah Department of Health, told the Deseret News that he is sure there is some confusion around the booster jabs, adding that its important for people to read up on the booster shots to make sure theyre eligible for it.
