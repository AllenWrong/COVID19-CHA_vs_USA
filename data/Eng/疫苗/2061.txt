Waiving patent protections seen as way to boost global supplies                                            US Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Wednesday restated the Joe Biden administrations position on Wednesday during talks at the World Trade Organization on support for the temporary waiver of protections that would allow more manufacturers to produce COVID vaccines, but opponents call the move no panacea to the pandemic.US President Joe Biden earlier on Wednesday said that he supported the waiver, which has been pursued by more than  countries.The WTOs General Council took up the issue of a temporary waiver in October. The idea has gained support among some progressive lawmakers in the West. A group of  Democratic members of Congress sent Biden a letter last month calling on him to support the waiver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
