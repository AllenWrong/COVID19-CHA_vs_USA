An enormous grin spreads across her face. A photo of a girl with the bright smile holding a vial of Sinovac Biotechs CoronaVac has become the focus of international media. As more countries embrace Chinese vaccines to fight COVID, I feel deeply honored that I photographed the girl and that photo has been published widely in the media. On June , , I was on a mission to photograph one of Sinovac Biotechs laboratory in Beijings Shangdi area. Over the past two decades, the company has developed and commercialized six humanused vaccines and one animal vaccine, and advanced its RD pipeline. During the filming, one of the personnel at Sinovac Biotech took out a novel coronavirus model and several vials of vaccines from his bag, and said that they could be used as props in my photos. I took the vaccine with a doubtful look, carefully examined it and said excitedly This is the real vaccine, the one that can be vaccinated? Yes, it has reached the secondphase clinical trial, the man said. After disinfection, we brought the flashlight into the laboratory for lighting and metering. And then we took a few photographs of their staff, but I couldnt help thinking that there was something missing. At that very moment, a girl with an attractive smile came from outside, and upon asking I learned that the girl Li Yuexian is also a staff member of the laboratory. We invited her to work as a temporary model for the filming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
