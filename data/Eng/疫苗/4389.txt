Speaking via video link at the third LancangMekong Cooperation leaders meeting, Li announced steps to share hydrological data on the upper reaches of the river, known as Lancang in China, throughout the year to help nations along the river better cope with climate change and natural disasters. Drinking water from the same river, we, the LMC countries, are close as one family living in a community with a shared future. Enhancing mutually beneficial cooperation is both conducive to our own interests and contributes to others success, Li said. China will set up a special fund for public health under the LMC Special Fund, he said, and continue to provide material and technical support to Mekong countries to the best of its ability. Chinas COVID vaccines, once developed and put to commercial use, will be provided to Mekong countries on a priority basis, he said.

Zhai Kun, a professor of Southeast Asian studies at Peking University, said Beijing has responded to the appeal from the Mekong River countries in its decision to share the hydrological data for the year. That will lay the foundation for the future exploration of the rivers water resources, he said. The establishment of a special fund for public health will help Mekong River countries boost their public health systems and secure victories during the COVID pandemic, he said.
