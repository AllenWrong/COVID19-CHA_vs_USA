ISTANBULAt a privately owned clinic in Istanbul, a physician removed a bandage with exceptional care to reveal rows of tiny dotted red wounds on his patients head. Then, he gently cleaned the dried blood. It hasnt even been  hours since the operation, but the result already looks perfect, said Servet Terziler, a hair transplant specialist. Alberto Bolos Sanchez, a yearold Spanish man, also seemed satisfied with the result after Terziler showed him the new hair follicles transplanted onto a bald area on his head.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
