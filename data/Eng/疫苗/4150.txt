Jeremy Farrar, a member of the governments Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies and a former professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford, told Sky News I think in the first quarter of next year we will have vaccineswell have more than one vaccine. Farrar, who is director of the research charity Wellcome Trust, said several good vaccine candidates are being developed and data about the trials for some of them will be available next month and in December. Vaccines come in all different styles and approaches and Britain has got a portfolio of vaccines, through which more than one, Im sure, will come through in the first quarter of next year, he said, adding that better treatments will also improve the prognosis of people with the disease. His comments echoed those of Jonathan VanTam, Englands deputy chief medical officer, who said he expects to see vaccines in the UK at the start of . But people are being urged in the meantime to avoid the virus by wearing face coverings, regularly washing hands, and maintaining social distancing. These steps that are being encouraged through a raft of new measures introduced and reintroduced around Europe in recent days. Businesses warning In the UK, the latest restrictions on gatherings have led businesses to warn of catastrophic consequences, including mass redundancies and company failures. The British Chambers of Commerce, which represents , UK companies, told the BBC additional support will be needed beyond the billionpound  billion package the government has put in place. Adam Marshall, the chambers directorgeneral, wrote in an open letter to the government The situation for business grows graver by the day. Enhanced support must be given to those facing the indirect impacts of restrictions and closuresin supply chains, tourist destinations, and town and city centers. The UK has recently introduced a threetier system that directs the strictest restrictions at regions with the highest rates of virus transmission, although it has proven difficult to implement because of resistance from some parts of the country. Robert Jenrick, the UKs local government minister, said on Monday the government will offer additional resources to the local government in the Greater Manchester area in a bid to gain its support. We want to put together a package of measures that would actually work, that will support people on the ground who are doing such great work and above all bear down on the virus, Jenrick told Sky News. The Financial Times said the government is likely to offer disgruntled local governments greater control over the contacttracing system, and offer the use of the armed forces.
