Although only one local novel coronavirus infection was reported on Saturday, along with  imported cases, the vaccination plan unveiled by the State Council, the countrys Cabinet, that day has still triggered a nationwide sense of relief and expectancy.Although the virus has been tamed for months in the country, it has never been free of the threat of its resurgence, as the number of imported infections has been on a sharp increase with the worsening of the pandemic overseas, and local infections have appeared in various parts of the country since the end of the national day holiday on Oct , when the country had not seen local infections over the previous consecutive  days. The sources of some of these domestic infections remain unknown.Were it not for the prompt actions taken by local authorities, the strict screening at customs and the pandemic measures normalized in the society, it would have been all too easy for the virus to stage a comeback. But clearly, there are some people, such as medical workers, who face higher risks of being infected. Thats why it is necessary, as the vaccination plan indicates, for those doing certain jobs to be inoculated first, so that they are better protected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
