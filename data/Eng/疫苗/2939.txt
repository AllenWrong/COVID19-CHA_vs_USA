The rollout of the vaccination program is the biggest gamechanger in the containment of the virus, according to her. We believe that as we all follow what is happening in other countries, we can testify that with the vaccines, we are going to see a dramatic decrease in the transmission of cases, in the recorded severe cases, and in the number of people that will require hospitalization and surely decrease from the number of people dying from COVID, Sarpong said. Ghana reported its first two cases of COVID in March . For almost a year, the Greater Accra Region has accounted for around  percent of all recorded cases in the country. Some  million Ghanaians are expected to be vaccinated against the virus during the countrys vaccination drive, which will run through October.
