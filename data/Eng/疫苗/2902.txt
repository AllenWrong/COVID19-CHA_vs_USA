The past year was very difficult for everyone, including China. But, thanks to its high mobilization capabilities, China was able to quickly stop the spread of COVID on its territory, and when the epidemic became global, it began to help other states, including Ukraine, Oleksiy Koval, a member of the Ukrainian Association of Sinologists, told Xinhua. China has extended help to others in various manners, including providing personal protective equipment, test systems and medical equipment, organizing online conferences for medics to exchange experience and sending medical teams to countries in need, the expert noted.

According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, China has provided vaccine assistance to  developing countries in need, and exported vaccines to  countries. It has also decided to provide  million vaccine doses to multilateral vaccine alliance COVAX backed by the World Health Organization to meet the urgent needs of developing countries.
