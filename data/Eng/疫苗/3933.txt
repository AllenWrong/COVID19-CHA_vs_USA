Forecasts of quick economic rebound come amid supportive policies                     Chinas economic growth is expected to recover strongly next year, driven by consumption, manufacturing investment and resilient exports, according to forecasts by leading international financial groups, as the countrys top policymakers formulate a new development paradigm to better facilitate stable and highquality growth.  Projections for the GDP growth of the worlds secondlargest economy in  range from . percent to  percent, the fastest pace since at least . This comes after the introduction of supportive policies, including monetary and fiscal measures, that were launched at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in the nation.  The positive views on the prospects for Chinas economy come as policymakers in Beijing have drawn up the dual circulation development paradigm with the domestic market being the mainstay and the domestic and international markets supporting each other.  The new development pattern is an active choice by China to better adapt to the changing and evolving development stage of the Chinese economy, and a strategic move by China to respond to the complex and challenging international environment, VicePremier Liu He wrote in a Peoples Daily article published on Wednesday.  Liu said that the dual circulation model is crucial for China to raise its economic selfsufficiency and sustainability, boost the resilience of the economy and maintain stable and healthy growth.  Chinas timely and forwardlooking policy adjustment has helped strengthen confidence in the worlds secondlargest economy despite the COVID pandemic posing serious challenges to the global economy and international industrial chains.  US investment bank Goldman Sachs predicted that Chinas GDP growth, on a yearly basis, is likely to rebound to . percent in , up from a projection of  percent this year. The recovery will be mainly driven by household consumption and manufacturing investment. Its exports, in the meantime, are expected to remain resilient, it said.  Last week, another USbased investment bank, Morgan Stanley, offered a more positive forecast for Chinas  GDP growth of  percent, led by a strong recovery in private consumption and global demand, with policy stimulus being phased out.  While the Chinese economy is expected to be on a stable path of recovery, economists expect that Chinas monetary and fiscal policies are likely to gradually normalize.  The view was backed by the recent rise of the interbank markets sevenday repo rate, a gauge of the prices of loans borrowed between commercial banks, which has mostly returned to prepandemic levels. Credit growth has also slowed from the peak in the MarchtoMay period.  In China, monetary and credit policies have already been normalizing, Shan Hui, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs, told China Daily.  Looking into the near future, Shan said that Chinas policy rates are likely to remain stable, while credit growth may decelerate further.  In terms of fiscal policy, the Goldman Sachs economist predicted the governments onbudget fiscal deficit would narrow from . percent of GDP this year to  percent in , although local governments maturing bonds and refinancing demand are likely to pick up next year.  We may see more refinancing bond issuance by local governments and some of the financing gap may be plugged by transfers from the central government, Shan said. At the same time, a cyclical upturn is helpful for government revenues and local governments have been asked to cut spending when possible.  Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, said that private consumption could emerge as the key growth driver in the coming months, with a release of excess savings of Chinese residents and the overall recovery of the domestic job market.  Stronger global demand and reduced risks of trade tensions would boost manufacturing investment, outweighing slower construction activity and a slightly narrowed surplus of trade in goods and services, according to Xing.  Policymakers will likely normalize credit growth and the fiscal stance in  with a full recovery in the labor market and the deployment of COVID vaccines in major economies, he added.  Economists also predicted that the normalization of Chinas monetary and fiscal policies will further elevate the interest rate differential between China and the United States, which will be one of the drivers of a further appreciation of the renminbi and stronger foreign exchange inflows into China next year.  But other major economies are likely to maintain monetary easing and fiscal stimulus to tackle the COVID shocks. The US and European Union central banks may also reraise their policy rates as early as , Goldman Sachs economists said.
