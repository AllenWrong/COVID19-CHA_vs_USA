PhotoAgencies    LONDON  A medical scientist has expressed objection to US host Jon Stewarts comments alleging the novel coronavirus accidentally leaked from a lab, according to a report on British online newspaper The Independent. I will say this  and I honestly mean this I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to science, Stewart made the remarks on Stephen Colberts Late Show on Wednesday. Science has, in many ways, helped ease the suffering of this pandemic, which was more than likely caused by science. Speaking to TMZ Live, Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and codirector of the Texas Childrens Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, urged Stewart and others to be more prudent when discussing the potential origin of COVID, said the article published on Wednesday. Theyre putting the entertainment value of this above whats reality, Hotez noted. It causes a lot of damage because a number of scientists who work on coronaviruses including myself feel that were under attack right now.
