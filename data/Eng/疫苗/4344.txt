2020-09-04 00:00
The World Health Organization, through UNICEF Somalia, has started a vaccination campaign in southeastern Somalias Banadir administrative region in which , children would be vaccinated against polio and measles. The program has been launched at a time health workers had paused other regular and planned activities such as the integrated polio and measles campaign, as they worked to prevent the spread of COVID and provide muchneeded treatment for infected people. UNICEF Somalia said that health workers will also offer children vitamin A and deworming tablets at fixed and outreach sites. According to Asma Ali, acting head of WHOs Polio Program in Somalia, health workers will observe comprehensive COVID infection prevention measures, such as regular handwashing and wearing face masks to keep families safe. In addition, health workers will share information with families on how to prevent further spread of COVID. This campaign in Banadir was supposed to take place in November last year, following a similar intervention in the rest of the country, but was postponed to  due to some technical delays. Unfortunately, COVID came about and took over. Thankfully, we now have a chance to continue to boost the immunity of so many young children again, Ali said. After four years without a single case of wild polio, the African region was certified free of wild polio virus. The announcement was made at a virtual session of the th WHO Regional Committee for Africa. Penelope Campbell, chief of health at UNICEF Somalia, said as the COVID response continues, it is critical that immunization drives are sustained at the same time. Measles and polio are vaccinepreventable diseases and through this campaign, we can stop the further spread of these outbreaks and save the lives of countless children, Campbell said. Campbell added that since the start of the year,  children in Banadir have reportedly been infected with measles, accounting for around half of the total cases in the country. She added that this highly contagious infectious disease can cause fever and rashes among other symptoms in unvaccinated children. Mamunur Malik, WHO Somalia representative, emphasized to Somali communities that every adult has a responsibility to help Somali children lead healthy lives. I would like to encourage parents, caregivers and all adults in Banadir and surrounding areas to make the most of this opportunity and visit vaccination sites to ensure every child aged under five is vaccinated against polio and measles, and that every child receives additional supplements to keep them healthy. As caregivers we all have an obligation to ensure our children lead healthy and productive lives, Malik said. otiatochinadaily.com.cn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
