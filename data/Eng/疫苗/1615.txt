G wastes opportunity to help others

The leaders of the G wealthy nations pledged during their weekend summit in the United Kingdom to share more than  billion COVID vaccines with the worlds lowincome countries over next year.  But given that right now, the virus is moving faster than the global vaccine distribution, as DirectorGeneral of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus put it and that the WHO estimates  billion doses are needed if at least  percent of the worlds population is to be vaccinated by next year to achieve herd immunity against the virus, the groups pledge seems too little.  Not to mention the fact that the imbalance between the G and lowincome countries in terms of doses administered stands at  to , according to the World Bank, accentuating the moral failure of the rich countries to stand by the poorer nations amid this global health crisis.  Since COVID started raging across the world, the way the rich countries have dealt with global vaccine distribution has been egregious. Even UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted during the summit that the selfish and nationalistic approaches by some countries had marred the initial global response to the COVID pandemic.  As a result, the world is experiencing astonishing vaccine inequality. Of the . billion vaccines given around the world, only  percent has been administered in Africa. While the G nations have secured enough vaccines for every one of their citizens to be vaccinated three times over, according to the WHO.  The United States, which has plentiful doses, has an evergrowing surplus of coronavirus vaccines. Millions of Johnson  Johnson vaccines are reportedly set to expire this month.  Moreover, the WHO is still facing a funding gap of  billion to speed up production and access to COVID diagnostics, treatment and vaccines. That figure represents less than  percent of the annual global defense expenditure, yet this issue went unanswered during the G Summit.  All this makes it selfevident that the collective step taken by the G to address the urgent need of the developing world for vaccine doses is more symbolic than substantial. As former UK prime minister Gordon Brown said, the summit was a missed opportunity, as more should have been done by the worlds most powerful nations in the face of this onceinageneration pandemic.  Countries must drop their differences and work together to ensure the global access to vaccines, tests and treatments for everyone who needs them. There will be no way out if the world remains split into vaccine haves and havenots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
