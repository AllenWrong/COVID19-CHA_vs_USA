Fund says the countrys growth can help the world advance in the face of the pandemic                     With its rapid return to growth, China could hasten the worlds economic recovery by increasing access to a coronavirus vaccine, offering debt relief and advancing global infrastructure investment, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.  Confirming that the GDP of the worlds secondlargest economy is projected to grow . percent in  and . percent in , the IMF, as it also stated last month, highlighted the role of China in helping to overcome several of the major challenges facing the global economy, which it forecast to contract by . percent this year.  This includes supporting international efforts to expand access to a vaccine, providing debt relief to lowincome countries and sustainable financing for global infrastructure investment, and tackling climate change, the fund said at the conclusion of its socalled Article IV Mission consultation with China.  Early last month, China officially joined the COVAX, an international initiative aimed at ensuring equitable global access to COVID vaccines, becoming the largest economy to support the initiative so far, according to earlier media reports.  The IMF conducts Article IV Mission consultations with its members annually. An IMF team of economists visits a country and discusses with government and central bank officials how to assess a members economic health and to forestall future financial problems.  This years tour was done virtually due to the COVID pandemic, which has prompted new lockdowns in many parts of the world and has resulted in the worst global downturn in decades.  The COVID pandemic has inflicted significant human and economic costs on China, but a major containment effort has helped contain the spread of the virus, and macroeconomic and financial policies have mitigated the crisis impact and quickly returned the economy to growth, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Geoffrey Okamoto said.  Despite the pandemic, important reforms have continued in China, including steps to further open the financial sector, advance householdregistration reform and improve intellectual property protection, Okamoto said in an endofmission release.  Chinas GDP grew by . percent yearonyear in the third quarter, faster than the . percent expansion between April and June. This suggested a rapid return to the preCOVID trend, according to US economist Stephen Roach, a former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia.  During the Article IV Mission, Okamoto held virtual meetings with Peoples Bank of China Governor Yi Gang and other officials to discuss the countrys policy mix to secure balanced growth against the headwinds from the global pandemic.  While the recovery is advancing, growth remains unbalanced as it relies heavily on public support while private consumption is lagging, said Okamoto, cautioning that Chinas outlook faces downside risks, stemming from rising financial vulnerabilities and the increasingly challenging external environment.  To secure a balanced recovery, macroeconomic policies need to remain supportive and their effectiveness enhanced, with fiscal policy staying slightly expansionary and shifting from spending on infrastructure toward strengthening social safety nets and promoting green investment, the IMF said in its release.  It also said China and its trading partners should work together to build a more open, stable and transparent rulesbased international trade and investment system.  The member lenders latest assessment seems to match the development trends in China, which has pledged to further open up and ramp up support for economic globalization.  Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a video speech at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai on Wednesday, called on all countries to safeguard the multilateral trading system, improve the rules of global economic governance and build an open world economy.  Our aim is to turn the Chinese market into a market for the world, a market shared by all and a market accessible to all, Xi said. This way, we will be able to bring more positive energy to the global community.  Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Washingtonbased Peterson Institute for International Economics and an expert on the Chinese economy, said China has substantially liberalized access by foreign firms to its immense domestic financial market and is now an increasingly important destination for foreign portfolio investment.  Chinese regulators have allowed multiple securities, asset management, insurance and other financial firms from the United States, Europe and Japan to convert existing minority positions in joint ventures with Chinese partners to majority foreignowned firms and have licensed a number of new wholly foreignowned financial firms, Lardy noted in an analysis.  IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in midOctober that Chinas growth momentum is important for countries that are connected to the Chinese economy through global value chains, where demand from China is an engine for growth.  Chinese imports rose . percent yearonyear in the third quarter of , according to the customs statistics.  huanxinzhaochinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
