Schools across England will reopen on March  as part of the governments socalled roadmap out of lockdown, which aims to have something like normal life back again for the whole of the United Kingdom by early summer.Speaking in the House of Commons on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the measures a oneway road to freedom.Scientific evidence, he said, shows we cannot escape the fact that lifting lockdown will result in more cases, more hospitalizations and sadly, more deaths and this would happen whenever a lockdown is lifted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
