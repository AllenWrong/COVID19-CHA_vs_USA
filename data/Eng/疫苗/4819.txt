UK moves ahead on developing vaccine, ventilator

British scientists this week provided two promising contributions to the fight against the novel coronavirus, as Imperial College London announced it is moving its vaccine into human trials and Cambridge University researchers released the open source design for a cheap ventilator. Drug designers at Imperial College London said their COVID vaccine will enter human testing in June, after the lab received . million pounds . million in fresh funding from the United Kingdom Research and Innovation agency and the National Institute for Health Research. Early findings have shown that animals given the vaccine are able to produce neutralizing antibodies. The next step will be to show that our vaccine is tolerated in humans and whether it can produce the same promising immune response weve seen in our animal studies, said project leader Robin Shattock from the universitys Department of Infectious Disease. In a separate study, Cambridge engineers hope to ease shortages of ventilators in lowand middleincome countries with a machine that can be constructed using readily available parts for a fraction of the cost of conventional designs. Ventilators are essential to hospitals dealing with COVID patients. This is because severe cases of the disease can cause damage to the lungs, making it hard for patients to breathe without the assistance of a machine. Many developing countries, including several in Africa, have a severe shortage of ventilators. An example is Mali, a nation of  million people with just  ventilators across all public and private hospitals. Cambridge has partnered on the Open Ventilator System Initiative, or OVSI, with a consortium of academics, engineers, intensive care medics, and industry partners in the UK and Africa. The OVSI ventilator can be assembled using components that are readily available to manufacturers in most nations, meaning that machines can be repaired easily if parts from the initial assembly kit need to be replaced. The engineers also made sure to use inexpensive parts when designing the machine. The Cambridge team estimates that the OVSI design can be assembled at around onetenth the cost of a conventional ventilator. Its often the case that those living on less than  per day are excluded from the innovation process, said Lara Allen, chief executive of the Centre for Global Equality, an international development network that partnered on the project. As a result, many wellmeaning innovations are not what is needed or wanted by the intended beneficiaries and end up not being used. angusmail.chinadailyuk.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
