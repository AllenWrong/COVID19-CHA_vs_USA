Two delegates tested positive so the entire delegation is now self isolating, a British official said. The meeting had been enabled by a strict set of COVID protocols, including daily testing of all delegates, the British official said. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar did not test positive for the virus, Sky News reporter Joe Pike said on Twitter. Jaishankar was pictured meeting British interior minister Priti Patel on Tuesday. The delegation will be attempting to meet virtually, Pike added.
