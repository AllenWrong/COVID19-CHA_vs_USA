It aims to provide  billion doses by the end of the year. China has also supplied over  million doses of vaccines to COVAX, and donated  million to the World Health Organization plan. It has colaunched the Belt and Road vaccine cooperation partnership initiative with  countries, and has organized joint COVID vaccine production with  developing countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
