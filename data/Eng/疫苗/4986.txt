Researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia have begun testing a vaccine for the novel coronavirusnamed COVID by the World Health Organizationon animals, with human clinical studies expected in July.For researchers around the world it is a race against time to find a vaccine for the deadly virus. Since the outbreak was first detected in Wuhan, researchers in China and in several other centers around the world have been working to find a vaccine.According to the university, researchers in China were quick to pass on data about the virus sequence. That gave us the viral genome we needed, said doctor Paul Young, head of the universitys School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
