PhotoAgencies    NEW YORK  Inoculations against COVID have reached  billion as the world races to contain the pandemic, but at the current pace, it will take nine more months to vaccinate  percent of the global population needed to provide herd immunity, Bloomberg said in a recent report. The vaccination rollout has been uneven, mainly benefiting the developed world while lowerincome countries have struggled to source shots. The wealthiest  countries have administered about  percent of vaccinations globally but have only  percent of the worlds population, said the report. The United States and Britain led the way with vaccinations early, China has given the most doses and European Union members have been catching up after a slow start, according to Bloombergs Vaccine Tracker. China now accounts for about twothirds of the roughly  million shots given daily. The EU is administering the secondhighest number, with about . million doses daily, followed by India with . million. In the United States, . doses have been administered for every  people. That compares with a global average of  doses per  people, said the report. Although  billion doses would be equivalent to more than a quarter of the worlds population, the proportion immunized is well below that level because most of the vaccines in use require two shots to be fully effective, and some people have received only one. The virus has stricken almost  million people and killed close to . million since the first cases emerged.
