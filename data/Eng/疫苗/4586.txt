ChinaEU videoconference a continuation of intense communication amid outbreak                     As the nd ChinaEuropean Union leaders meeting is set to be held via videoconference on Monday, observers said the two major global players could use the first official meeting between Chinese leaders and the new EU leadership to forge an even closer relationship amid the COVID pandemic.  President Xi Jinping will meet with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen via video link. Premier Li Keqiang will cochair the virtual meeting with Michel and von der Leyen.  The meeting, which was scheduled to be held in Beijing in March but postponed due to the COVID pandemic, comes as China and the EU commemorate the th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year. It also takes place amid intensive communication and cooperation between China and EU members since the novel coronavirus outbreak began.  Xi has maintained good communication with leaders of European countries through telephone talks or correspondence in recent months.  In a phone conversation on June  with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country will take over the EUs rotating presidency in the second half of this year, Xi reaffirmed Chinas commitment to stepping up the planned political agenda it has with Germany and the EU.  He said China stands ready to strengthen strategic cooperation with the EU in upholding multilateralism, tackling global challenges and providing certainty to an uncertain world, and taking the relationship to new levels. Xi also expressed similar views in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on June .  Feng Zhongping, vicepresident of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said the intensive interaction between China and the EU has sent an important message that cooperation remains the overarching principle in their ties despite differences.  This message is crucially important not only to bilateral relations, but also to the recovery of the world economy in the postCOVID period, Feng said.  The pandemic has brought China and Europe closer together, which has been demonstrated by the mutual support and aid between China and the EU and its members. They are stepping up cooperation on diagnostics, treatment, pharmaceuticals and vaccine development, as well as regular exchanges of information and expertise.  China recently launched a fasttrack service for personnel exchanges with Germany and several other countries to facilitate business cooperation and the reopening of economic activity and to ensure industrial and supply chains remain secure and stable.  During the th round of ChinaEU highlevel strategic dialogue held via video link on June , State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed that China and the EU are longterm comprehensive strategic partners, not systemic rivals.  Speaking of the  years of diplomatic ties, Wang said China and the EU enjoy more cooperation than competition, and more common understanding than disagreement.  Ding Chun, director of the Center for European Studies at Fudan University, said the EU is reassessing the world and its position and policy, including relations with China, given the challenges posed to the EUs battered economy by the pandemic, rising populism in some member states, the quitting of the global system by the United States, growing tension between China and the US, and the narrowing economic and technological gap between China and the EU.  In such a complex situation, the nd ChinaEU leaders meeting could not come at a better time indeepening mutual understanding and pursuing mutually beneficial winwin cooperation, he said.  The EU leadership has said it does not want to have to choose sides between China and the US, but instead would use its own interests and values as a compass.  China is playing an evergrowing role in global politics, and we have great interest in working together on many issues where its role is essential, from pandemic recovery to climate change and sustainable connectivity, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell wrote in a blog last week. All this and more forms a big, positive agenda for EUChina cooperation.  Borrell said the EU also wants to work with China on issues in which they have not reached agreement, but where negotiations can produce good outcomes for both sides.  Merkel last year proposed a summit between top leaders from China and all EU member states to be held in Leipzig in September during Germanys EU presidency.  She had hoped that China and the EU could wrap up their negotiations on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment before the summit, but the Leipzig meeting is now postponed due to COVID.  Experts said the ChinaEU agreement on investment is also expected to be a major topic at Mondays virtual meeting.  Zhang Ming, head of the Chinese Mission to the EU, said on Thursday that Chinas political commitment to concluding a highlevel and balanced investment agreement will not change despite the postponement of the Leipzig summit.  While the EU expects more market access to China, Beijing has voiced deep concerns over the EUs moves to step up scrutiny of foreign investment, especially from China.  In terms of the international landscape, both China and the EU welcome a multipolar world, support economic globalization and seek greater democracy in international relations.  Shada Islam, former director of Europe and geopolitics at Friends of Europe, a Brusselsbased think tank, said, Both China and the EU must reiterate their commitment to multilateralism and maintaining free trade.
