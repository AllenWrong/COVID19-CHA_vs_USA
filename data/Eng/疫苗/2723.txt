Hong Kongs vaccination drive is the best pathway to normalcy

The coronavirus cluster at the upscale Sai Ying Pun gym could not probably come at a worse time. By the time the cluster unfolded, emerging after a yearold fitness instructor at Ursus Fitness was confirmed as infected on March , confusion was already reigning supreme regarding the safety of the Sinovac COVID vaccine. There were some medical emergencies and subsequent deaths involving people who received the shots. Medical experts quickly denied any direct link, but this still sent people panicking. Why not? People are already on their nerves and fatigued to the core with one year of maintaining caution and social distancing.       As some European countries suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine following reports of bloodclotting in some jab takers, Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said We cant allow any doubts about the vaccine. We have to make sure everything is right, so it is wise to pause for now. While a large number of people are being vaccinated at pace around the world, some of them will still get sick with things not linked to the vaccine. It is right to question whether the shot might have contributed in any way. And it is the responsibility of the health authorities to address confusion and gain public trust. What could bring the mercury down would be better guidance on the side effects and convincing people about the absence of any link between the deaths and the jabs. Seems that didnt happen effectively here in Hong Kong. Following the first two deaths, health officials statements saying that those were not directly linked with the Sinovac vaccine came relatively quickly. But then five more people died after taking the shots and it was not until March  when experts with Hong Kongs Expert Committee on Clinical Events Assessment said no direct link was established between the shots and the deaths. The seven and one seriously ill patient were all suffering from severe coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and pulmonary edema, they said. Brought to their knees, nations across the world are striving to inoculate themselves against the novel coronavirus, everyone realizing fully well that no country can be safe until all countries are safe from the virus. Hence the race to grab vaccine shots. Though late to launch the campaign, officially on Feb , Hong Kong at first had only one vaccine to offer  Sinovacs CoronaVac  and enthusiasm to register for this was encouraging at first. But with the confusion heavily denting peoples trust in the vaccine, the enthusiasm took a hit. The takeup rate for CoronaVac continued to fluctuate. The introduction of BioNTechs Comirnaty shot offered an option for those doubtful about Sinovacs efficacy and safety. As of Saturday night, around , people had received COVID shots, with about , receiving their first dose of the Sinovac vaccine while about , their first dose of the BioNTech jab, according to the SAR government. Bookings surged after inclusion of all residents aged  and above, making . million people eligible for shots. Guidelines have been issued on who should not get inoculated. On Thursday, the Hong Kong government said there was no evidence that called for doubting the safety of the two COVID vaccines currently available in the city. Clinical trial statistics of the Sinovac vaccine suggested that, so far, there was no evidence indicating a direct causal relationship between receiving the vaccine and adverse events such as deaths, it said. Some experts said it would be better had it come sooner. Also, there remains the need for a bettercoordinated response to counter prejudice and misinformation about postvaccination deaths. I remember how experts dismissed the concern over the  postPfizerBioNTech vaccine deaths in Norway. If citizens do not take mandatory testing as requested, do not get jabs as encouraged, and do not wear masks and comply with socialdistancing measures, people will be endlessly trapped in a phase of chasing, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuetngor warned on Wednesday. Her announcement the same day of incentivizing people to be vaccinated could well boost the citys inoculation campaign. We are now considering offering incentives not only in aspects of crossborder travel, but also room to relax socialdistancing measures for those who have been vaccinated, she said, revealing that her government had initiated talks with mainland authorities over resuming crossborder travel. After the announcement, I scanned through news readers comments on different platforms. While theres no doubt people would welcome it, an overwhelming majority of them said the first step the government should take is to waive the quarantine requirement for those with vaccine passes  especially those coming in. Some health experts in Hong Kong opined that the authorities should consider allowing those vaccinated to gather in groups of , for example, in restaurants or other public places. Other suggestions include reopening places like saunas and mahjong parlors and premises like nightclubs for such people. Incentives are definitely welcome. But the authorities should strive to lift peoples confidence to boost the takeup rate. Otherwise not enough people will be vaccinated. We should all remember that at least  percent of the citys population has to be vaccinated to achieveherd immunity, which is our pathway back to normal.
