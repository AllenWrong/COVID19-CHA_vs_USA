The situation of the battle against the virus has changed deeply, and the pandemic will get worse if no immediate prevention and control measures are taken. The severity and duration of a pandemic depends on three factors First, the characteristics of the virus. These refer to the incubation period, infectivity, lethality, mutation and longevity of the virus, which cannot be changed. Second, the fundamental conditions of each country and the world. These include the capability of mobilization and coordination, the effectiveness of disease control systems, the response capability of medical systems, economic strength, the capability of medical prevention and control supply and the development and research of medicines and vaccines. All of the above are developed over a long period. Except for medicines and vaccine research and development, no factors are profitable when comparing output with input. Third, the activity capability of each country and the world. This refers to risk awareness, judgment of a crisis, time before acting and solutions by leaders, prevention and control plans, medical care plans, behaviors of a government and its people during the disease and cooperation domestically and internationally. This is something we can affect and control and should deserve the utmost effort. However, governments and the public in some countries are remaining misinformed in some areas, and misinformation will definitely make the pandemic worse.
