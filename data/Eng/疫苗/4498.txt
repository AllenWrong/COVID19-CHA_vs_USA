Mans best friend could soon join fight against pandemic                                             In a pristine, sunlit training room, Digby walked slowly and methodically around a strange circular contraptiona sort of metal carousel formed from a series of spokes with cups on the end. The labradoodle, generally a sociable and playful companion, was on a mission. There were eight cups to choose from, but only one would result in a treat and lavish praise from his trainer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
