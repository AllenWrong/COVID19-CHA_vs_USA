GENEVA  The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD said Monday that foreign direct investment FDI flows plunged globally by  percent in  due to the COVID pandemic, but are expected to bottom out in  mainly thanks to the recovery in Asia.In its World Investment Report , the Genevabased UN trade and development body said FDI flows fell to  trillion in  from . trillion the previous year.Lockdowns caused by the COVID pandemic around the world slowed down existing investment projects, and the prospects of a recession led multinational enterprises to reassess new projects, the report said.UNCTAD said that in developing countries, the number of newly announced greenfield projects fell by  percent and international project finance deals, which are important for infrastructure, declined by  percent.These investment types are crucial for productive capacity and infrastructure development and thus for sustainable recovery prospects, Acting UNCTAD SecretaryGeneral Isabelle Durant said.The UNCTAD also said that COVID caused a collapse in investment flows to sectors relevant for the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs in developing countries.The drop in foreign investment in SDGrelated sectors may reverse the progress achieved in SDG investment in recent years, posing a risk to delivering the  Agenda for Sustainable Development and to sustained postpandemic recovery, Durant warned.RESILIENCE IN ASIAOn the bright side, the figures showed that flows to developing countries in Asia increased by  percent to  billion in , reflecting resilience amid the global contraction.Despite the pandemic, FDI to and from the region remained resilient in . Developing Asia is the only region recording FDI growth, accounting for more than half of global inward and outward FDI flows, said UNCTADs director of investment and enterprise, James Zhan.FDI prospects in  for Asia are more favourable than the global average, because of recovery in trade, manufacturing activities and a strong GDP growth forecast, he added.In China, FDI growth picked up pace in  and grew by  percent to  billion.UNCTAD said this was reflected by the countrys success in containing the pandemic and its rapid GDP growth recovery. Growth was driven by technologyrelated industries, ecommerce and research and development, it added.BOTTOMING OUT LIKELYThe UNCTAD forecast global FDI flows to bottom out in  and recover some lost ground with an increase of  to  percent.This would still leave FDI some  percent below the  level. Current forecasts show a further increase in  which, at the upper bound of projections, bring FDI back to the  level, Zhan said.The report said that prospects are highly uncertain and will depend on the pace of economic recovery and the possibility of pandemic relapses, the potential impact of recovery spending packages on FDI, as well as policy pressures.The relatively modest recovery also reflects the lingering uncertainty about access to vaccines, the emergence of virus mutations and the reopening of economic sectors.Increased expenditures on both fixed assets and intangibles will not translate directly into a rapid FDI rebound, as confirmed by the sharp contrast between rosy forecasts for capex capital expenditures and stilldepressed greenfield project announcements, Zhan said.
