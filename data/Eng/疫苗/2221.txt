BRUSSELSThe European Medicines Agency, or EMA, said on Tuesday it found a possible link between the Johnson  Johnson COVID vaccine and cases of blood clots, but insisted the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks.A careful review of the cases and other available evidence has led us to affirm that these blood clotting disorders are very rare side effects of the vaccine, Sabine Straus, president of the EMAs safety committee, said at a news conference.The medicines watchdog of the European Union was informed on April  of eight serious cases of unusual blood clots associated with low levels of blood platelets, one of which had a fatal outcome. All the cases occurred in the United States, where over seven million people received the JJ vaccine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
