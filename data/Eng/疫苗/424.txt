Our clinical program has found that a booster of our Covid vaccine increases levels of protection for those who have received our singleshot vaccine to  percent, said Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development at JJ. JJ said that when a booster was given six months after the first shot, antibody levels increased ninefold one week after the booster and continued to climb to fold higher four weeks after the booster, irrespective of age. We look forward to our discussions with the FDA and other health authorities to support their decisions regarding boosters, Mammen said. President Joe Bidens administration announced plans in August for Americans vaccinated with the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines to get third shots. Biden personally received a Covid vaccine booster shot last month and told Americans still resisting vaccination they are damaging the country. The president received a third Pfizer dose in line with recently approved health guidance, which allows boosters for those  or older. Also eligible for boosters are adults with highrisk medical conditions and those in jobs where they are frequently exposed to the virus. The FDA said Tuesday its advisory committee will meet on October  to discuss an emergency use authorization of Moderna booster shots and on October  to disuss the JJ booster. AFP
