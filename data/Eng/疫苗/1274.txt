About  preliminary reports of GuillainBarre syndrome have been detected in vaccine recipients after the administration of . million doses of the Johnson  Johnson vaccine in the United States, The Washington Post quoted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC as saying in a statement. Of these reports,  were serious and required hospitalization, and one was dead. The cases have largely been reported about two weeks after vaccination and mostly in men, many aged  and older, according to the CDC. Johnson  Johnson said Monday it has been in discussions with the FDA and other regulators about rare cases of GuillainBarre syndrome. The chance of having this occur is very low, and the rate of reported cases exceeds the background rate by a small degree, the company said in a statement.
