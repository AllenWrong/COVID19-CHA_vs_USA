SHI YUCHINA DAILY    Chinas governing system, if compared to its counterparts in the West that have historically focused on shortterm goals due to the lack of visibility beyond the next election, has always been widely admired for its longterm views and for the ability to develop wellcrafted plans that rely on clear milestones and on a constant monitoring of the direction the nation is taking. The annual Central Economic Work Conference, recently concluded in Beijing and traditionally held during the second or third week of December, represents one of the major gatherings in the countrys governance since Chinese leaders convene to discuss key macroeconomic, financial and banking topics and prepare plans for the development of the national economy in the coming year. This years Central Economic Work Conference is of particular importance because it marks the end of the th FiveYear Plan , a period of time that has registered important achievements in terms of economic and social development, while it unveils the key priorities that the country in going to face during the th FiveYear Plan  as well as the longrange objectives through the year . In , China, taking into account the emergency provoked by the unfortunate outbreak of the COVID pandemic that has forced the country to quickly adjust its agenda in order to achieve goals previously set, has been able to overcome the difficulties caused by an unpredictable event and to accomplish goals announced in the th FiveYear Plan, while in some cases going beyond expectations. The most significant examples of how China has been able to win key battles in its path to become a moderately prosperous society include the impressive achievements in the field of science and technology that have placed China and its national champions at the forefront of global innovation, overcoming Silicon Valley tech giants the rollout of unprecedented reforms for the openingup of the financial sector to foreign investors and capital with positive outcomes for domestic bond market and internationalization of the yuan and the improvement of peoples livelihoods in winning the battle against poverty in rural areas. The unquestionable success in containing the pandemic through a welldefined set of topdown rules, the full cooperation of the entire population and by leveraging the widespread presence of topnotch technologies, has allowed China to emerge as the only country to register positive growth this year and to be considered as a reference point providing valuable lessons to the rest of the world. In this sense, it is interesting to notice that the Centre for Economics and Business Research CEBR, a UKbased consultancy group, has recently predicted that the Chinese economy as a result of its fast recovery from the pandemic is now set to become the worlds largest, overtaking the United States by , half a decade sooner than previously forecast. In  China is expected to gain momentum through a fast growth trajectory that is going to offset the lost first half of  and, once the distribution of vaccine will be completed, to pave the way for a more sustainable and healthy growth through adhoc policies that serve to tackle some major difficulties that constrain the national development. In this regard, the Chinese leadership is expected to build the foundation of a new development paradigm based on the dual circulation model in which domestic and foreign markets support and reinforce each other and where the domestic market is set to become a more and more central component of the countrys economic policy. The trade war with the United States and the outbreak of COVID have enlightened the fragmentation of global markets and the necessity for China to rethink and readjust its supply chain and logistics in order to become more independent and less vulnerable to the possibility of unilateral retaliations as well as to be better prepared for future pandemics. An entirely controlled supply chain empowered by homegrown innovation would allow China to be almost selfreliant, to be protected from increasing external risks, to increase the internal demand and to strengthen its overall economic power as well as its positioning on the global political chess board. The rapid growth of major Chinese cities has created major issues in terms of affordable housing for students and lowincome citizens due to the high level of speculation in cities like Shenzhen where the cost of an apartment is equal to . times a residents average annual salary, leading the Peoples Bank of China to vow to carry out consistent financial policies to curb these practices and to declare that houses are for living in, not speculation. Attempts made by online platforms such as Danke Apartment to offer budgetfriendly housing to fresh graduates by dividing flats normally designed for families with several bedrooms into small units for cohousing have turned out to be unsuccessful and potentially a systemic risk and the government is now determined to intervene with valid solutions. Technology plays a vital role in Chinas future development due to the concrete advantages that the implementation of innovation bring to the entire society in terms of higher level of efficiency, security and safety, and the government has underlined the necessity to give priority in the next fiveyear plan to technologies that are considered strategic for the nations success such as semiconductors, AI and G. With the fast development of innovation, although important, tech giant should strengthen risk management and control, maintain business continuity and normal business operations, and ensure quality financial services for the public. Chinas financial regulators have identified major problems in some of the tech giants and have urged the relevant company to make plans and set a timetable as soon as possible to fix the problems in accordance with supervision requirements. The promotion of reform and openingup is going to elevate even further Chinas status on the global stage as a result of a more integration of its domestic market with global markets through financial liberalization and deregulation as well as a higher participation in multilateral agreements that promote economic cooperation and connectivity. The recent formation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership RCEP has marked a major diplomatic and economic achievement for China paving the way to favorably consider the possibility that the country join in the near future the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for TransPacific Partnership CPTPP as President Xi Jinping affirmed in an APEC summit in late November. The outbreak of the COVID pandemic has globally posed questions on the negative effects that the economic activity has on the environment and it is thus important that China has promptly demonstrated a sense of responsibility and purpose trying to proactively solve problems that affect the whole planet. The recent announcement to target a steeper cut in rates of carbon dioxide emissions by  is thus welcome by the entire global community and represents a further commitment through a boost in the installation of wind and solar power and an increase of the share of nonfossil fuels in order to achieve carbon neutrality by . The strength of China over the last four decades of unstoppable growth and prosperity has to be reconducted to a type of governance that guarantees stability and responsiveness to changes in the external environment, giving the country the opportunity to navigate successfully even through the harshest storms. At a time when Western economies are still suffering the consequences of the pandemic and are in desperate need of true leadership, China, through the Central Economic Work Conference, shows the whole world that good planning will get you halfway to success.
