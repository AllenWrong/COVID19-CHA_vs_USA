Renewable energy, biosafety, food security, life sciences and medicine, aerospace and advanced manufacturing, are among the key fields the UAE is looking forward to cooperating with China on, Dhaheri said in an interview with China Daily on Wednesday.  China is becoming a leader in the science and technology fields. It has strong manufacturing strength and abundant innovation resources, as well as a huge domestic market for technology commercialization, Dhaheri said.  Chinas success in responding to the COVID outbreak and the speed of its vaccine research and development also played an instructive role for other countries.

He also said that the rapid development of technology in China has produced tangible outcomes, and China is one of the global leaders in areas including infrastructure, agricultural technology, supercomputers, fintech and ecommerce. These technologies have enabled China to become a global leader in innovation, he said.  Dhaheri said he is fascinated by Chinas artificial intelligence technology, especially selfdriving vehicles, robotics and AI vision and speech technologies. He noted that Tsinghua University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences are among the worlds top institutions when it comes to AI research and achievements.  The UAE is also committed to developing AI technology and has made substantial efforts to do so. We released the worlds first national strategy on AI in , and we built the worlds first university dedicated to teaching AI, at the Mohammed Bin Zayed University for AI, said Dhaheri, adding that the institute has hired many Chinese AI scholars as teachers and in key management positions.  Since the two countries established diplomatic relations in , they have cooperated in various fields with science and technology focuses.  The Chinese tech giant Huawei has been involved in building a communications system for the UAEs railways since .  Two years ago, the UAE and Huawei signed a cooperation agreement on construction of a G network in the UAE, and a memorandum of understanding to expand and deepen cooperation on the project was signed by both sides in May.  On fintech, Dhaheri said the Dubai International Financial Center is the regional headquarters of Chinas four major banks. The center has signed a memorandum of cooperation with a number of Chinese fintech companies to promote the development of digital finance, crossborder payment and other services, according to Dhaheri.  In the healthcare sector, Chinas Sinopharm Group and the UAEs G Group cooperated on clinical trials of Chinesedeveloped COVID vaccines last year.  Were able to produce the Chinese vaccines in the UAE and the production will reach up to  million doses a year. This is not only for the UAE or China. Instead, this will be an effort to support many parts of the world to fight the COVID pandemic, the ambassador said.
