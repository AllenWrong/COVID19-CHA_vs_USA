PhotoChina Daily    The Biden administrations strategy to tackle the stillprevalent COVID pandemic sounded promising  the president vowed to reopen the majority of schools, mandate maskwearing in federal buildings and have  million Americans vaccinated in  days. These measures definitely encouraged me. A lawabiding citizen, I have been observing the stayinplace SIP practice since last March and have entered the stage of direly craving normalcy and social intimacy. California this week joined several other states, including Michigan, Arizona, Arkansas etc, to loosen coronavirus bans and restrictions on restaurants, gatherings and other businesses because of improved infection and hospitalization rates. For tens of million families nationwide that have to homeschool their children, a silver lining of hope also appears as the Centers for Disease Control CDC recently reiterated that inperson learning can be safe with physical distancing and masks. According to CDC researchers, children are not as likely to either contract or spread the coronavirus as are adults in crowded indoor facilities. Even though inschool transmission has occurred, there is little evidence that it would cause a sharp increase in community cases. If mitigation measures are properly adopted and administered on campus, as the CDC indicated, children can return to school safely. California Governor Gavin Newsom even proposed in a bill to provide financial incentives, a total of  billion, for districts to reopen classrooms in February and March. Statically, it translates to either  per student if applying by Feb , or  per student by March . Does it all look optimistic? A reality check  vaccine pileup across the nation, school readiness and community immunity rate  suggests otherwise. How much coronavirus vaccine the nation has remains a question mark. During a recent interview with Fox News, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky was caught on camera telling the nation, I cant tell you how much vaccine we have, and if I cant tell it to you, then I cant tell it to the governors, and I cant tell it to the state health officials.

They cant figure out how many sites to roll out, they cant figure out how many vaccinators that they need, and they cant figure out how many appointments to make for the public, she continued. Even when the number of vaccine doses is crisp and clear, in Californias case, the authority fouls up the rollout. Over a month, the state administered . million doses, or about only  percent of the total it has received, Newsom said at a Jan  briefing. As California emerged as a coronavirus center with more than . million accumulated cases and deaths approaching ,, Newsom is facing fierce public condemnation for his very confusing, inefficient and chaotic handling of the vaccine distribution. California state epidemiologist Dr Erica Pan said it may take four to five months to vaccinate all residents  years of age and older  the most vulnerable group. Ive made multiple calls to make appointments for my parents, said Cynthia Wang, who lives in Brentwood, a suburban town in Northern California. All told me that the earliest slot I can expect would be around April or May. Very disappointing. On reopening schools, it doesnt appear that the agenda will be resolved any time soon. In California, teachers and administrators from schools and districts voiced their concerns about safety precaution, citing the slow vaccination, still rocketing infection rate and insufficient testing capacity to push back on Newsoms call for returning to inperson learning. California previously suggested that schools could reopen if the communitys daily case rate dropped below  out of every , people. Currently, no single county has met that criteria. Government cannot mandate parents to send children back to school if its not proven safe enough, said Lilian Zhang, mom of a yearold and yearold in the San Francisco Bay Area. There is no indication that they administration have a solid plan in place for testing of, and social distancing among staff and students. Why should we rush and risk? she asked. Right. Bear in mind Rome was not built in a day, nor humanitys victory in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic.
