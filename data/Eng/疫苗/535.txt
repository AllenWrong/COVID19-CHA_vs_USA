The delivery ceremony of the donation was held virtually last Friday and those vaccines are expected to be distributed to frontline personnel and close partners through the UN system as soon as possible. The Chinese donation will be used in the African mission area on a priority basis, said Zhang Maoyu, deputy head of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, at the delivery ceremony. Chinas donation will enhance the UN capacity to respond to the epidemic and help peacekeepers better fulfill their duties and missions, according to Christian Francis Saunders, UNs Assistant SecretaryGeneral for Supply Chain Management.
