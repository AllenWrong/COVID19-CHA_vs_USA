He said that Singapore looks forward to working with the European Commission and likeminded countries, as well as the World Health Organization, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, to develop vaccines and distribute them fairly and expeditiously to people in all countries. The search for vaccines may take some time, but we will maximise our chances of tackling COVID by working together, the prime minister wrote in the post.
