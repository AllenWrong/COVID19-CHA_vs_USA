The president also provided constructive insight on the improvement in global health governance and the building of a global community of health for all, while issuing a serious warning about the rise of vaccine nationalism, he said. Contagions respect no borders. There is a tendency for shorter intervals between the breakouts of new epidemic diseases, he said. The existence of a global community of health for all is undeniable, and closer coordination among the global community would have enabled the containment of the pandemic at an earlier date, he said.

The th WHA, which will be held virtually starting on Monday, will focus on ending the pandemic and preventing the next one by building a healthier, safer and fairer world.

China has sent medical supplies to over  countries and  international organizations, providing more than  billion masks, . billion protective suits and  billion testing kits to the world. A cooperation mechanism has been established for Chinese hospitals to pair up with  African hospitals, and construction on the headquarters of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, a project assisted by China, started at the end of last year. Ivona Ladjevac, head of the Regional Center of One Belt One Road at the Institute of International Politics and Economics in Belgrade, Serbia, said Chinas contribution to the global response to the pandemic is another great sign of what a great country it is. Notwithstanding Chinese medical support and teams of experts sent worldwide, China constantly called upon every country of the world to join in this battle, which is the battle for preserving lives and humankind. This is the threat of a new kind and there is no country or man that is immune to it, she said. She noted that the vaccines provided by China to Serbia in January made it possible for a mass vaccine rollout, and secured the immunization of , people. China has provided unselfish, professional, moral and material assistance, more than envisaged by the strategic partnership agreement between our countries. Serbia will be forever grateful for that, she said. Ladjevac stressed the important role of the team of six Chinese experts who visited Serbia for two months to share Chinas experience in containing the pandemic and improving its medical system. Mqabuko Spencer Dube, the deputy head of mission at the Embassy of Zimbabwe to China, said China is not only the leading voice in calling for building a community of global health for all, it is actually walking the walk, as demonstrated by its provision of vaccine assistance to over  countries and exporting vaccines at fair and reasonable cost to more than  countries. The latest commitment made by President Xi to support the local manufacturing of vaccines is commendable, as it will improve supply and reduce costs, he said. He noted that Zimbabwe was among the first recipients of Chinese assistance after the outbreak of COVID in the form of masks, personal protective equipment and testing kits. China also sent medical teams who helped us to establish appropriate antipandemic measures and helped to refurbish our medical institutions, he said. Zimbabwe was also among the first recipients of COVID vaccines from China, with the first , doses received in February and the second shipment arriving in March. In May, the Zimbabwe Defense Forces also received , vaccines from the Peoples Liberation Army of China. China has indeed fulfilled President Xis commitment to make the vaccine a global public good, he said. Dube hailed Chinas proactive stance in relieving the debt burdens of African countries amid the fallout of the pandemic. He noted that the nation has canceled the debt of some African countries whose debts were maturing in . This act of generosity will certainly augment global efforts in combating the deadly COVID pandemic, while also strengthening the resilience of the respective countries and place their economies in a sustainable recovery mode, he said.
