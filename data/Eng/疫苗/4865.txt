Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over  of our member countries in , IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a curtainraiser speech ahead of next weeks IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings. Today, that number has been turned on its head We now project that over  countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year, she said. Amid extraordinary uncertainty about the depth and duration of the crisis, the world could anticipate the worst economic fallout since the s Great Depression, the IMF chief warned. The bleak outlook applies to advanced and developing economies alike, she said. This crisis knows no boundaries. Everybody hurts. The IMF has  trillion in lending capacity it is placing at the service of its members, Georgieva said. We are responding to an unprecedented number of calls for emergency financingfrom over  countries so far, she said. Our Executive Board has just agreed to double access to our emergency facilities, which will allow us to meet the expected demand of about  billion in financing. Even in January, when what later became a pandemic was in its early stages, leading world organizations had hoped that global growth would rise this year, however modestly. The IMF had predicted global growth to edge up from an estimated . percent in , to . percent in  and . percent for . Its sister institution, the World Bank Group, was more prudent, but envisioned a . percent growth rate this year, following a year in which weak trade and investment dragged the world economy to its feeblest performance since the  global financial crisis. But today, the world is confronted with a crisis like no other in modern times, with COVID disrupting social and economic order at an unprecedented pace. Worst of all, it has killed nearly , people while infecting more than . million as of Friday, according to the World Health Organization. All governments have sprung into action, and that is encouraging news, Georgieva said.         IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.

In addition, there have been massive monetary measures from the G and others, she said. In an open letter to governments of the Group of  nations released on Monday night, a total of  former global leaders, top executives and scientists, including Ban Kimoon, the former secretarygeneral of the United Nations, called for immediate internationally coordinated action to address the deepening global health and economic crises from COVID that require urgent specific measures that can be agreed on with speed and at scale. The letter urged G leaders to immediately agree to commit  billion to speed up research on vaccines and treatments for COVID and ways to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. A further  billion will be needed to support countries with weaker health systems and especially vulnerable populations, including the provision of vital medical supplies. It said that all health systems are buckling under the pressures of the virus. Yet if we do nothing as the disease spreads in poorer African, Asian and Latin American cities and townships and in fragile communities that have little testing equipment, ventilators or medical supplies and where social distancing and even washing hands are difficult to achieve, COVID will persist there and reemerge to hit the rest of the world with further rounds that will prolong the crisis, it warned. In terms of economic growth, the letter said the worlds aim should be to prevent a liquidity crisis turning into a solvency crisis, and a global recession becoming a global depression. To ensure this, better coordinated fiscal, monetary, central bank and antiprotectionist initiatives are needed, it said. It said that the emerging economies, in particular those of the poorest countries, need special help, not the least in ensuring that support reaches all those affected by the drastic decrease in economic activity. It also urged the international community to waive this years poorer countries debt repayments, including  billion due from Africa, and consider future debt relief to allow poor countries the fiscal space to tackle the health and economic impact of the pandemic.
