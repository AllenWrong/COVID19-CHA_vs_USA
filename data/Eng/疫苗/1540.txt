The White House on Tuesday publicly acknowledged it would miss US President Joe Bidens COVID goal of vaccinating  percent of adults with at least one dose by the July Fourth holiday weekend. The admission came as India, another country hit by hard by the coronavirus pandemic, passed the grim milestone of  million infections. In Washington, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients on Tuesday announced a revised COVID vaccination goal under which the count for the  percent threshold by that date would be applied to adults aged  and older. More than  percent of US citizens aged  or older have received at least one dose of a vaccine, Zients said. In the past week, an average of about , adults received their first vaccine each day. To reach Bidens original goal, that number will need to increase to about , adults newly vaccinated daily, an analysis by USA Today said. If the rate of adult vaccinations continues on the current sevenday average, the country will have about  percent of adults partially vaccinated by July , The New York Times forecast. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have reached the goal already, but some states are at less than  percent of all adults, Zients said at a White House briefing. The nation also needs a few extra weeks to ensure that US citizens between ages  and  are vaccinated at rates similar to older adults, Zients said at the news briefing. The age group has been shown to be least likely to get a vaccine when its available for them, a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, study released on Monday said. Young less keen on jabs The reality is, many younger Americans have felt like COVID is not something that impacts them and have been less eager to get the shot, Zients said. Adults  years with lower incomes, lower educational attainment, without health insurance, who were nonHispanic black adults who lived in suburban areas had the lowest reported vaccination coverage and intent to get vaccinated, the CDC study said. Under Bidens vaccination goals, announced on May , at least  million citizens were to be fully vaccinated by July . Zients said the US would also miss that target. Data from the CDC shows that over  percent of adults have received at least one vaccine, while nearly  percent, or approximately  million people, are fully vaccinated. As of early Wednesday, worldwide cases have reached ,,, with ,, deaths reported, the World Health Organization said. Indias COVID tally surpassed the million mark and the death toll crossed , on Wednesday, the countrys federal health ministry said. The exact tally rose to ,,, the death toll hit ,. Vaccination on a warfooting has been undertaken by the central government with effect from Monday. A record . million vaccination doses were administered free of cost to Indians aged over  on Monday, the first day of the new vaccination policy announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi a couple of weeks ago. The vaccination drive has been ramped up through availability of more vaccines, advance visibility of vaccine availability to states for enabling better planning by them, and streamlining the vaccine supply chain. The federal government conducted as many as , sessions on Monday across the length and breadth of the country in a bid to achieve the ambitious target of vaccinating over  million people aged over  years. In the words of V.K. Paul, a senior functionary of the federal government, the possible third wave could be stopped only through largescale vaccination and people strictly following health protocols.
