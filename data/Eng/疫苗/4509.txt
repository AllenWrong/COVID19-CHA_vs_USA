PhotoAgencies    SYDNEY  A simple blood samples test developed by Australias Monash University could detect positive COVID cases in about  minutes. Based on commonly used blood typing infrastructure, researchers at the Melbournebased university developed a simple agglutination assay to identify antibodies generated in response to COVID infection, according to the university. The test requires  microliters of plasma from blood samples and positive COVID cases will cause agglutination or clustering of the red blood cells, which is easily identifiable to the naked eye. Detection of antibodies in patient plasma or serum involves pipetting a mixture of reagent red blood cells and antibodycontaining serum or plasma onto a gel card containing separation media, incubating the card for  minutes, and using a centrifuge to separate agglutinated cells from free cells, Senior Lecturer in Chemical Engineering at Monash University Simon Corrie explained. While the current swab tests are used to detect active COVID infection, the antibody test can determine whether someone was infected in the past, thus helping highrisk countries with population screening, case identification, contact tracing and confirming vaccine efficacy during clinical trials. This simple assay, based on commonly used blood typing infrastructure and already manufactured at scale, can be rolled out rapidly across Australia and beyond, Corrie said. This test can be used in any lab that has blood typing infrastructure, which is extremely common across the world. The study has been published in the journal ACS Sensors. Researchers said theyre seeking commercial and government support to conduct full clinical evaluation of the test.
