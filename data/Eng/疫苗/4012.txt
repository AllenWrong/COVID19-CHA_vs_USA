A program to promote standardization of diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C kicked off in Beijing recently, to help patients suffering from the infectious disease, which may cause liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and in some cases, death.Unlike hepatitis B, awareness of hepatitis C among the public in China is low, so that a massive number of patients are not aware of their status. Their condition will deteriorate gradually and they may infect others, said Wang Guiqiang, head of the department of infectious diseases at Peking University First Hospital, at a news conference on Saturday.The number of hepatitis C patients in China is estimated to be about  million, but only about , new cases are reported every year. That is because the virus will not cause obvious symptoms in its early stages, and many patients may live with it for two or three decades, until its too late for treatment, he said.The program, initiated by the Chinese Foundation for Hepatitis Prevention and Control, plans to establish an experts guiding network and chronic hepatitis C diagnosis and treatment centers across the nation, optimize transfer treatment systems and enhance training of grassroots medical workers under a unified and scientific guideline. A total of  medical institutions   central hospitals and  countylevel hospitals  will participate in the program.Wang added the disease is mainly transmitted by blood or body fluids, and screening should be strengthened among highrisk groups, including Chinese who received blood from donators or organ transplantation before , and who had an abortion, eyebrow tattooing, ear piercing or a pedicure in unregulated institutions.He said most grassroots medical institutions became able to conduct nucleic acid testing during the fight against the COVID pandemic, which will help with the diagnosis of hepatitis C at such facilities.The World Health Organization proposed eliminating hepatitis C as a public health threat in . Although there is no vaccine for hepatitis C, the disease can be treated by antivirus drugs, experts said. Three drugs against hepatitis C have been enrolled in Chinas medical insurance list.The WHO estimates that about  million people worldwide live with hepatitis C. Three scientists who played key roles in the discovery of the hepatitis C virus were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in October.
