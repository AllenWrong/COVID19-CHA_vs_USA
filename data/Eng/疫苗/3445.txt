Poorest countries need vaccines too

In his opening remarks on Monday at the th session of the global public health watchdogs executive board, World Health Organization DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged governments to guarantee the worlds poor have equal, timely access to COVID vaccines.The efficient development and approval of multiple vaccines has offered the world a chance to contain the COVID pandemic. But the wall of inequality between the worlds haves and havenots may provide an opportunity for the novel coronavirus to advance and generate new mutants, the WHO chief warned.More than  million doses of vaccine have now been administered in at least  higherincome countries, he said. Just  doses have been given in one lowestincome country. Not  million not  thousand just .He challenged member countries to ensure that by the time World Health Day arrives on the th of April, COVID vaccines are being administered in every country.For that to happen, though, the WHO sponsored Access to COVID Tools Accelerator and its COVAX vaccine pillar must work together, so that poorer nations have equitable access to COVID tests, treatments and vaccines. Offering their support, Chinese COVID vaccine developers Sinovac, Sinopharm and Cansinobio have submitted applications to join COVAX.The traditional approach to vaccine development Chinese scientists have adopted is welltested and has proven safe and costeffective. It also means Chinese vaccines are suitable for countries that lack the cold storage facilities as required for some of the vaccines developed elsewhere.Just as the Mexican president pointed out, the Chinese vaccine his country received does not require storage at ultralow temperatures, and it is thus very friendly to those living in remote areas. No wonder Chinese vaccine developers have signed contracts with  countries and regions on the procurement of over  million doses. And that inoculation programs using Chinese vaccines have begun in a number of countries.No matter what the developed countries say about Chinese vaccines, the products are being warmly received.Beijings promises to make its vaccines a global public good and to prioritize African countries in the distribution of its vaccines are in stark contrast to the hoarding of vaccines by rich countries and their mefirst approach, which have rendered already vulnerable populations even more vulnerable.So far, it looks like China is the only supplier country now distributing its vaccines following the WHO road map. Not to mention its provision to African countries will in part be in the form of donations and free aid. Other COVID producing countries should follow Chinas example and commit to ensuring vaccines are accessible, available and affordable to developing nations. Even with the best will in the world, China cannot do it alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
