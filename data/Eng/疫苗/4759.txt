Former president Obama describes handling of outbreak by US administration as chaotic                     Since two White House staff members tested positive for the novel coronavirus last week, officials who were potentially exposed have responded in a variety of ways, raising questions about the effectiveness of the administrations handling of the outbreak.  On Saturday night, a spokeswoman for Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he would be working from home sometimes.  Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be teleworking for the next two weeks, after lowrisk exposure on Wednesday to a person at the White House who has the disease, The Washington Post reported on Saturday, citing a spokesman for Redfield.  US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn, who is , has been in selfquarantine for several weeks after coming in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID, an FDA spokesman told Reuters on Friday.  All three officials were scheduled to testify on Tuesday before a Senate committee looking at steps that states and the federal government are taking to reopen businesses and schools, which have been shut in an attempt to control the spread of the highly contagious virus.  In a separate report, Reuters said Fauci has tested negative for COVID and will continue to be tested regularly.  On Friday, CNN reported that US VicePresident Mike Pences press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for COVID, one day after a member of the US Navy who serves as one of President Donald Trumps personal valets also tested positive for the virus, raising concerns about Trumps possible exposure to the virus and the possibility of it spreading within the White House.  The United States remains the worstaffected country by the virus, with more than . million diagnosed cases and at least , deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.  Former US President Barack Obama described the US administrations handling of the pandemic as chaotic, a source said on Saturday. In his call on Friday with , members of the Obama Alumni Association, people who served in his administration, Obama said It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindsetof whats in it for me and to heck with everybody elsewhen that mindset is operationalized in our government.  But White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany dismissed Obamas criticism, saying in a statement to CNN on Saturday President Trumps coronavirus response has been unprecedented and saved American lives.  The World Health Organization said on Friday that global solidarity is crucial to fighting COVID, which is what was displayed in the global battle to eradicate smallpox  years ago.  The World Health Assembly, the WHOs decisionmaking body, officially declared on May , , that the world and all its people have won freedom from smallpox. Smallpox is the first and, to date, only human disease to be globally eradicated.  Its eradication stands as the greatest public health triumph in history, WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a virtual news conference in Geneva.  As the world confronts the COVID pandemic, humanitys victory over smallpox is a reminder of what is possible when nations come together to fight a common health threat, Tedros said.  The WHO is working with many partners to accelerate the development of a vaccine for COVID, which will be an essential tool for controlling transmission of the virus, according to the WHO.  While Tedros did not name any countries specifically, he is likely to have been referring to the lack of cooperation between China and the US. The US has decided to halt its funding for the WHO, drawing sharp criticism at home and abroad.  After the US decision last month, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that it was not the time to cut funds to the WHO, which he said is absolutely critical to the worlds efforts to win the war against COVID.  Scholars from both China and the US have recently written open letters urging the two countries to step up cooperation in fighting the global pandemic.  In an article posted on the Brookings Institution website this week, Thomas Christensen, a nonresident senior fellow at Brookings and a former US deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the two countries should seek cooperation to share best practices to develop effective vaccines, to prepare in advance for mass manufacturing and global distribution of vaccines, assist the neediest countries, to manage debt crises in the developing world and to preserve global trade.
