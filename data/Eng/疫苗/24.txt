The paper said a steep rise in COVID cases in Europe should serve as a warning to the United States because only . percent of the US population is vaccinated, lower than vaccination rates in some European nations now struggling with a spike in COVID cases, such as in Germany and France. Furthermore, it also said vaccine distribution is highly uneven across the United States, which could worsen the problem. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and codirector of the Texas Childrens hospitals center for vaccine development, predicted a pretty bad winter wave and believed it looks like its starting to happen. Theres just too many unvaccinated and too many partially vaccinated people to stop the aggressive Delta variant, the paper quoted Hotez as saying.
