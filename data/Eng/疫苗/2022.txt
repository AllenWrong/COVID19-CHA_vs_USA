Biden says economy has long way to go as critics blame COVID relief federal benefits                     The responses to the weakerthanexpected April jobs report, released on Friday, highlighted the political divide in Washington over government spending.  President Joe Biden said on Friday that the US economy has a long way to go before recovering from its pandemic slump, and he urged Washington to do more to help.  Republicans and business groups blamed generous unemployment benefits in the relief package, contending that they were discouraging lowerwage employees from going back to work. Critics have objected to the high price tag of the White Houses plans and warn the plans could trigger inflation.  US job growth also was likely restrained by shortages of workers and raw materials. Nonfarm payrolls increased by only , jobs, well below the nearly  million jobs that economists expected and in sharp contrast with steady increases from January to March.  Biden and his team have said the administrations . trillion pandemic relief package is helping to revive the economy, and they are pushing for another  trillion in new investments.  In remarks at the White House, Biden said the report just underscores in my view how vital the actions were taking are. Our efforts are starting to work. But the climb is steep, and we still have a long way to go.  US Representative Jodey Arrington, a Republican from Texas, said in a statement, It is no coincidence that this news arrives just as the Democrats biggovernment policies, like paying people more to stay home than to work, are beginning to take hold.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters, Its clear that there are people who are not ready and able to go back into the labor force, citing parents whose children are still taking classes remotely. I dont think the addition to unemployment compensation is really the factor that is making a difference.  However, the US Chamber of Commerce business lobby said the federal government should end the  weekly supplemental unemployment benefits to ease a labor shortage. The supplemental federal benefits are paid on top of what each state pays weekly in unemployment insurance. The federal payments will last until Sept .  What was intended to be a shortterm financial assistance for the vulnerable and displaced during the height of the pandemic has turned into a dangerous federal entitlement, incentivizing and paying workers to stay at home rather than encouraging them to return to the workplace, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican, said in a statement.  Paying people not to work is dampening what should be a stronger jobs market, US Chamber of Commerce Executive VicePresident and Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said in a statement. We need a comprehensive approach to dealing with our workforce issues and the very real threat unfilled positions pose to our economic recovery from the pandemic.  Some states, including Arkansas, Montana and South Carolina, have decided not to take the federal unemployment payments, in the hope the move will help businesses hire workers faster.  The majority of US states offer unemployment benefits for up to  weeks. Benefits range from  a week in Mississippi to  in Massachusetts. The payments tend to reflect a states cost of living.  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Friday that the semiconductor shortage also was a factor in lower jobs creation.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the automobile sector shed , jobs in April as automakers were forced to cancel production shifts and furlough workers amid the chips shortage.  Were working very hard to get the presidents plan passed in Congress to fund a semiconductor fund., Raimondo told MSNBC. The fact of the matter is we need to get back into the business of making more chips in America. And the supply chain issues are very real.  Jared Bernstein, a member of the presidents Council of Economic Advisers, said Bidens COVID relief and stimulus, known as the American Rescue Plan, has helped generate an average of more than half a million jobs per month, April not withstanding.  Those are big numbers, and the fingerprints of the American Rescue Plan are all over those additions, he said.  Bernstein and other officials said no course correction is required from the White House.  Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist for Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey, said Theres a mismatch in the labor market in terms of demand. We know job openings are strong. This is probably a oneoff because the labor market continues to normalize, and we should see stronger numbers as the COVID vaccination campaign continues and those who are staying home because of the unemployment benefits stipend realize it will expire by the time we get to the end of the summer.  The number of those in the US who are either working or looking for work rose last month, and the number of people who said they are not looking for jobs because of COVID fell by , in April, Bernstein said.  The April jobs report may have temporarily assuaged market concerns about inflation.  One jobs report number doesnt make a trend, but it takes some of the heat off the economy overheating and inflation moving dramatically higher, said Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James in Baltimore. Youre seeing that getting reflected in the interest rates they had the most immediate reaction.  This puts less pressure on the Fed to prematurely talk about tapering its Treasurybuying program and raising interest rates, Adam said. They wanted to be patient and hold off on it. In some ways, it might give President Biden more of a case to get through additional fiscal recovery packages.
