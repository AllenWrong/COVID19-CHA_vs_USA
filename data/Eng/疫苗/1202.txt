PhotoXinhua    ALAMEIN, Egypt  Visiting Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry on Sunday attended a ceremony marking the joint production of  million doses of COVID vaccine in Egypt. The ceremony was held during Wangs official visit to Alamein, a coastal city in northern Egypt. After China and Egypt inked a letter of intent for cooperation on COVID vaccine production in December , a Chinese company signed an agreement with an Egyptian firm and sent technical teams to Egypt to facilitate the local production of the vaccine. Only half a year after the signing of the agreement, the Chinese vaccine was officially put into production in Egypt and reached the output of  million doses in a short time. As the first batch of vaccines rolled off the production line, Egypt became the first country on the African continent to cooperate with China in the COVID vaccine production. The local production of the Chinese vaccine in Egypt, which demonstrates Chinas determination and sincerity in promoting international antipandemic cooperation, marks a concrete move to actively implement Chinese President Xi Jinpings pledge to make the vaccine a global public good. It is also an important step taken by China to promote equal distribution of the vaccines and bridge the immunity gap. This project is not only of great significance to Egypts fight against COVID pandemic, but also will greatly help Africa and the Arab region prevail over the pandemic at an early date.
