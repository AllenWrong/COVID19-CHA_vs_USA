Attacking China trumps over peoples lives

PhotoXinhua    The reaction of certain Western media outlets over the arrest of Chow Hangtung, vicehead of the socalled Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, or Hong Kong Alliance, is almost predictable. Repeating their common trick, they hyped up Chows arrest with political messages, yet anybody with the most basic knowledge about it knows how ridiculous that claim is. To safeguard local peoples health and safety, the Hong Kong police rejected HKAs application of assembly, but Chow insisted on calling people to assemble via social accounts, an act deemed illegal and which led to her arrest, as confirmed by local reports quoting the police. It seems some political forces are so eager to badmouth China that they forget everything else. For them, attacking China comes before residents lives. In order to show China in bad light they could side with the COVID virus and call for assembly that might help the latter to spread. And their ultimate purpose is clear to launch a color revolution in China and subvert the legal regime. A move that will victimize the . billion people in China, including the . million residents of Hong Kong SAR. There are still imported infection cases in Hong Kong and the local vaccination completion rate is only  percent. At a critical time to consolidate the antipandemic efforts, would some antiChina political forces please care a bit about peoples lives? Even Richard Tsoi Yiucheong, secretary of HKA, said that Chows words do not reflect those of HKA. He also said that HKA does not advocate assembly. Stay legal, stay safe from the virus. Thats what is needed in Hong Kong, not political speculation.
