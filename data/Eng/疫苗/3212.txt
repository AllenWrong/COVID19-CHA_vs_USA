The past year was hard and extraordinary. Thanks to joint efforts in the city, we have made significant strides in pandemic control as well as economic recovery, Lin said. However, considering recent outbreaks in some areas of the country, the fight against COVID is far from over. Regular pandemic prevention and control remains a crucial prerequisite for the city to achieve economic growth, Lin added.

Statistics show that . million people had received the COVID vaccine at  inoculation venues across the city by Jan .

After the vaccine gets market approval, all eligible people can be inoculated free of charge. Beijing made much headway in research and development of vaccines, diagnostic reagents and drugs related to the pandemic last year. As the mass vaccinations proceed, the local pharmaceutical industry will see rapid development in  due to the surge in vaccine production, Lin said.

The city will also step up support for micro, small and mediumsized enterprises in  to stabilize employment amid the health crisis. Micro, small and mediumsized enterprises are essential to the economic stability of the city, since they provide nearly  percent of Beijings employment, Lin said. For one thing, we will offer targeted assistance to industries hit hard by the pandemic such as accommodation, catering and tourism.

Beijing is home to a large number of tech startups, which need our help to tide over difficulties and continue to thrive, he said. Beijing is also striving to create more jobs while adhering to pandemic control measures. Local authorities plan to promote new forms of work that became popular amid the COVID outbreak such as working from home and staggering shifts, according to Lin.

We will ramp up efforts to improve the quality of service consumption such as elderly care, healthcare and housekeeping, Lin said.
