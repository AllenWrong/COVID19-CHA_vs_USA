Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said the COVID epidemic on the island continues to worsen, but the DPP authority ignored the lives, health and safety of Taiwan compatriots, deliberately inflamed crossStraits relations and created troubles. It once again exposed the DPP authority s attempts to seek independence, treating the lives of the people as nothing and blindly carrying out political operations regardless of the health and wellbeing of the people in Taiwan, he said. Ma urged the US to abide by the oneChina principle and the three ChinaUS joint communiques, properly handle Taiwanrelated affairs and cease any form of official or military interactions with the island.
