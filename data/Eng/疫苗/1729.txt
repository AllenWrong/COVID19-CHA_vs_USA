The allocation plan for the  million doses was a part of the Biden administrations overall framework to share  million doses globally by the end of June. Among the  million doses, nearly  million will be shared through COVAX, including approximately  million doses for Latin America and the Caribbean, approximately  million for South and Southeast Asia, and approximately  million for Africa, Biden said in a White House statement. The remaining over  million doses will be shared directly with countries and partners including Canada, Mexico, India, and South Korea, according to the statement. The Biden administration has been under increasing international pressure to share its massive vaccine stockpile. US media reported back in March that the United States had purchased enough vaccines to immunize every adult in the country three times over.
