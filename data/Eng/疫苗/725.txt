Mask mandates row heats up in US
2021-09-02 00:00
As schools resume inperson class for the fall semester across the United States, more faculty members from schools that refuse to issue mask or vaccination mandates are petitioning, protesting, or even resigning over a lack of safety measures at their campuses.Hundreds of colleges and universities in the US require their students to be vaccinated to return to campus and wear masks in classes or during activities, since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines for universal masking in indoor public places regardless of vaccination status.Despite the CDCs recommendations, some universities, primarily in conservative states, refuse to institute mask or vaccination mandates citing state laws that prohibit such restrictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
