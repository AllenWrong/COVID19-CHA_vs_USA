2021-07-22 00:00
The United Kingdoms prime minister was prepared to sacrifice the nations oldest residents to avoid a second novel coronavirus lockdown, according to Dominic Cummings, his former senior adviser.  Cummings, who had been a close aide and confidant of Boris Johnson and appeared to be inseparable from him, left his Downing Street job late last year, after apparent infighting among the prime ministers inner circle of nonelected officials.  He has since embarrassed the prime minister several times with claims about conduct and comments made behind closed doors.  In his latest salvo, Cummings told the BBC that Johnson did not want to reintroduce novel coronavirus restrictions in the fall because people dying from COVID at the time were essentially all over .  Cummings told the broadcaster that Johnson even began to regret ordering the first national lockdown back in March, and said he was tempted to let the virus wash through the country, rather than order a lockdown that would destroy the economy.  Cummings claimed that he, the UKs chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance and Englands chief medical officer Chris Whitty all lobbied for an immediate reintroduction of the lockdown. But he said Johnson dragged his feet and texted No, no, no, no, no, Im not doing it.  Cummings said Johnson was fearful that rightwing sections of the British media and extreme elements in his ruling Conservative Party would not accept another lockdown.  The former aide said the prime minister was essentially willing to put his own political interests ahead of peoples lives.  The oneonone BBC interview was Cummings first such interrogation since losing his job. Cummings also claimed Johnson noted that the median age of those dying from COVID was between  and  for men and  for women in September and October.  Need to recalibrate  The prime minister allegedly wrote to aides saying Hardly anyone under  goes into hospital and of those, virtually all survive. And I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff. Folks, I think we may need to recalibrate There are max  million in this country aged over .  However, after behindthescenes wrangling and following the National Health Service predicting daily deaths were set to rise to several thousand on Oct , the prime minister announced a fourweek lockdown that would start on Nov .  The Guardian said Cummings claims, alongside text and WhatsApp messages that appear to corroborate them, will cast further doubt over the actions of the prime minister in the runup to the November lockdown.  The Independent said Cummings has repeatedly accused the prime minister of acting too slowly ahead of the UKs second lockdown.  Since the start of the pandemic, the prime minister has taken the necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice, the Financial Times quoted a spokesperson for the prime minister as saying.  The spokesperson said the government had led the fastest vaccination rollout in Europe, saved millions of jobs through the furlough scheme and prevented the NHS from being overwhelmed through three national lockdowns.  Cummings has previously embarrassed Johnson and his government by claiming that former health secretary Matt Hancock was not up to the job during a sevenhour committee meeting with members of Parliament, and by saying in his blog that the prime minister had allowed party donors to pay for refurbishments to his home.  But Cummings himself is a highly controversial figure who angered many people by ignoring national lockdown rules last year and driving hundreds of kilometers to visit family in northern England.  earlemail.chinadailyuk.com         Dominic Cummings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
