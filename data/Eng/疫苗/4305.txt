Chinas top diplomat to the European Union hopes that China and the EU will seize the opportunities arising from a toplevel meeting next week to expand cooperation. Zhang Ming, head of the China Mission to the EU, made the remarks on Wednesday, ahead of a video conference next Monday between President Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Germany holds the EU presidency for the second half of this year. Zhang said the two sides have so far held highlevel dialogues on issues covering trade, green policies and digital technology, as well as strategic and security matters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
