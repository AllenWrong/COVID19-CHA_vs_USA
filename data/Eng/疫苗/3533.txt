Meanwhile, Tedros urged COVID vaccine manufacturers from around the world to move swiftly to provide the necessary data which will allow the organization to consider them for emergency use listings. The team is separate from the WHO mission which will arrive in China on Thursday to conduct joint scientific research with Chinese peers on the origin of the novel coronavirus, according to the WHO chief. A number of countries, including Egypt, the UAE, Jordan and Indonesia, have authorized the COVID vaccines produced by China for emergency use. And many more countries, including Brazil, Chile, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Nigeria, have ordered Chinese vaccines or are cooperating with China in procuring or rolling out the vaccines. More than  million doses of homegrown coronavirus vaccine have been administered in China, the National Health Commission said on Saturday.
