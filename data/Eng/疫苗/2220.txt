It is the West that is increasingly uneasy about a multilateral system where China participates on equal footing, and wishes to revise it.He pointed out that Chinas economic leadership brings attention to regions that are normally in the blind spot of the United States and Europe.Some competition is good. Without Chinas vaccination efforts in Southeast Asia, or the BRI projects in Central Asia, the EU and the Quad would probably make less efforts to assist these regions, he said. The socalled Quad countries are Japan, India, the United States and Australia.Makiyama, an economist and trade lawyer, said when Xi pledges to implement the Foreign Investment Law, economists understand how China is opening up its economy because there is a demand for foreign capital, and not necessarily due to foreign pressure.He added that Europeans who believe the ChinaEU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment is a tool for political leverage against China are mostly economic illiterate.Jade Currie, regional editor for Asia at research and publishing firm Oxford Business Group, said that the resumption of the Boao Forum for Asia, after its cancellation last year due to the pandemic, is in itself a promising sign for the regions recovery.Intraregional cooperation, knowledgesharing and a comprehensive effort to welcome foreign investments will be key as Asia eyes longterm economic recovery from the challenges of , Currie said.Contact the writers at chenweihuachinadaily.com.cn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
