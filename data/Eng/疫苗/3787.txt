Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga late on Monday further restricted a travel subsidy program in a bid to contain mounting coronavirus infections, as his approval rating plummeted to about  percent from about  percent in the three months over the handling of the pandemic. The government has decided to suspend the Go To Travel from Dec  to Jan  nationwide, local media reported on Monday. Suga also announced plans to compensate bars that cooperate with earlyclosure requests and provide special allowances for medical workers. Media had widely reported earlier that the suspension would cover only the hardesthit cities and regions such as the capital, Tokyo, and Nagoya, in central Japan. Tokyo, the Japanese city hardest hit by the virus, confirmed  new infections on Sunday, official figures showed. South Korea ordered schools to close from Tuesday in Seoul and surrounding areas as it battles its worst outbreak since the pandemic began, surpassing the previous peak in February. Schools in the capital region would move classes online until the end of the month, in the latest ratcheting up of social distancing measures which so far have failed to reverse the spike in infections. The school closures mark a step toward the imposition of Phase  social distancing rules, a move that would essentially lock down Asias fourthlargest economy. Prime Minister Chung Syekyun said such a step required careful review, as the government comes under mounting pressure to do more to stem the rise in infections. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on Monday reported  new cases, down from the record daily increase from a day earlier.
