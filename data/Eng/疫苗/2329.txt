It divided the countries into two types those with COVID vaccines and those who have to wait, with the former ones most likely to quickly place vaccine orders, secure stocks and administer shots. Countries can debate this as much as they want but we are seeing vaccine nationalism, explicitly and implicitly, said Gita Gopinath, the IMFs chief economist. She said that wealthier countries should share their shots with poorer nations as the latter have been struggling both to secure vaccine supplies and borrowing money to support their economies. The rollout of the vaccine programs in the UK and the US have been successful  almost half . percent of the UK population and onethird . percent of the US population has received at least one dose. By contrast, programs have barely got going in developing countries like Mali  percent of the population vaccinated, Pakistan . percent, Vietnam . percent, Trinidad and Tobago . percent and Namibia . percent. The UK has ordered more than  million vaccine doses, more than three times the numbers required. Gopinath said  million people have entered the ranks of the extreme poor in the last  months  the majority in India and SubSaharan African. She wants the vaccines to be obtained in a fairer way as soon as possible, and argues that wealthier countries can benefit from sharing them while respecting economic interests.
