WASHINGTON  White House Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci has recently said that he believes the natural origins theory of the novel coronavirus is still the most likely.The most likely explanation is a natural evolution from an animal reservoir to a human, Fauci, also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, told CNN during an interview on Saturday.Paul Offit, a member of the US Food and Drug Administrations vaccine advisory committee, echoed Faucis remarks.I think the chance that this was created by laboratory workers  that it was engineered  is zero, Offit told CNN in a separate interview.Matthew Kavanagh, director of the Global Health Policy  Politics Initiative at Georgetown University told Rolling Stone, a US magazine, earlier this month that US President Joe Bidens use of the intelligence community and not health officials to conduct a review into the origins of the coronavirus may have already politicized the matter.This tells us that this is a political and an intelligence story not a story mostly about science, Kavanagh said. And so we should understand the picture in that sense, and not be naive about it. Were in a place where politics is driving peoples scientific understanding in a dangerous way.Kavanagh added that if the aim of Bidens report was to find a scientific explanation for the origins of COVID, he would have tasked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the National Institutes of Health with it, instead of US intelligence agencies.
