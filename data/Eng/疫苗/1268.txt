Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed on Monday that the last part of lifting lockdown restrictions in England would go ahead as planned on July , which means an end to social distancing and the compulsory wearing of masks. However, despite the end of the legal requirement to wear masks, government guidance remains that people should still wear them. When asked by a BBC reporter if he would wear one himself, Johnson replied that it will depend on the circumstances. In an interview with Sky News, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said people would still be expected to wear masks indoors and in enclosed places after the legal requirement to do so ends. Before the official announcement, Johnson said the country was tantalizingly close to the final milestone in our road map out of lockdown, but the plan to restore our freedoms must come with a warning. He acknowledged that COVID cases would increase as the lifting of restrictions happen, with caution being absolutely vital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
