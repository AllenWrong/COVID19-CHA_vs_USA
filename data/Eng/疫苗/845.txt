Faced with research showing the waning strength of COVID vaccines as the Delta variant spreads across the US, the administration of President Joe Biden reportedly will recommend that people get a booster shot eight months after their second dose.Booster shots will begin as early as midtolate September after an application from Pfizer and BioNTech for the additional shot of their vaccine is cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, according to The New York Times. Officials envision giving people the same vaccine they originally received.Global access to vaccines is also important to stem the pandemic and prevent the emergence of new variants. Booster shots could crimp already tight global vaccine supplies. Last week, US health officials recommended boosters for some people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
