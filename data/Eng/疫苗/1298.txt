Taiwan reported  new novel coronavirus infections on Saturday and six deaths due to COVID, of which  were domestic infections and two of the people who died were in their s, the youngest deaths on the island due to the disease.  In its most recent wave of the novel coronavirus to hit Taiwan, the total number of domestic infections has reached ,, and there have been  deaths. That means the COVID death rate on the island exceeds  percent, almost twice the worlds average.  On Monday, two full months will have passed since the islands health authorities adopted a thirdlevel alert on May  because of a new wave of infections. During the two months, the pandemic on the island has not been eased a bit, and the alert has been extended for two more weeks, without anyone knowing whether it will continue.  This harmful situation could have been prevented had the islands leader Tsai Ingwen and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party not put their selfish political interests above the lives and health of people on the island.  On the very day of the new outbreak in Taiwan, the Chinese mainland publicly expressed its willingness to help, but this assistance was rejected by the Tsai administration. In fact, the mainland has more than once expressed its willingness to offer domestic vaccines that are approved by the World Health Organization, as well as support the offer of vaccines by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group and its German partner BioNTech. The Tsai administration has even rejected applications from local businesses to buy them.  Yet the Tsai administration has shown a different face to the United States and Japan, expressing its gratitude for the . million doses the island is receiving from the US and the AstraZeneca vaccines it is getting from Japan.  As a result of the vicious political games the Tsai administration is playing, the islands vaccination rate is still around  percent..  It is Tsai and the DPP that have caused such a miserable situation. The public health crisis has made it clear that the DPP is a party that cares only about its own political interests.  For whatever reason, the Tsai administration has no reason to turn down the help from the mainland as there are obviously not enough vaccines to meet the need of residents on the island. If Taiwan authorities really put the interests of people before everything, they should know how absurd they are to reject help from the mainland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
