COVID leaving a legacy of orphans

She became an orphan once she was born.  As doctors helped Davy Macias, , to deliver her baby prematurely by cesarean section, the mother died of complications from COVID while she was intubated. She would never see her daughter.  Her husband, Daniel Macias, , would get only a brief glimpse of the baby girl because he also was being treated in the same hospital after contracting the virus. Less than two weeks later, he also died from complications from the virus, leaving the child without parents or a name.  The California couple left behind five children, ages , , , , and now  weeks.  The children are being cared for by their grandparents.  Terry Macias, Daniels mother, told CNN that she isnt sure if the children understand that their parents are not coming home.  Terry Macias also told The Washington Post that the children spend a lot of time at night looking for Mom and Dad.  The two are among more than , people in the US who have died due to the coronavirus. Davy Macias was unvaccinated because she was pregnant. Her husband also was not vaccinated, according to USA Today.  Their deaths echo the story of Lydia and Lawrence Rodriguez, a Texas couple who last month died weeks apart, leaving behind four children, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Nearly , children have lost their parents, grandparents or caregivers to COVID in the US, according to a paper published in The Lancet in July. The US ranks fourth with the most children orphaned by COVID deaths, behind Mexico, Brazil and India.  Our study establishes minimum estimateslower boundsfor the numbers of children who lost parents andor grandparents, Juliette Unwin, the studys colead author, said in a statement. Many demographic, epidemiological, and healthcare factors suggest that the true numbers affected could be orders of magnitude larger.  Low vaccination rates, she said, will result in millions of more children experiencing orphanhood.  That toll is expected to worsen as the pandemic, now driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, increasingly infects unvaccinated people under age  who are most likely to have dependent children.  Out of control COVID epidemics abruptly and permanently alter the lives of the children who are left behind, Seth Flaxman, one of The Lancet studys authors, said in a statement. These children, he said, will grow up profoundly damaged by the experience.  There are also racial disparities involved. In April, researchers reported in JAMA Pediatrics that while black children constitute about  percent of this nations population under , they make up  percent of all children whove lost a parent to COVID.  Children losing primary caregivers have higher risks of experiencing mental health problems physical, emotional, and sexual violence and family poverty, said the research team at The Lancet.  These adverse experiences raise risks of suicide, adolescent pregnancy, infectious diseases including HIVAIDS, and chronic diseases.  There is an urgent need to prioritize these children and support them for many years into the future, said Susan Hillis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who led the study.  Support for a grieving child can take several forms, including individual counseling and camps or group programs. The National Alliance for Grieving Children provides resources and a regional directory for helping children deal with loss.  Public health responses to the pandemic, such as stayathome orders and the constraints of conducting child protection evaluations remotely, have severely reduced the capacity of established child protection systems and services to provide much needed child safety interventions and support, the study said.  The timing of providing the aid is crucial, according to psychologist Kathryn Cullen, who wrote in a  editorial in The American Journal of Psychiatry that the first two years after losing a parent is a period of critical risk for developing depression, according to Forbes.  The CDC urged all pregnant women to get the COVID vaccine in early August, as hospitals in US hot spots saw a rise in the number of unvaccinated motherstobe seriously ill with the virus.  Studies have found that the coronavirus vaccine does not heighten the risk of miscarriages, according to the Journal. Research shows that those who are pregnant face a higher risk of severe COVID symptoms, premature births and other adverse pregnancy outcomes if they contract the virus, the CDC said.  minluzhangchinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
