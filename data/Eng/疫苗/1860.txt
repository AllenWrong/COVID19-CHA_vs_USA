More than  countries have expressed their endorsement of the decision to deny Taiwan access to the WHA, according to Zhao Lijian, Chinas foreign ministry spokesman. Nearly  of them wrote to the World Health Organization, or WHO, to voice support to China, he said on Twitter. The US attempt to squeeze Taiwan into WHA has no chance of success. Chen Xu, Chinas permanent representative to the UN Office at Geneva and other international organizations in Switzerland, said that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and the Taiwanrelated proposal is in violation of the purposes and principles of the UN charter, runs against the WHOs constitution and the WHAs rules of procedure, and is illegal and invalid.

At Mondays meeting, WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the COVID vaccine crisis was scandalous and warned that the world remains in a dangerous situation. In his opening remarks to the th World Health Assembly on Monday, he said that more cases have been reported so far this year than in the whole of , and that if the trend continues, the number of deaths from COVID will overtake last years total within the next three weeks. No country should assume it is out of the woods, no matter its vaccination rate, he said. He said that no variants have so far emerged that significantly undermine the efficacy of vaccines, diagnostics or therapeutics. But there is no guarantee that will remain the case, he added. Tedros lashed out at global vaccine inequality, saying the ongoing vaccine crisis is a scandalous inequity that is perpetuating the pandemic. According to the WHO, more than  percent of all vaccines have been administered in just  countries. There is no diplomatic way to say it a small group of countries that make and buy the majority of the worlds vaccines control the fate of the rest of the world, he said. He said that the number of doses administered globally so far would have been enough to cover all health workers and older people if they had been distributed equitably. We could have been in a much better situation, he said. The WHO chief said that countries that vaccinate children and other lowrisk groups now do so at the expense of health workers and highrisk groups in other countries. He also pointed out that the number of doses available for COVAX, the global initiative for equitable distribution, remains vastly inadequate. Tedros called on member states to support a massive push to vaccinate at least  percent of the population of every country by September, and to achieve another goal of vaccinating at least  percent by the end of the year. This is crucial to stop severe disease and death, keep our health workers safe and reopen our societies and economies, he said. At the G Global Health Summit on Friday, Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, proposed to vaccinate  percent of the worlds population by the end of this year, and  percent by mid. Tedros said that the WHO is talking with the IMF, member states and partners, about how to achieve the ambitious targets. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has also warned of the dangers of a twospeed global response. Sadly, unless we act now, we face a situation in which rich countries vaccinate the majority of their people and open their economies, while the virus continues to cause deep suffering by circling and mutating in the poorest countries, he said. We are at war with virus. We need the logic and urgency of a war economy, to boost the capacity of our weapons, Guterres said. He called for at least a doubling of manufacturing capacity by exploring all options, from voluntary licenses and technology transfers, to patent pooling and flexibility on intellectual property rights. I am ready to mobilize the entire United Nations system to support this effort, he said. South Africas President Cyril Ramaphosa also called for the huge divide in vaccination to be corrected. This is not only a moral imperative. Effective and comprehensive global vaccination is vital to ending the pandemic, he said. Germanys Chancellor Angela Merkel noted that the pandemic reminds the world how important international cooperation is. She raised the idea of a global health threat council to improve prevention and responses to future pandemics. We have to have institutions that are up to the task, that meet our ambitions, added Frances President Emmanuel Macron.
