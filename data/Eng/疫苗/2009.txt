The worsening pandemic situation in Indiawith its daily COVID infections around , over the past weekas well as in some of its neighboring countries such as Nepal which also saw a fast increase in cases, has raised the alarm for China to exercise the utmost vigilance against possible imported cases. Making the task especially challenging is the fact that the variant blamed for the massive resurgence of the novel coronavirus in India is highly transmissible. Any letup in vigilance against this invisible enemy of humanity may have devastating consequences. This is a bitter lesson many countries have already learned since the virus first struck. China has so far done an excellent job in its prevention and control work, with zero local infections reported for more than a month. The past May Day holiday, which saw around  million trips recorded nationwide, has further proved that efforts to keep COVID at bayincluding the wearing of face masks, social distancing and capacity controls at tourist or cultural siteshave been effective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
