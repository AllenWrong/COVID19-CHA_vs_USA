The first batch of vaccines left Luxembourg on Wednesday afternoon and is expected to arrive in Taipei on Thursday morning, according to the company.

Fosun signed a contract with German company BioNTech in March last year to participate in the research and development of vaccines, and it owns exclusive rights to distribute them on the Chinese mainland, the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and Taiwan.
