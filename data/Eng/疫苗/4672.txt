Washington focuses on competition with Beijing at cooperations expense
2020-05-27 00:00
The latest major US document on its China policy highlights a great power competition but does not mention the devastating COVID public health crisis, which experts believe has been exacerbated by strategic competition and can be resolved only by defusing such a rivalry.  The United States Strategic Approach to The Peoples Republic of China, sent to Congress on Wednesday, lays out the US administrations wholeofgovernment approach to China, grounded in allout strategic competition.  Guided by a return to principled realism, the document says competition necessarily includes engagement with China, but those engagements should be selective and resultsoriented to advance US interests. The strategy also calls for increasing public pressure on Beijing and leveraging proportional costs when necessary.  The page document makes no mention of the COVID pandemic.  A Washington Post column on the US policy document on Thursday ran under the headline COVID has brought Trumps warring China factions together.  As of Tuesday, the disease had infected at least . million people worldwide and claimed more than , lives, including those of nearly , Americans, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.  The destructive path of COVID has been enabled by this unnecessary strategic competition. End it now and the peoples of America andChina will benefit, the National Committee on USChina Relations said on its Twitter account on Thursday, a day after the release of the US policy paper on China.  The post promoted an article by Stephen Orlins, the New Yorkbased committees president, in which he said the US should recognize that its designation of China as a strategic competitor creates a selffulfilling prophecy, and that USChina strategic competition has worsened the impact of the coronavirus, potentially costing thousands of lives in both countries.  In an opinion article in the South China Morning Post, Orlins said the Trump administration cut staff by more than twothirds at a key US public health agency operating inside China before the coronavirus outbreak.  Staff losses since early  included epidemiologists and the position of an American trainer of Chinese epidemiologists, and in the same period, the US Agency for International Development and National Science Foundation, both of which have roles in monitoring disease, closed their Beijing offices, according to Orlins.  He also discussed the participation of US experts in the World Health Organizations joint mission in China in early February, calling it too little, too late.  Since the onset of the coronavirus outbreak, many US researchers and scientists have called for ramping up the sharing of best practices and pandemic information between the two countries.  Deborah Seligsohn, an environmental, science, technology and health counselor at the US embassy in Beijing from  to , and now a political scientist at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, told China Daily We need to increase our research cooperation on diagnostics, treatment, vaccinesthe full range of tools to address this pandemic. We need to be working together.  Orlins also wrote The crisis perfectly illustrates why the United States and China must cooperate. While the two countries will compete economically and diplomatically, strategic competitionwith the accompanying suspicion, restrictions on economic activity and increased defense spendingonly harms the American and Chinese peoples.  But if strategic competition were put aside, a number of reciprocal steps could be taken, including establishing a careful definition of national security accepted by both countries, so that jobcreating investments and exports can continue to flow, while narrowly limiting visa denials and assuring the Chinese do the same, according to Orlins.  He was not alone in criticizing what he called unnecessary strategic competition between Washington and Beijing amid the pandemic crisis.  Instead of greatpower competition, Frank L. Smith III, director of the Cyber  Innovation Policy Institute at the US Naval War College, said success in combating the global threat of the novel coronavirus depends on a greatpower concert.  He said that although concerted action is difficult, given longstanding tensions between these great powers, particularly during US presidential campaigns, such an effort serves the national interests of both China and the United States.  Its also one of the only ways to marshal a global response to this pandemic, he said in a recent commentary.  Chinas Foreign Ministry, in commenting on the newly unveiled US strategic approach to China on Friday, said ChinaUS relations are now at a crucial juncture. It urged the US to abandon its Cold War mentality and ideological bias and view China and ChinaUS relations in an objective and rational way.  Days before the release of the US policy report, Robert B. Zoellick, former US trade representative and deputy secretary of state, said proponents of heightening the conflict with China understate the diplomatic successes of recent years.  In an opinion article published in The Wall Street Journal on May , Zoellick said the New Cold Warriors cant contain China, given its ties throughout the world. The US can impose costs on China, but to what end, and at what price to Americans? he wrote.  Zoellick, also a former World Bank president, said it is flat wrong to suggest that working with China has not served US interests, adding that selfdeception will lead to dangerous diplomacy.  The new US document concludes that the United States recognizes the longterm strategic competition between our two systems but meanwhile remains open to constructive, resultsoriented engagement and cooperation from China where out interests align.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said The US also said in the report that it does not seek to contain Chinas development. We urge the US to match its words with deeds and earnestly respect Chinas core interests and major concerns instead of saying one thing and doing another.  huanxinzhaochinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
