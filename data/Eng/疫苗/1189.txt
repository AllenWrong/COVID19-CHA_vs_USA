JIN DINGCHINA DAILY    Xi stresses solidarity, cooperation while striving for brighter future for humanity President Xi Jinping has helped dismiss lingering allegations hyping the China threat and offered a Chinese solution to boost global growth amid the COVID pandemic, as he stressed in recent speeches that China never seeks hegemony and is always dedicated to cooperation, analysts said. Leaders, officials and experts worldwide also expressed their confidence in Chinas role as a champion of peace, underlining the need for countries to further team up with China in various fields for their prosperity and everincreasing mutual benefit. Posing systemic challenges and expanding military presence are among the allegations made by some foreign politicians or media in recent months against China or the Communist Party of China as part of their evolving China threat narratives. At a ceremony marking the centenary of the foundation of the CPC on July , Xi, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, said, The Chinese nation does not carry aggressive or hegemonic traits in its genes. The nation will remain committed to promoting peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit, he said. We will continue to champion cooperation over confrontation, to open up rather than close our doors, and to focus on mutual benefits instead of zerosum games, Xi said.
