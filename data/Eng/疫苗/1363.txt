Eyes on Thailand as quarantine set aside, but key Chinese market on hold                    Thailands move to welcome vaccinated international tourists for quarantinefree stays may set a model for other countries in the region, but the return of Chinese visitorsthe kingdoms biggest source of foreign guestscould take some time, experts said. The reopening of the tourismdependent country will be a proof of concept as it may show how this will work in Asia, said Bill Barnett, managing director of hospitality consultancy C Hotelworks in Thailand. Under a program called Phuket Sandbox, the southern resort island started to allow fully vaccinated foreign tourists quarantinefree travel from Thursday. A further three popular Thai destinationsKoh Samui, Koh Phangan, and Koh Taowill join a similar program from July , followed gradually by other locations later in the year. Almost , foreign tourists have applied for an entry certificate through Thai embassies and consulates around the world since Thursday, the Bangkok Post reported on Monday. The Tourism Authority of Thailand expects the pilot plan to help bring in about , foreign tourists and , Thai travelers to Phuket by September, generating a cash flow of about  billion baht  million. Though China has been Thailands biggest source of foreign tourists in recent years, Barnett said he thinks that Chinese visitor numbers are unlikely to be high in the short term given Chinas stringent quarantine requirements for returning travelers. Its a twoway issue, he said. We dont expect any Chinese tourists to visit Thailand until the outbound China travel is kind of reset. Jesper Palmqvist, area director for Asia Pacific at hospitality consultancy STR, said another reason that international tourism destinations like Thailand will need to wait longer for Chinese tourists is the rapid development of Chinas domestic tourism market, which had been growing fast even before the COVID pandemic. The faster source markets will most likely be Eastern Europe, Russia, and parts of ASEAN, said Palmqvist referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He said travelers, mostly from Europe, are already booking well in advance to spend their holidays in Thailand, especially for stays during the fourth quarter of this year. Thailand has set a target to fully reopen to foreign visitors in midOctober, as Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chanocha had said on June  that the country aimed to reopen within  days. Prayut, after coming into contact with a businessperson who later tested positive for COVID, has been placed in quarantine, Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday. The encounter came during events for the Phuket Sandbox on Thursday. The Bangkok Post reported the prerequisite is that only provinces that have vaccinated  percent of their populations will be allowed to open completely, citing Thailands Center for COVID Situation Administration. The Thai authorities have kept a safetyfirst approach for the last  months. If it reaches  percent of the vaccination rate  I think there is a great opportunity to open up and start recovery, said Palmqvist. High hopes He said countries will have to reopen due to economic reasons. Thailand lost about  billion in tourism revenue last year when foreign arrivals plunged  percent to . million, from a record . million in , Reuters said in a report in early June. By Monday, Thailand had reported nearly , coronavirus infections with , deaths, according to Thai health authorities. For a full reopening, Thailand has set a goal to vaccinate  million people by early October. If the vaccination rate progresses as the government anticipates, and travelers are fully immunized prior to arrival and tested for COVID upon arrival, Thailand can safely reopen, said Sompong Vongpunsawad, a virologist with the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. About  percent of Phuket residents had received a first dose of a COVID vaccine by Thursday. Across Thailand as of Monday, . million doses had been administered since the country launched a national inoculation program in February, according to official data. Sompong, conceding that it might be impossible to prevent imported infections or community spread of the coronavirus, said Thailand is aiming to do what is feasible. kellychinadailyapac.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
