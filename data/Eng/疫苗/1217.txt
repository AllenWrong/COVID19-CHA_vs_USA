I personally dont trust mRNA results, compared with something that is traditional, which has been used for over  years, said Tan Bin Seng, a retired Singaporean doctor, referring to inactivatedvirus vaccines. Some see no downside to taking the Chinamade vaccine, which is based on more established technology, as cases in Singapore are few.

Safety concerns have been amplified on social media, where locals share posts and experiences about the side effects of the mRNA vaccines. Europes drug regulator last week said it had found a possible link between very rare heart inflammation and mRNA COVID vaccines from PfizerBioNTech and Moderna, in line with US findings last month, though both said benefits of the shots far outweigh the risks. Allergic reactions have been also reported after mRNA shots. Private clinics in Singapore had given more than , doses of CoronaVac as of early July, the report said.
