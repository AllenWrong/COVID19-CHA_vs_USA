PhotoXinhua    LONDON  Phase  clinical trial of the CoronaVac COVID vaccine in over  children and adolescents suggests two doses of the vaccine are safe and generate a strong antibody response, according to a study published Monday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal. Chinese researchers conducted a randomized, doubleblind, controlled phase  clinical trial of the CoronaVac COVID vaccine, developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, in more than  healthy children and adolescents aged three to  years in China. The results showed that more than  percent of children and adolescents who received two doses of the vaccine in the trial developed antibodies against the novel coronavirus SARSCoV, the study said. Most adverse reactions were mild or moderate, with pain at the injection site, the most commonly reported symptom, according to the study. But the researchers also said that, owing to the small number of participants in the study, the results should be interpreted with caution as it was not possible to draw strong statistical conclusions.
