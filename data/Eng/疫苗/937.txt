Progress in COVID response should not be politicized

Swift and decisive actions in implementing strategic and evidencebased public health and social measures, including application of test, trace and treat strategies, with robust political governance proved valuable in initially limiting the transmission of COVID and mitigating its impacts in global and regional communities. Still, the virus, instead of being laid to rest, has adapted to become even strongeras if having a resolve of its own to counter the progress against its spread by constant mutation. This has caused the rapid emergence of variants, which are more transmissible, more resistant to treatments or vaccines, and may be more severe clinically. With all the progressive and positive multisectoral and multistakeholder cooperation and developments against this pandemic amid the omnipresence of challenges and threats, the entire discourse on the situation is far from health or social issues and interventions. At all levels of social strata and sociodemographic dimensions in every region, country, and community, the whole pandemic threat and interventions against it have sadly been politicized or stigmatized. Public and social measures, including lockdown and vaccine rollouts, have been perceived to be politically motivated and to be offensive to the persons rights to selfpreservation and freedom of choice, intermixed with a lot of conspiracy theories. These latter have not waned in spite of the evidencebased and sciencebased information, and results of medically and scientifically peerreviewed studies and developments to respond to COVID. Much more politicized and stigmatized are the discourses on the origins of COVID. At the onset of the spread of this novel coronavirus, politicization and stigmatization of this viral disease have been omnipresent. It has been more than a year, and rapid strides are being made in COVID response, and yet the virus is still equated with a specific race, ancestry, culture or even a country. This whole scenario has even given rise to hate crimes. To my mind, it is critical to assert that China and its populace are not the enemy. COVID is the enemy. All stakeholders, including China, have collectively worked together in responding to the virus. It has constantly been said that no one is safe until everyone is safe. This is the adage for mutual trust and cooperation in addressing the impact of COVID. China has been cooperating with various countries and international organizations such as the World Health Organization in addressing this pandemic.

If we base our collective efforts, such as the research and development of vaccines against COVID, on evidencebased and scientific processes and findings, then the origintracing study conducted by global experts should be perceived and understood in a similar way. Reflecting deeply on the loss of lives and sacrifices of a multitude of community members working together to resolve the consequences of COVID should lead us in rectifying our intentions and focusing our energies on the essential matters in life during this pandemic. This essentiality is that all lives matter. Definitely, further joint studies in origintracing are important, particularly through global collaboration and cooperation rather than accusations and fingerpointing. It should be done based on science and facts. Any politicization will undermine the whole purpose. It would also undermine the real intent of saving all lives. Again, the enemy is the virus. It is truly more important to work together to end this pandemic. We dont have much time to waste, given that the pandemic is still raging in many parts of the world. We should prioritize all lives. We should not blame one race for this virus. Any political maneuvering or dispositions that directly contradict or affect saving all lives should not be used as a means of ending this pandemic. With this point in mind, let us focus our efforts on studying the variants of COVID and jointly undertake studies in responding to these variants with new evidencebased medications and treatment. In parallel, research and development of vaccines should continue to address the emerging health threats of these variants of COVID. Vaccination accessibility, affordability and confidence should be made more robust. Vaccination remains our best hope but we need to make vaccines accessible and affordable, especially for the poor and vulnerable. All lives matter in this fight against COVID. Chinas greater efforts in sharing its vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm with the rest of the world, while also facing a monumental task of vaccinating more than a billion people of its own, are a true example of solidarity and friendship. Through our strong partnership in the fight against the pandemic, well emerge stronger together The author is deputy secretarygeneral of ASEAN for SocioCultural Community.
