Photo provided to China Daily    With just under a month to go until the Tokyo Games, Chinas Olympians are confident of a safe and successful trip to Japan thanks to the support and protection they are receiving from the nation. All of the national team athletes are vaccinated, and the General Administration of Sport of China has provided us with the best protection, artistic gymnast Xiao Ruoteng told China Daily at the launch ceremony for Team Chinas Tokyo Olympics podium uniform, produced by Anta. So we dont have too much to worry about in terms of the safety of the Tokyo Olympics. Many international sports leagues are returning. Im very confident of a successful Tokyo Games. The yearold Xiao will be making his Olympic debut in Tokyo after missing the  Rio Games because of injury. Naturally, he is feeling a little nervous as the Games approach, but he also exudes a quiet confidence that he will be donning Antas new Team China gear on the podium in Tokyo. Im recovering well from my injuries. Im in good condition and I will present the best version of myself in Tokyo, Xiao added. We just finished our training in Shanghai. We are in good physical and mental shape, and overall were in great spirits. Our goal is to stand on the podium at the Tokyo Olympics. As for my rivals, I think my biggest opponent is myself. The challenge is to show the best of me on the biggest stage. Like thousands of athletes across the globe, Xiao should have fulfilled his dream of participating in the Olympics last year, only for the COVID pandemic to force the postponement of the Games. He admits that extra year has been hugely challenging. The postponement of the Olympics has had huge impact on us. We had a very comprehensive plan for the Tokyo Games, but the pandemic disrupted our preparations and we had to readjust, said Xiao. It was hard for us, but we have all made major adjustments and devised new arrangements. The Olympics are almost here and now we feel the pressure. Honestly, Im a little bit nervous, but the team is helping us cope. Taekwondo star Zhao Shuai, who won gold in the kilogram class at the  Rio Games, also found the postponement tough to deal with at first. However, the yearold says he is now feeling good about his chances in Tokyo. I had to adjust my mentality and change my training plans. The coach helped me to adjust, and now everything is back on the right track, said Zhao at Fridays ceremony. I feel Im in great condition now and Im really looking forward to the Tokyo Games. We didnt have a chance to participate in international competitions, but we know a lot about our rivals through watching videos. Weve kept analyzing them. I have confidence in myself, but I dont want to think too much about the result. All we need to do is to make the best preparations we can and I will try my best in Tokyo. Nations support Athletes are also drawing confidence from the support of the nation and all sectors of society. Take Anta, for example. As an official partner of the Chinese Olympic Committee, the sportswear giant has designed Team Chinas podium uniform for Tokyo, and will kit out numerous national teams across a wide variety of sports at the Games. Working with the Chinese Olympic Committee for  years, Anta has invested over  billion yuan  million into the research and development of sportswear technology, and has provided sportswear to  Chinese national teams at various Olympic Games. Anta also launched several specially designed sports gear on Friday. The fiber used in its custommade weightlifting shoes, for example, is . times stronger than the regular materials. The podium uniform, however, was the undoubted star of Fridays show. Designed by Oscarwinning art director Ye Jintian, aka Tim Yip, the costumes earned a resounding thumbsup from all the athletes in attendance. I feel good about the new Team China uniform. The design is really creative. It looks really good, and the details really impressed me, said Zhao. I hope to wear this great uniform to stand on the highest podium at the Tokyo Olympics. Xiao concurred, saying The design is different from previous editions. Also it integrates a lot of elements from traditional Chinese culture. Legendary boxer Zou Shiming, who won light flyweight golds at the  Beijing and  London Games, also attended Fridays ceremony. The yearold said The design and quality of the Team China uniforms are improving year after year, said Zou. The current generation of Chinese athletes enjoy a better training environment and better technology. I know the nations boxing team has been preparing for the Tokyo Olympics the best they can in the face of all the difficulties presented by the pandemic. I believe they will bring back surprises.
