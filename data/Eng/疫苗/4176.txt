Experts are warning that widespread belief in COVID conspiracy theories could make vaccination campaigns less effective when treatments become available.An international study led by Cambridge University psychologists and social scientists revealed that conspiracy theories linked to the pandemic are widespread, and that people who believe in such misinformation might be less likely to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.Certain misinformation claims are consistently seen as reliable by substantial sections of the public, said Sander van der Linden, director of the Cambridge Social DecisionMaking Lab and coauthor on the paper. We find a clear link between believing coronavirus conspiracies and hesitancy around any future vaccine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
