PhotoAgencies    NEW YORK  Coronavirus infections and hospitalizations resulting from the virus have hit a sixmonth high in the United States, fueled by the rapid spread of the Delta variant across swathes of the country with low vaccination rates. Nationwide, COVID cases have averaged , for three days in a row, up  percent over the past week, according to a Reuters tally of public health data. Louisiana, Florida and Arkansas reported the most new cases in the past week, based on population. Despite the surge in infections, neighboring Canada on Monday reopened its long southern border to vaccinated US citizens wanting to travel for everything from shopping to vacations. Visitors must also show proof they have tested negative for COVID, among other conditions. The US has not reciprocated the gesture.

Deaths, a lagging indicator, have registered an  percent uptick in the past week. The intensifying spread of the pandemic has led to the cancellation of some large highprofile events. One notable exception is an annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, which has been proceeding as planned. Florida set a singleday record with , cases on Sunday, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hospitalizations in Florida have been at record highs for eight days in a row, according to the Reuters analysis. Younger patients The number of children hospitalized with COVID is rising across the country, a trend health experts attribute to the Delta variant being more likely to infect children than the original Alpha strain. With the virus once again upending peoples lives after a brief summer lull in the US, the push to vaccinate those still reluctant has gained fresh momentum. In the latest development, the Pentagon on Monday said that it will seek US President Joe Bidens approval to require military personnel to get vaccinated by the middle of September. In Australia, the state of New South Wales saw another disastrous day with a record daily high of  new local cases and four deaths on Tuesday. What is more concerning is that around a third of the new locally acquired infections were among people moving about in communities while infectious. Among the four deaths, three cases were linked to the current outbreak triggered by the Delta variant and one case got infected overseas, the state authorities said. Despite the steady climb in local transmissions, the state government is reluctant to further tighten restrictions. State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she would not take any strategies that arent going to work. Agencies  Xinhua
