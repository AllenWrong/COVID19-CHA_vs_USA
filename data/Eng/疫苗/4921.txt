The newspaper cited the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, saying volunteer recruitment ended by March  midnight. A singlecenter, open and doseescalation phase I clinical trial for recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine adenoviral vector will be tested in healthy adults aged between  and  years, according to the ChiCTR. The trial, led by experts from the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, gained its approval on March  and the research is expected to last half a year. Requiring at least  participants, the trial will be conducted in Wuhan, capital of Hubei, the hardesthit region in the country. Participants will experience day quarantine restrictions after being vaccinated and their health condition will be recorded every day. Chinese scientists have been racing to develop COVID vaccines through five approaches, namely inactivated vaccines, genetic engineering subunit vaccines, adenovirus vector vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, and vaccines using attenuated influenza virus as vectors. So far, most teams are expected to complete preclinical research in April and some are moving forward faster, according to Wang Junzhi, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Wang noted that research and development of COVID vaccines in China was not slower than foreign counterparts and has been carried out in a scientific, standardized and orderly way.
