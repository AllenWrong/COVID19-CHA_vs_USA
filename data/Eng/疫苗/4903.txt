The international community needs to better consolidate its efforts and transcend all possible differences to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic, a common enemy facing all mankind, said speakers at the latest edition of Vision China. Jointly organized by China Daily and Tsinghua University, the event, titled Fighting COVID We are all together was broadcast online to a global audience on Tuesday. Public health security is a common challenge facing all countries, and COVID is the common enemy of all mankind, Chen Xu, the chairwoman of the Tsinghua University Council, said while addressing the opening. Solidarity and cooperation are the most powerful weapons to fight the virus, and the only effective course of action, she said. Zhou Shuchun, publisher and editorinchief of China Daily, said the fastspreading pandemic has put all people in the same boat. President Xi Jinping has stated since the onset of the epidemic that China upholds the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind and calls for nations to unite in building a community of common health. This is a time for unity and solidarity, Zhou said in his opening remarks. This is a time for reason and responsibility. He said the sacrifices made by the Chinese people have served to stem the transmission of the virus, which gave the rest of the world precious time to prepare for the looming crisis. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to the directorgeneral of the World Health Organization, said he was impressed by Chinas efforts to fight the outbreak after he visited the country in February. The Chinese peoples sense of social responsibility, which is embedded in the nations culture, and their experiences in fighting the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in  are key elements of Chinas fight against the virus, he said. Whats more, Chinas responses in terms of speedy diagnosis, isolation and treatment have effectively helped to contain the outbreak. Aylward stressed that when the WHO names diseases like COVID, it always tries to avoid attaching it to a place or to a country because this does not help, as global understanding and cooperation need to be fostered. He Yafei, a senior veteran diplomat, said the global response to the pandemic has been very much fragmented, and called for more solidarity and unity. Some take one kind of measure which is more leisurely, the other maybe more restrictive. There are no coordinated, concerted actions to show that we are in this together, He, a former viceminister of foreign affairs and former viceminister of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council, said in his speech. Robert Kuhn, a renowned China expert and a recipient of the China Reform Friendship Medal, said nations will collectively win when fighting together against the virus, and will collectively lose when they argue and blame each other. Containing the global pandemic, like bolstering the global economy, depends on USChina collaboration, he said. Kuhn said the two countries can either work together to fight the pandemic, developing drugs and vaccines to kill and stop COVID, or suffer an outofcontrol global pandemic and a chainreaction cratering of the global economy. Nourish the virus with USChina competition. Or starve the virus with USChina cooperation, he said. Jim ONeill, chair of the international think tank Chatham House and a former commercial secretary to the UK Treasury, said that the world economy is facing a crisis even bigger than in , and a more complicated situation because this crisis is triggered by public health instead of simply economics. We need urgency, imagination and determination around the world, and if we do not, the recession the world inevitably already got into in the past few weeks will end up being very severe, he said in his speech. Also speaking at the event were two people who stayed in Wuhan, the Chinese city hit hardest by the virus. Zhang Ruiru, a yearold Tsinghua University student, went back to her home city of Wuhan for the traditional Lunar New Year holiday. Both of her parents were later diagnosed with the infection and have recovered. Zhang said the fight against the outbreak has made her fully realize the strong unity of the Chinese people. Megan Monroe from the United States, who has been working as a teacher in Wuhan, decided to stay in the city and started to post videos online since the first day of the citys lockdown on Jan . I think that everyone needs to look at other countries and especially look toward China to see what China has done for this virus, because we can only overcome this together. The event on Tuesday was the th Vision China event since its launch in . Each event has featured global opinion leaders invited to discuss Chinese topics of international significance. cuijiachinadaily.com.cn         Bruce Aylward             Zhang Ruiru             Megan Monroe             Jim ONeill             He Yafei             Robert Kuhn             VISION CHINA Scan the QR code for video from the event more coverage at chinadaily.com.cnworldspecialcoveragevisionchina             Zhou Shuchun, publisher and editorinchief of China Daily             Chen Xu, chairperson of Tsinghua University Council                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
