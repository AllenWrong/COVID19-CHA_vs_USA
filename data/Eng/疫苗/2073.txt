PhotoAgencies    Europes medicines regulator said on Tuesday it has started a realtime review of Sinovacs COVID vaccine, based on preliminary results from animal and human trials that suggested the vaccine produces an immune response against the coronavirus. Data on the vaccine, COVID Vaccine Vero Cell Inactivated, will be assessed as they are made available to help speed up potential approvals, the European Medicines Agency EMA said. This is the first Chinese vaccine the EMA is studying in realtime, and the fourth COVID vaccine under such a review, including those from CureVac, Novavax Inc and Russias Sputnik V. Sinovacs vaccine has shown efficacy rates between  percent and  percent in different studies and is currently authorised for use in China, Indonesia, Brazil and Turkey. The vaccine contains inactivated or dead versions of the SARSCoV virus to help the human bodys immune system make antibodies. In early April, Sinovac said its third production plant for its vaccine, branded CoronaVac in some regions, was ready, doubling its annual capacity to  billion doses. The firm said more than  million doses of Sinovacs vaccine have been delivered globally. Rolling reviews are aimed at speeding up the approval process by allowing researchers to submit findings in realtime before final trial data is available. Reuters
