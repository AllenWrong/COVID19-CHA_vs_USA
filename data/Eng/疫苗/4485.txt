US President Donald Trump on Wednesday turned what was expected to be a briefing on the novel coronavirus pandemic into a lengthy attack on China and former vicepresident Joe Biden, who is leading him in most national polls in the race for president.Trump said on Monday that he planned to make pandemic briefings a regular fixture in the White House briefing room again after his monthslong hiatus from participating in daily updates.But on Wednesday, in the second day since the briefings resumed, for the better part of an hour in front of reporters in the White House Rose Garden, Trump gave what was largely a live political advertisement for his reelection campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
