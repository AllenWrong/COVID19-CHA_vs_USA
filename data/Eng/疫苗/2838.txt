Toxic newsletter of EU undermines global solidarity against pandemic
2021-03-12 00:00
Countries politicizing the novel coronavirus and playing blame games have made the pandemic a much worse global health crisis than it should be. That is true for the United States, a superpower that has the highest numbers of COVID cases and deaths.  As the world sees a light at the end of the tunnel with the rolling out of COVID vaccines, vaccine nationalismfor instance, rich countries with only  percent of the global population buying up  percent of the worlds vaccine supplyhas become a new, major challenge in the global fight against the virus.  A March  newsletter by European Council President Charles Michel on the European Unions vaccine activities smacks of both vaccine nationalism and pandemic politicization. In the newsletter, Michel has admitted that the EU preordered more than  billion doses of vaccines for its population of about  million but dismissed the criticism that the EU is indulging in vaccine nationalism, saying the European bloc will give the surplus to its partner countries and regions.  But that will likely be by the end of this year or sometimes next year after everyone in the EU is inoculated.  The EU is indeed a major fund contributor to the global vaccine initiative COVAX. But World Health Organization DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has urged rich countries to share doses immediately, saying if there are no vaccines to buy, money is irrelevant. He criticized the rich countries for vaccinating younger and healthier adults at lower risk of infection ahead of health workers and elderly people in developing countries.  Ironically, Michel lauded the EUs excessive purchase of vaccines for its  member states, emphasizing that it was necessary to avoid creating firstand secondclass European citizens which he called unacceptable.  The European Council chief disagreed with the fact that the EUs export control of vaccines is a form of vaccine nationalism. Instead, he blamed the US and the United Kingdom for imposing outright ban on vaccine exports, drawing instant rebuke from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  Michel also took a cheap shot at China and Russia, accusing the two countries of having less desirable values than ours and administered half as many doses per  inhabitants as the EU. Europe will not use vaccines for propaganda purposes. We promote our values, he said.  This is probably the most toxic rhetoric about the response to the pandemic by a European leader.  Michel has claimed that by joining forces, the EU and the US will demonstrate that liberal democracies are most effective in overcoming the current pandemic.  But is he aware that the responses of the US and the EU to the pandemic are among the worst in the world based on the numbers of cases and deaths? Contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, the most effective weapons adopted by China and other countries in East Asia against the pandemic, are largely nonexistent in Europe.  China is still behind the EU in vaccination per  people. But China, despite its . billion population, has an extremely low rate of new infection, and has been almost back on the normal track for many months, unlike the EU or the US.  The fact that China has supplied vaccines to  developing countries for emergency use, exported vaccines to  countries and pledged  million vaccine doses to COVAX conforms to the WHOs guideline that no one is safe until everyone is safe.  Tedros cited the example of the US and the Soviet Union working together in eradicating smallpox during the Cold War as ideal global cooperation. He has repeatedly said that the virus knows no politics and ideology, words that Michel seems to disagree with.  True, EU leaders are under great pressure from member states for the slow and sometimes chaotic vaccine rollout. But by trying to deflect criticism by creating distractions, politicizing the vaccines and playing blame games, Michel is undermining global solidarity which is vital to overcome the pandemic.  chenweihuachinadaily.com.cn         Chen Weihua                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
