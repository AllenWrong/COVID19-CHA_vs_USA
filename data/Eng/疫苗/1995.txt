US illwilled moves against Huawei harm itself and global supply chains
2021-05-13 00:00
Republican Senator Roger Wickers ongoing factfinding process into whether leading global suppliers are supplying Huawei with foreignproduced hard disk drives to circumvent the US Commerce Departments restrictions represents the latest attempt of the US side to politicize and disturb normal business activities. Wicker, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, also copied Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo into the letter he sent to the chief executives of Toshiba America, Electronic Components, Seagate Technology and Western Digital Corp, urging her to act against any company found to be circumventing any part of the regulations the department rolled out during the Donald Trump administration. The senator may seem to be actively fulfilling his duty as a lawmaker of the country. But what he is really doing is a disservice to the US, and beyond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
