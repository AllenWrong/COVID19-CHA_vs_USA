PROGRESS NOT UNIFORM The sevenday average dipped to , on Friday, the lowest since June  and less than a tenth of the infection rate during the winter surge, according to state health department data compiled by The Washington Post. The pandemic map remains speckled with hot spots, including parts of the Deep South, the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest. At the local level, progress against the contagion has not been uniform as some communities struggle with inequities in vaccine distribution and in the health impacts of the virus, said the Post on Saturday. The vast bulk of the American landscape has turned pale green, the colorcode for low or moderate viral burden, in a COVID Community Profile Report released this week by the Biden administration. The report showed  counties still have high levels of transmission, less than half as many as in midApril. The big question now is whether the virus will be thoroughly squelched through mounting vaccinations, or whether it will smolder in areas with low immunization rates and potentially flare when colder weather returns, David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, was quoted as saying. The lab has been modeling the outbreak for more than a year.
