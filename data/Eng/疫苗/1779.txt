Middle East eyeing digital health passports
2021-06-01 00:00
Citing robust smartphone penetration and a burgeoning technology sector, experts believe the Middle East is well placed to adopt COVID digital health passports, which are deemed key to restoring hasslefree travel and resuscitating the embattled tourism sector.  Countries like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have dedicated enormous resources to digital transformation, said Mohammed Soliman, an expert from the Middle East Institutes Cyber Program and a senior associate at Washingtonbased advisory firm McLarty Associates.  As a result of the success of COVID tracking apps, the Gulf nations now have the necessary experience and digital infrastructure to embrace digital health passports in the postvaccine era, he said.  Saudi Arabia reopened land, sea and air borders on May  for immunized citizens.  The UAE capital, Abu Dhabi, recently updated its Green List of countries, regions and territories to , the Gulf News reported. Passengers arriving from these destinations are exempt from mandatory quarantine measures after landing in Abu Dhabi.  Soliman said the Persian Gulf states have been witnessing a historically high social media smartphone penetration rate.  Smartphone subscriber rates in the Middle East and North Africa are the highest in the Gulf Cooperation Council subregion, with countries like the UAE reaching  percent, according to German research firm Statista.  In February, Bahrain was one of the first countries in the world to launch a digital COVID tracking app with BeAware Bahrain. Saudi Arabias Tawakkalna app aids contacttracing efforts, while the UAEs Alhosn app allows users to check their COVID test results on their phones.  In May, the UAE and Bahrain established a safe travel corridor for vaccinated people as part of the two countries cooperation on pandemic recovery.  A survey by travel technology company Amadeus found that  percent of UAE travelers would happily use a digital health passport. Gen X ages  to  travelers were more receptive to the idea than Gen Zages  to  at  percent and  percent, respectively.  Rob Golledge, Amadeus head of corporate communications for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said the company chose the UAE for its research because it is an important regional hub that has a dynamic travel industry.  The UAE and other countries in the region have young populations compared with some Western European countries. This tends to have a positive effect on their appetite and willingness to travel, he said.  The study revealed UAE travelers two main concerns are personal information being hacked  percent, and a lack of transparency and control over where their data is shared  percent.  Soliman said There are two points of views on the question of privacy. First, people have the absolute freedom to make their own choicetaking or not taking the vaccine second, vaccine passports would provide us with a quicker return to normal and minimize the risks involved with returning to prepandemic life.  Maya Senussi, a senior economist for the Middle East at Oxford Economics, said with countries in the region cautiously easing entry restrictions, most are still weighing up the options of how to reopen more broadly in a safe way.  Given the economic importance of travel and tourism, several airlines, including Emirates and Qatar Airways, have been trialing mobile health apps, such as IATAs Travel Pass, in the hope their adoption spurs a travel rebound, Senussi said.  The International Air Transport Associations Travel Pass trial has  participating airlines, including the UAEs Emirates and Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, Bahrains Gulf Air and Saudi Arabias Saudia. Kuwaits Jazeera Airways joined in May.  The pass is designed to ensure accurate travel, testing and vaccine requirement information and identify health centers at departure locations that meet testing and vaccination standards. There are benefits of digital vaccine certificates as a way to overcome some travel hurdles but there might understandably be concerns, including over identifiable personal data being electronically accessible, Senussi said.  Industry leaders have also cautioned that digital health passports might leave those ineligible for vaccines behind.  The World Travel and Tourism Council does not believe there should be discrimination against those yet to be immunized or those who are unable to receive the vaccine, said Virginia Messina, senior vicepresident of the council, adding that producing a negative COVID test must be allowed as an alternative.  janchinadailyapac.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
