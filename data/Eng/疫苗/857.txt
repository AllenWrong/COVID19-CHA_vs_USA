A major vaccine center in the United Kingdom is working on combining the flu and COVID vaccines into a single shot, in a move that could streamline manufacturing and speed up rollout.Matthew Duchars, the chief executive of the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre, or VMIC, said the development of a socalled combination vaccine for the flu and COVID could greatly ease the logistical burden of responding to recurrent outbreaks of both diseases.It will save a lot of time and it would be a lot more convenient to just give one shot, so it is something that we and vaccine developers and producers will be looking at, said Duchars to The Telegraph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
