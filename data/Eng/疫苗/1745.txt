Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said the DPP authority was trying to shift the blame and make the mainland their scapegoat. The mainland has repeatedly expressed willingness to try its best to help Taiwan compatriots fight the virus, and help them use the WHOendorsed mainland vaccines as soon as possible, Ma said. The DPP authority itself should be blamed for its failed purchase of German vaccines because it violated the normal purchase procedures and basic business rules.
