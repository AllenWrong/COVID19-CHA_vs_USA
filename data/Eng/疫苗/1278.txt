Along with the tourism industry, the aviation sector has been badly hit by the COVID pandemic, grounding aircraft on the tarmac as containment measures and travel bans were put in place. During the second wave of outbreaks in early , the number of commercial flights decreased sharply by about  percent compared to the prepandemic levels in , according to Eurostat. In June, however, the number of commercial flights went back significantly to only  percent less than two years ago, thanks to the vaccination campaign and the ease of lockdowns in the EU. Now that it is much easier to travel within the Mediterranean space and in Europe, we see a strong increase in demand, said Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air FranceKLM, to French radio Europe  last week. Air FranceKLM planes departing from France towards trendy touristic destinations such as Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, are full, said Smith. As European airlines are on the way to recovery for intraEU travel, it is another story altogether when it comes to longhaul flights and extraEU travels. Routes towards Asia and Latin America are still closed, said Smith. The EU launched a Digital COVID Certificate on July , aiming to facilitate travels within the Schengen area and restart the tourism industry. The bloc is currently in talks with the United States and some other countries for mutual recognition of vaccine certificates.
