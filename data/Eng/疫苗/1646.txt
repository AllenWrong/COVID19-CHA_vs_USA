WASHINGTON  Many scientists, including top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci, still believe that COVID most likely occurred in nature and jumped from animals to humans, according to The Associated Press on Wednesday.No new key scientific evidence that might make the lableak hypothesis more likely has been publicly identified by virus researchers, it added.The World Health Organization said in March that COVID introduction through a laboratory incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway, refuting lableak theories.The great probability is still that this virus came from a wildlife reservoir, said Arinjay Banerjee, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatchewan, Canada, according to the report.Spillover events  when viruses jump from animals to humans  are common in nature, and have been seen in previous cases, he said.Many scientists believe that its unlikely the day investigation by the intelligence community at the request of US President Joe Biden will yield definitive new answers, the report added.
