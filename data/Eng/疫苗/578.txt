US President Joe Biden and the visiting prime ministers of Australia, India and Japan are scheduled to meet in the White House on Sept  at what will be the first inperson summit of the leaders of the socalled Quad countries. According to the White House, their discussions will be focused on deepening our ties and advancing practical cooperation on areas such as combating COVID, addressing the climate crisis, partnering on emerging technologies and cyberspace, and promoting a free and open IndoPacific. There is nothing wrong with countries seeking to improve their relations, let alone collaborating on global concerns such as the pandemic and the gathering storm of climate change, which are difficult to address without concerted international efforts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
