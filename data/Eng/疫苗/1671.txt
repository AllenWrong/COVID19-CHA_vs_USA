The leaders made their appeal ahead of a G summit in England which begins on Friday, when US President Joe Biden will meet the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. In their letter to the G, the former world leaders said global cooperation had failed in , but that  could usher in a new era. Support from the G and G that makes vaccines readily accessible to low and middleincome countries is not an act of charity, but rather is in every countrys strategic interest, the letter said. Among the signatories were exBritish premiers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, former UN Secretary General BanKi Moon and  former African leaders. They said the G and other leaders invited to the summit should guarantee to pay what would amount to about  billion a year over two years towards fighting the pandemic worldwide. For the G to pay is not charity, it is selfprotection to stop the disease spreading, mutating and returning to threaten all of us, Brown said. Costing just  pence . per person per week in the UK, is a small price to pay a for the best insurance policy in the world, he added in a statement. Their plea coincided with a poll by the Save the Children charity which found strong public support in the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Canada for the G paying towards the  billion needed for COVID vaccines globally. In Britain,  were in favour of such a policy, while  of Americans backed the proposal, the poll showed. Support was lowest in France, where  were in favour. Reuters
