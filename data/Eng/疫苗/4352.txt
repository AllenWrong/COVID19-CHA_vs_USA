The trial primarily is designed to determine if AZD can prevent symptomatic COVID after two doses. The United Kingdombased global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is leading the trial as regulatory sponsor. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID, part of the NIH, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority are providing funding support for the trial.
