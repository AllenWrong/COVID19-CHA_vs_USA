Wang, from Tongji Hospital, said that although progress has been made in fighting novel coronavirus in Wuhan, people should not underestimate the risks of the virus, as much remains unknown about it. No effective drug or vaccine is available, and it is very important to provide good care for patients with milder cases so they do not become seriously ill, which can result multiple organ failure, he said.
