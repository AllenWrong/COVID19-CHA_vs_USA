Spokesperson Ren Guoqiang told a press conference in Beijing that a group of military experts was sent to Wuhan, the hardesthit city by the coronavirus in Central Chinas Hubei province, on Jan . Four days later, they began coronavirus testing using independentlydeveloped test kits in a mobile lab while continuing vaccine research. On March , a recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine developed by a research team led by Chen Wei, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a researcher at the Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, passed a review by authorities and was greenlighted for clinical trials. This marked a major breakthrough in the countrys COVID response, Ren noted. The military experts will advance their research in strict accordance with international norms and domestic regulations to ensure the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine, Ren said.
