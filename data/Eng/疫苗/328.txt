That was  billion less than the record .trilliondollar deficit in the prior fiscal year, reflecting an improved economy due in part to the American Rescue Plan Act of  and COVID vaccination rollout, the department said. Todays joint budget statement is further evidence that Americas economy is in the midst of a recovery, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement, adding the economic recovery is still fragile. In order to build upon the progress that has been made and to ensure the success of our businesses, productivity of our workers, and inclusiveness of our system, Congress should pass President Joe Bidens Build Back Better plan, Yellen said. However, divisions remain among the Democratic Party over Bidens massive social spending plan, which will have to be cut from the original .trilliondollar goal. By the time it is finished, the legislation will be far less ambitious than the president and progressive lawmakers had hoped, according to local media. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said that the high deficit in FY  comes as little surprise since the COVID public health and economic crisis caused revenue to fall and spending to rise over the past year. However, it will contribute to high debt that will stay with us over the longterm. Similarly, lawmakers must focus on creating a longterm plan to reduce deficits, the watchdog group said.
