PhotoXinhua    Taiwan minister of health Chen Shihchung, who is also heading the fight against the novel coronavirus on the island, recently claimed that they planned to buy  million doses of COVID vaccines from Germanybased BioNTech company, but the deal fell through because of opposition from the Chinese mainland. However, reports show that the Shanghaibased Fosun Group had inked a deal with BNT in March , making it its exclusive agent in China, Taiwan region included. So how could Taiwan bypass this exclusive agent to buy the vaccines? Clearly, it is a case of Chen trying to break commercial rules and not the mainland imposing any political terms. In her address ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year, Taiwan leader Tsai Ingwen said that the key to crossStraits peace lies with the mainland. Tsais remarks are beyond absurd. CrossStraits relations improved from  to  because both sides adhered to the  Consensus. But Tsai refused to recognize the consensus on assuming power in . It is Tsais and her Democratic Progressive Partys actions that have given rise to tensions, so why put the blame on the mainland? The day Tsai made those remarks, a media outlet in Taiwan held a survey in which over  percent of the , people surveyed said they believed crossStraits tensions will continue. Tsai and Chen are spreading falsehoods to cover up their own failures. Despite making tall claims about RD and purchasing vaccines, Chen has not directly managed a single vaccine shot on the island. While running for office, Tsai talked about maintaining the status quo with the mainland, but soon after being sworn in she sought independence. After doing everything to upset peace and stability in the Straits, she now wants the mainland to shoulder the blame. However, blaming the mainland will not solve the islands problems. Cooperation on the basis of the  Consensus is the only way to a better future.
