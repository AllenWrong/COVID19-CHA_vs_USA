US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, would be issuing an emergency use authorization, or EUA, for blood plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID as a treatment for the disease.Speaking at the White House a day before the Republican National Convention begins in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump said the authorization will dramatically expand access to the treatment.He said that the socalled convalescent plasma has been proven to reduce mortality by  percent, which he called a tremendous number.Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, speaking after Trump, said We dream in drug development of something like a  percent mortality reduction. This is a major advance in the treatment of patients.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told reporters earlier that the agency was encouraged by the early promising data that weve seen.Hahn made clear the EUA was not the same as FDA approval and that the treatment still needs to undergo randomized clinical trials.The agency issues an EUA when it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective and the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks.The treatment, which has already been received by more than , patients, has shown some benefits, but without rigorous trials, questions remain about its actual safety, effectiveness and appropriate dosage. Trials to date have been hampered by delays and trouble finding volunteers.Peter Marks, the director of FDAs center for biologics, evaluation and research, said the decision was based on data that suggested that when given early in the course of the disease, plasma can improve outcomes and decrease mortality.Were confident that convalescent plasma is safe to use in this setting, he said.More data neededThe authorization comes less than a week after officials at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, staged a rare intervention to stop the FDA from issuing the EUA.NIH officials told The New York Times that more data from randomized controlled trials was needed before an EUA could be issued.Trump has been pushing officials for the EUA and seemed to accuse federal health officials of deliberately delaying approval for treatments and vaccines until after the November election.I hear great things about convalescent plasma treatment ... thats all I can tell you, said Trump on Wednesday at a White House news briefing.It could be a political decision because you have a lot of people over there who dont want to rush things because they want to do it after Nov , and youve heard that one before.Asked by a reporter on Sunday about the delay in issuing the EUA, Trump said There are people in the FDA and actually in your larger department Health and Human Services that can see things being held up and wouldnt mind so muchits my opinion, a very strong opinionand thats for political reasons.Trump has touted the blood plasma treatment as a beautiful ingredient. Last month the administration launched an  million ad campaign to encourage those who have recovered from COVID to donate plasma.Since the start of pandemic, the FDA has issued dozens of EUAs, mostly for diagnostic tests but also some treatments. But sometimes, as with the antimalaria drug hydroxychloroquine championed by Trump as a COVID treatment, further studies found them to be ineffective and possibly harmful. In the case of hydroxychloroquine, the EUA was rescinded by the FDA.andrewcohenchinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
