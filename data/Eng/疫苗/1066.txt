PhotoIC    BEIJING  A third shot of Sinovac COVID vaccine administered six months or more after the second dose will give a remarkable boost to peoples immunity against the deadly virus, a new study has found. The study was published on Medrxiv.org on Sunday for peer review. Chinese researchers inoculated over  participants with a third dose six to eight months after their second jabs, and they found that the additional shot will lead to a big increase in antibody levels, with geometric mean titers assessed  days later increasing to ., or approximately threefold. The study also found that although neutralizing antibody levels declined six months after two Sinovac shots, a twodose schedule generates good immune memory. The research is consistent with recent studies over booster immunization with the AstraZeneca vaccine, which have showed higher concentrations of total antibodies after a third dose.
