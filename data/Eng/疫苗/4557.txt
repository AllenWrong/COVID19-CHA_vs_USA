More than  million people could be on the brink of starvation by the end of this year. Routine immunization services are being disrupted on an unprecedented scale, raising the likelihood of major outbreaks of diseases, and healthcare workers and humanitarian personnel have themselves been targeted for unconscionable attacks, he said. These wideranging risks require an urgent and united response, including from the Security Council, he said at a virtual open debate titled Maintenance of International Peace and Security Pandemics and Security held by the Security Council. The highlevel debate, convened by Germany, which is Security Council president for July, follows the councils passage on Wednesday of Resolution  , which demands a general and immediate cessation of hostilities in all situations on its agenda.
