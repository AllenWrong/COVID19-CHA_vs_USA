On Tuesday, White House health adviser Anthony Fauci said the epidemic in the US isnt over yet. He said vaccines will be the only way to stop the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the federal government plans to fund and conduct trials of three experimental vaccines starting this summer.

Meanwhile, various media reported on Wednesday that the Republican National Committee is expected to choose Jacksonville, Florida, as the new location for the main events of its national convention in August. Two years ago, the party chose Charlotte, North Carolina, but state officials there declined to promise the Republicans a packed arena for their Aug  convention, citing public health concerns. President Donald Trump has said he wants to accept his partys nomination before a large crowd, so his party sought a location that wouldnt insist on face coverings and social distancing. The conventions more routine and lowerprofile meetings reportedly would still take place in Charlotte to honor the partys contractual obligation to hold its convention in North Carolina and shield it from lawsuits for moving the banner events elsewhere. aihepingchinadailyusa.com         People dine in the Freeport Nautical Mile area of Long Island, New York, on Wednesday.
