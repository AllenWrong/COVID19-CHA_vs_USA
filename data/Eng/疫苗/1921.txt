America ordered enough vaccines to vaccinate its population twice, while many other countries are still struggling to secure them, CBS said, adding that many nations struggling to get vaccines have turned to other world powers like China and Russia to secure doses. With about  percent of the worlds population, the United States has hoarded about . billion doses of vaccines, a quarter of the global total. US President Joe Biden on Monday announced that his country will send  million doses of COVID vaccines to other countries. Thats in addition to the  million doses of AstraZenecas COVID vaccine Washington promised to be delivered aboard by July. US foreign policy expert Eyck Freymann was quoted by CBS as saying the situation has left many countries helpless. They can see it in the headlines that Americans are taking off their masks and getting back to normal life, and yet their grandmother is getting sick because she couldnt get a vaccine, he said.
