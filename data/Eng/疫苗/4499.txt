PARKER ZHENG  CHINA DAILY    Two medical specialists are recommending that the Hong Kong government adopt a curfew and perhaps even a lockdown as the city faces growing pressure to contain a worsening third wave of the COVID pandemic. Yuen Kwokyung, a leading microbiologist in Hong Kong, said the authority should consider imposing a citywide curfew or a lockdown to prevent people from leaving their homes if the number of confirmed cases continues to rise in the next seven to  days. In an interview with a local radio program, Yuen cautioned the public to put on their masks and not to relax before a vaccine is available. David Hui Shucheong, a respiratorymedicine expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said in a different radio interview that lockdown measures might be necessary if current measures fail to improve the situation. Public hospitals in Hong Kong would be overwhelmed within a week if nearly  cases were added daily and if most have an unknown origin, he said. Seventythree new infections were recorded on Monday. The SAR government announced on Sunday that a series of social distancing measures will be extended until July , including mandatory maskwearing in all indoor public areas and a ban on dining at restaurants from  pm to  am.
