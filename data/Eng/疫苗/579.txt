China and a group of likeminded countries on Tuesday voiced deep concern over the human rights violations of the United States and its allies in Afghanistan over the past two decades and have called for the perpetrators to be held accountable.  Jiang Duan, minister of the Chinese mission to the United Nations in Geneva, delivered a joint statement on behalf of the group of countries at the th session of the UN Human Rights Council being held from Sept  to Oct .  We express our deep concern that the US and its allies have conducted military intervention in Afghanistan for  years. It has severely undermined the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, compromised its economic and social development, and violated the human rights of Afghan people, Jiang said.  The joint statement said the USled military intervention was the root cause of the humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan. It cited the fact that at least , Afghan civilians had been killed and more than  million people displaced during the USled war. The conflict has also severely affected Afghanistans neighbors.  The crimes committed in Afghanistan by military personnel of the US and its allies, such as killing of civilians and torture, must be thoroughly and impartially investigated, said Jiang on behalf of the group.  He said the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that the victims deserve justice and remedy, and those countries in question must be held accountable for what they have done in the past two decades.  They have the obligation to fulfill their commitment to Afghanistans peaceful reconstruction, rather than simply walking away and shifting the burden to the international community, he said.  New type of relations  In his speech representing a group of countries, Chen Xu, Chinas permanent representative to the UN Office at Geneva, called on nations to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, refrain from imposing ones will on others and work to build a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and winwin cooperation.  Differences should be bridged through dialogue and consultation, and conflicts should be resolved through political negotiation, Chen said.  The use or threat of force should be rejected, he said, as should military intervention under the pretext of democracy and human rights.  Chen also called on promoting sustainable development to achieve peace. He said countries should respect the diversity of civilizations.  At Tuesdays session, Jiang made another joint statement on behalf of a group of countries expressing serious concern over the human rights situation in the US.  The joint statement criticized the US for disregarding the right to life and right to health of its people, saying that while the US boasts the most advanced medical equipment and technologies, it has seen the largest number of COVID cases and deaths in the world.  Instead of fighting the virus in full gear, the US government is obsessed in political manipulation of issues such as tracing virus origins in its purpose to shift blame to other countries and shirk responsibility from its own failure, he said.  The joint statement also blasted the US for its systemic racism and for blocking many countries from access to medication and vaccines during the COVID pandemic.
