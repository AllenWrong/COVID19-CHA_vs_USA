China is not interested in engaging in hegemony or replacing the United States, which has kept defaming and cracking down on China, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Wednesday. China will firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, and at the same time hopes to talk with the US so that the latter will follow the historic trend of multipolarization and democratization of international relations, and treat ties with China properly, Wang said. Wang made the remarks during a videoconference with foreign ministers of members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
