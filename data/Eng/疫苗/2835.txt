Tourists vaccinated against COVID may be allowed to take holidays in parts of Europe this summer, with several nations announcing plans built around socalled vaccine passports. Spain could give the green light to inoculated travelers by midMay, Tourism Minister Maria Reyes Maroto told the Antena  TV station on Wednesday. This follows similar announcements from authorities in Greece and Cyprus, which also aim to reboot their dormant tourism industries. Travelers will likely have to provide a recent negative test, along with proof of full vaccination coverage, in order to gain entry to select holiday destinations. This will enable us to have a clear horizon and hope so we can be more optimistic about the relaunch of international travel,Maroto told a news conference. Greek Tourism Minister Haris Theoharis said the country will launch a pilot program to begin reopening its borders in April, with a view to fully open the following month. We aim to open tourism by May , with specific rules and updated protocols. Until then we will gradually lift restrictions provided conditions linked to the pandemic permit, Theoharis said at a news conference. Greece has already agreed a vaccine passport deal with Israel, while Cyprus has said that British tourists are welcome from May , provided they are fully vaccinated. While some countries forge on with individual plans, the possibility of a European Unionwide approach is on the horizon. Later this month EU member states will debate legislation for increased movement between member states. Well present this month a legislative proposal for a Digital Green Pass, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter last week. She said that such a pass would involve proof that a person has been vaccinated, or test results for those who could not get vaccinated. Russian shot Amid criticism of the blocs slow rollout of vaccines, the EUs drugs regulator began reviewing a Russian shot for possible approval last week. Three Westernmade vaccines are already cleared for use in the bloc. Sputnik V has been approved or is being assessed for approval in EU members Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. EU officials have said Brussels could start negotiations about a possible agreement to buy the vaccine if at least four members request it. Peerreviewed latestage trial results published last month showed that the Russian vaccine was almost  percent effective. In a first for Europe, Swissbased drugmaker Adienne has agreed to make the shots in Italy. The head of Moscows RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which was behind the development of Sputnik V, said on Tuesday that more manufacturing deals had been struck with production facilities in Spain, France and Germany.
