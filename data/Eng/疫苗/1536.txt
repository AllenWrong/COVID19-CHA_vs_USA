WASHINGTON  A new study of the US National Institutes of Health NIH showed the prevalence of COVID in the United States during spring and summer of  far exceeded the known number of cases, and that infection affected the country unevenly. NIH researchers estimated that there were . undiagnosed cases for every diagnosed COVID case in this time frame, representing an additional . million cases by July alone, according to the study published on Tuesday. The team recruited over , volunteers from across the country, then selected , individuals from that pool through quota sampling to ensure that their study cohort was representative of the US population. The researchers found that  of the approximately , blood samples were seropositive, meaning that they contained antibodies against the SARSCoV virus. These analysis offered insight into the undetected spread of the virus and subgroup vulnerability to undiagnosed infection, said the NIH in a statement. The information will be invaluable as we assess the best public health measures needed to keep people safe, as new  and even more transmissible  variants emerge and vaccine antibody response changes over time, said Bruce Tromberg, director of the US National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.
