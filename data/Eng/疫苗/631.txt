In an oped in Bahrains the Daily Tribune, Anwar Habibullah said that while the international community is working hard to overcome the epidemic, the United States, out of its own interests, neglected the international consensus of fighting against COVID corporately and scientifically, said the ambassador. The socalled report on the origins of COVID compiled by the US intelligence community recently is a mendacious report made up for political purposes, stressed the ambassador. China has always followed the principles of openness, transparency, and responsibility to introduce the virus information to the world, share the genome sequence of the virus, and carry out antiepidemic cooperation. The first suspicious COVID case found in China was reported to local authorities on Dec ,  and an emergency notice was later issued. On Dec , , China reported relevant information to the World Health Organisation WHO, the diplomat said. He stressed China has demonstrated a scientific, professional, serious, and responsible attitude from the beginning, and since last year invited WHO experts twice to China to track down patient zero. Chinas open and transparent attitude on the issue of COVID origins tracing was fully affirmed by international experts, stated the envoy. Out of a sinister intention to suppress China, the United States also continued to pressure other countries and international organizations to adopt special measures against China on the issue of virus origins while China was working with global scientists and conducting largescale global humanitarian operations, the diplomat said. We have provided  billion in assistance for the COVID response and economic and social recovery in developing countries hit by the pandemic, he added. He called ChinaBahrain cooperation in the fight against COVID an outstanding example. Bahrain government took the lead in approving the registration of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine, and this cooperation played a positive role in vaccine research as well as antiepidemic cooperation in other countries. The envoy called for the nonpoliticization of scientific issues and urged all countries to unite and overcome the pandemic.
