Longondo said the epidemic, which was declared on August , , has killed , people and was the longest, most complex and deadliest in the countrys history. However, the end of the epidemic in the eastern side of the country comes hot on the heels of another outbreak that was declared on June  in the western city of Mbandaka, more than , kilometers away  even though genetic testing revealed the two epidemics were not connected.The health ministry intends to capitalize on the lessons learned and the success factors from this long epidemic to assure the most effective response possible in Mbandaka, Longondo said.In a statement released to the press, the World Health Organization congratulated all those involved in the arduous and often dangerous work required to end the outbreak, but stressed the need for vigilance.The outbreak took so much from all of us, especially from the people of DRC, but we came out of it with valuable lessons and tools.

The DRC is now better, smarter and faster at responding to Ebola and this is an enduring legacy which is supporting the response to COVID and other outbreaks, Moeti said.WHO also said it is supporting the governmentled response in the western city of Mbandaka, with more than  staff already deployed and more than , vaccinations already administered.
