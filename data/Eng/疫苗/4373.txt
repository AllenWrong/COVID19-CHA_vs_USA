Cambridge vaccine targets multiple coronaviruses

The United Kingdom government is funding clinical trials for a new vaccine candidate that could provide protection against both COVID and other pathogens in the coronavirus family.The potential vaccine, which is called DIOSCoVax, is being developed by researchers from DIOSynVax, a Cambridge University spinout company, that is using D computer modelling to create synthetic gene inserts designed to elicit an immune response against not only the novel coronavirus, but also its relatives.This means the vaccine could provide protection against multiple coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, such as SARS and MERS, as well as others that are yet to make people sick.Ultimately, we aim to make a vaccine that will not only protect from SARSCoV, but also other related coronaviruses that may spill over from animals to humans, said Jonathan Heeney, DIOSynVax founder and head of the laboratory of viral zoonotics at the University of Cambridge.DIOSynVax was established three years ago and the labs earlier work focused on another treatment with multiple targets  a socalled trivalent vaccine that has shown promise in animal trials at protecting against the Ebola, Lassa and Marburg viruses.The DIOSynVax team had also been using computer modelling techniques to create a flu vaccine candidate, allowing them to hit the ground running when the need for a COVID jab became paramount.DIOSynVax began molecular modelling of the novel coronavirus in January, just days after Chinese scientists released the first genetic sequencing data.The labs approach relies on a library of computergenerated models of coronaviruses that allows them to study the structure of the pathogens, identify key areas where the viruses interact with human cells, and spot potential weaknesses the virus may have.Using this modelling, the team has been able to produce synthetic DNA vectors, or packages of genetic information that train the immune system to block virus infection through the production of antibodies and Tcells.Our strategy includes targeting those domains of the viruss structure that are absolutely critical for docking with a cell, while avoiding the parts that could make things worse, Heeney said. What we end up with is a mimic, a synthetic part of the virus minus those nonessential elements that could trigger a bad immune response.Another advantage of DIOSCoVax is that it can be administered through the skin as a powder, rather than a more invasive needle.The UK governments innovation agency Innovate UK has provided . million pounds . million to fund clinical trials for DIOSCoVax, which will take place in late fall this year at the clinical research facility at the University Hospital Southampton National Health Service Foundation Trust.
