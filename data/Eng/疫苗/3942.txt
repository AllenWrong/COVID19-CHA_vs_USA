It is safe to say Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuetngors latest policy address contains the most demanding task for any head of the HKSAR since its establishment. Hong Kong suffered heavily from the costliest social unrest in history last year. Adding to the political turmoil and economic hardship are US trade sanctions meant to intimidate China by hurting Hong Kong. Then came the COVID pandemic, severely impacting all aspects of life. The black revolution may have ended, thanks to the National Security Law, but the pandemic is still hurting the economy seriously, along with peoples confidence in a speedy economic recovery. Public expectations for policies to contain COVID and jumpstart the economy are palpable to say the least. In her policy address, Lam puts forward  new measures, including those supported by the central government. Apparently Beijing cares for and supports the HKSAR in restoring stability and prosperity without reservation. Regarding efforts to contain COVID, the PA confirms the central governments full support for the SAR in preventing imported coronavirus from spreading and local cases from rebounding and securing the supply of COVID vaccines. Other measures include compulsory testing of highrisk groups and expanding voluntary testing of residents without symptoms. When the pandemic is under effective control in Hong Kong, the SAR government will consider mutual acceptance of the phonebased health code with Shenzhen and hopefully other mainland cities to help restore personnel exchanges, because mainland visitors will no doubt help Hong Kongs consumer services recover more quickly. Vision of a future without COVID would also help restore public confidence. Driven by needs for antipandemic technology and products, the innotech sector will play a significant role in the economy. To this end, the PA highlights the construction of the ShenzhenHong Kong InnoTech Cooperation Zone, supported by the central government, featuring a campus in Shenzhen and another at the Lo Ma Chau Bend. The SAR government plans to spend HK billion on a fiveyear Global STEM Professorship Scheme to attract overseas talents to local universities. It would be a breakthrough in talent sourcing. Yet another important factor in restoring residents confidence is more space for career development, which calls for measures to facilitate Hong Kong residents career moves in the GuangdongHong KongMacao Greater Bay Area. The PA lists several measures in this respect, such as allowing hospitals in GBA cities run by Hong Kongbased medical facilities to use drugs and equipment registered in Hong Kong allowing more Hong Kongregistered vehicles to cross the Hong KongZhuhaiMacao Bridge and implementing crossboundary wealth management arrangements. Those measures would facilitate Hong Kong residents life and work in the GBA onehour travel circle on the mainland. It will be complemented by a GBA Youth Employment Scheme, which will help Hong Kong youths find career opportunities in mainland GBA cities, covering such sectors as science and technology and finance. The SAR government will subsidize their salaries in the GBA ranging from HK,, a month. The scheme should bring more job opportunities to youths having a hard time finding employment in Hong Kong and encourage others to pursue career development in the GBA.Last but not least, the PA emphasizes it is absolutely crucial to uphold the one country, two systems principle on matters concerning the relationship between the HKSAR and central government the chief executive is accountable to the HKSAR as well as the central authorities and dutybound by the Basic Law to a faithful execution of one country, two systems. The key to this objective is maintaining the proper functioning of the constitutional order, which is the foundation of socioeconomic development. Without proper political order it would be extremely difficult to achieve speedy economic recovery and development goals. No crisis is insurmountable for Hong Kong as long as the SAR government is joined by the public as a whole in handling all challenges. What the city needs most right now is collective will and determination to overcome any obstacle in its way. Looking at how communities around the world have done in fighting the pandemic, we can say the more united they are the better their results tend to be. The PA is just a call to action, which has to be followed by joint efforts from all stakeholders in rebuilding the city.
