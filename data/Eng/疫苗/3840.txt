Austin, in his remarks later, said that as the leader of the Pentagon, his priority will always be the men and women, military and civilian, who make up the department, and their families. The retired general will be tasked with implementing the Biden administrations military and defense priorities, while playing a role in executing the logistics associated with COVID vaccine distribution, according to the presidentelects team.
