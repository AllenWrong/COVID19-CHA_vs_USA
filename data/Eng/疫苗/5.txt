2021-11-24 00:00
China will play a proactive role in international rulemaking concerning intellectual property rights and help domestic businesses better protect their IPR as they go global, according to a recent policy document. The fiveyear plan on the protection and use of IPR recently issued by the State Council, Chinas Cabinet, lays out proposals for actively participating in shaping international IPR regulations pertaining to genetic resources, traditional knowledge, folk art and intangible cultural heritage, as well as emerging areas and new sectors. Cooperation with Belt and Road Initiative member regions over IPR alignment will be stepped up with the development of the Digital Silk Road, and China will also move forward with international collaboration over IPR information and data resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
