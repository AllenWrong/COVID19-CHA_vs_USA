The proposal came on the heels of an agreement with the vaccine manufacturer, but it remains to be approved by the European Union EU member states in the joint Steering Board, the executive arm of the EU said in a statement. The accelerated ten million vaccine doses would be drawn forward from the  million doses ordered by the EU in its second contract with PfizerBioNTech. This delivery was originally scheduled for the third and fourth quarters of this year. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stressed that the next quarter is critical for the rollout of vaccination strategies in the EU member states. This accelerated delivery will bring the total supply of PfizerBioNTechs vaccines to the EU to over  million doses in the next quarter. This is very good news. It gives member states room to maneuver and possibly fill gaps in deliveries, von der Leyen added. The European Commission expects  million COVID vaccine doses to be delivered per month, or a grand total of  million doses for the second quarter. In addition to the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, the jabs produced by Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen have also received conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency EMA. All these are now in the EUs vaccines portfolio. Meanwhile, France Germany, Italy, Spain, Slovenia, Cyprus and Portugal on Monday joined the growing number of countries that have suspended the use of AstraZenecas COVID vaccine over blood clot concerns. The World Health Organization WHO said on Monday that it was still conducting its safety review of the AstraZeneca vaccine, while the EMA is expected to make its decision soon. The European Commission aims to vaccinate  percent of the EUs adult population by this summer.
