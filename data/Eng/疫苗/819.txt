PhotoXinhua    Chinaproduced inactivated COVID vaccines can provide protection from pneumonia and severe illness caused by the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus, a report from the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed. The report, published on China CDC Weekly online on Friday, said vaccine effectiveness was  percent for the prevention of Delta variantrelated mild symptoms,  percent for the prevention of common symptoms with lung lesion, and  percent against severe illness, among individuals aged  and older  days after the second dose. Partial vaccination, in contrast, showed little effectiveness, while unvaccinated close contacts had  severe or critical cases, it said. It added the results are consistent with the Phase III efficacy clinical trials against the original SARSCoV prototype. The Delta variant caused an outbreak in South Chinas Guangdong province in May and June. The Guangdong CDC determined the vaccination status of these close contacts and which of the close contacts became infected, allowing an estimate of the effectiveness of the vaccines used in Guangdong against COVID caused by the Delta variant. It said the study provides some assurance to the global scientific community that the vaccines hold up against the Delta variant. It also reinforces that it takes two doses of the inactivated vaccines to protect.
