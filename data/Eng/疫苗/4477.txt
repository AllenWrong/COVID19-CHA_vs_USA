ATHENSGreece managed to effectively address the first wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic, despite the faltering in the national health system after a decade of a financial crisis, by focusing on prevention rather than treatment, Greek Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias told a forum in Athens last week.As early as January, authorities had drafted a list of COVID referral hospitals nationwide and personnel at medical centers and airports had been trained to deal with cases, before the first infection was diagnosed in the country on Feb , while measures were implemented and no delay to contain the virus, he said.The pandemic underscores how significant prevention is, and prevention is key in both ancient Greek and Chinese traditional medicine, Greek experts said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
