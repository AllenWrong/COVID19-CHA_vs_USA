German President FrankWalter Steinmeier        American people wait in line to ask for food aid on May , . GUO KEXINHUA    In , the COVID pandemic wreaked havoc around the world, posing a major threat to human security. The virus respects no borders, nor does the epidemic distinguish between races. To defeat the epidemic requires mutual help, solidarity and cooperation among all countries. However, the United States, which has always considered itself an exception and superior, saw its own epidemic situation go out of control, accompanied by political disorder, interethnic conflicts, and social division. It further added to the human rights violations in the country, the socalled city upon a hill and beacon of democracy.  The epidemic went out of control and turned into a human tragedy due to the governments reckless response. By the end of February , the United States, home to less than  percent of the worlds population, accounted for more than a quarter of the worlds confirmed COVID cases and nearly onefifth of the global deaths from the disease. More than , Americans lost their lives due to the virus.  Disorder in American democratic institutions led to political chaos, further tearing the fabric of society apart. Moneytainted politics distorted and suppressed public opinion, turning elections into a oneman show of the wealthy class and peoples confidence in the American democratic system dropped to the lowest level in  years. Amid increasing political polarization, hate politics evolved into a national plague, and the Capitol was stormed in postelection riots.  Ethnic minority groups suffered systematic racial discrimination and were in a difficult situation. People of color made up about onethird of all minors under the age of  in the United States but twothirds of all of the countrys imprisoned minors. African Americans are three times as likely as whites to be infected with the coronavirus, twice as likely to die from COVID, and three times as likely to be killed by the police. One in four young Asian Americans has been the target of racial bullying.  Gun trade and shooting incidents hit a record high, and peoples confidence in social order waned. Americans bought  million guns in  against the background of an outofcontrol epidemic, accompanied by racial justice protests and electionrelated conflicts, a surge of  percent compared with . Firsttime gun buyers exceeded  million. More than , people were killed in shooting incidents across the United States in the year, an average of more than  a day, and there were  mass shootings nationwide, an average of more than . a day.  George Floyd, an African American, died after being brutally kneeled on his neck by a white police officer, sparking a national outcry. Widespread protests for racial justice erupted in  states. The U.S. government suppressed demonstrators by force, and more than , people were arrested. A large number of journalists were attacked and arrested for no reason.  The gap between the rich and the poor widened, with the people at the bottom of society living in misery. The epidemic led to mass unemployment. Tens of millions of people lost health insurance coverage. One in six Americans and one in four American children were at risk of hunger. Vulnerable groups became the biggest victims of the governments reckless response to the epidemic. The U.S. government, instead of introspecting on its own terrible human rights record, kept making irresponsible remarks on the human rights situation in other countries, exposing its double standards and hypocrisy on human rights. Standing at a new crossroads, mankind is faced with new, grave challenges. It is hoped that the U.S. side will show humility and compassion for the suffering of its own people, drop hypocrisy, bullying, Big Stick and double standards, and work with the international community to build a community with a shared future for humanity.
