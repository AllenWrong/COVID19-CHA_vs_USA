Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Commission, said provincial governments have put vaccination as the top priority in epidemic prevention and control efforts. The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council has set up a working group on vaccination coordination and local authorities have set up enough inoculation centers equipped with sufficient staff and equipment, he said at a news conference. China also has established a digital tracing platform for all vaccines to make sure the whole process of vaccination is traceable, Li said. The inoculation centers are also equipped with firstaid personnel and ambulances to deal with possible side effects from vaccination, he said.
