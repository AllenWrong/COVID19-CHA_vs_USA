The socalled report on the origins of COVID compiled by the US intelligence community recently politicizes, stigmatizes, and singularizes COVID origins, Juan Carlos Marsan Aguilera, deputy head of the International Relations Department of the PCC Central Committee, was quoted as saying. During an online meeting of the Sao Paulo Forum FSP held Thursday, the official said, the US intention to blame the Peoples Republic of China for the origins of the virus is another attempt by the North American nation to manipulate the COVID crisis to benefit their political interests. He said the US report lacks scientific evidence and clarity, adding the joint report on origins tracing done by the World Health Organization and Chinese scientists in early  has laid out scientific, professional and authorized conclusions. A declaration issued on Thursday after the meeting highlighted Chinas efforts to provide vaccines to various countries, including Latin America, as an important contribution to global cooperation in the fight against pandemics. The virus knows no borders or nations. Only with the solidarity of the entire international community can we be victorious against the virus, the declaration said. The union of all countries, respecting international solidarity and cooperation, is fundamental at this time to be victorious in the face of the pandemic and overcome this difficult moment in our history, laying the foundations for a better future for all humanity, it added.
