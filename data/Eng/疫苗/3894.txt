CDC research identifies coronavirus in blood donated as early as midDecember last year                     While some scientists are racing against time to find vaccines for COVID, others are looking into the origin of the novel coronavirus.  In recent months, researchers in countries such as the United States, Italy and France have suggested that COVID infections may have gone unnoticed long before December , based on analysis of wastewater or blood samples.  Researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found coronavirus infections in  of , blood donations collected from residents in nine states across the country as early as midDecember last year.  Their study was published on Monday on the website of the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.  The new study provides a perspective on the mysterious origin of the coronavirus, as other scientific papers also indicated that the virus emerged in France in late December and in Italy even earlieraround the time or before pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in China on Dec .  The World Health Organization said it received Chinas official report on the clusters of cases on Jan .  As of Tuesday, the world has recorded at least . million confirmed infection cases, which claimed more than . million lives, including nearly , in the US, according to Reuters.  The specimens for the US study, gathered by the American Red Cross between Dec , , and Jan ,, were sent to the US CDC for retrospective testing to see if any had antibodies to SARSCoV, the respiratory virus that causes COVID.  As a result, the CDC scientists found antiSARSCoV antibodies in  samples from the states of California, Oregon and Washington, collected as early as Dec  to . The CDC scientists said their presence indicates that isolated infections may have occurred in the western part of the US in midDecember last year.  The state of Washington was where the first patient in the United States was given a diagnosis of infection with the virus by the CDC on Jan . The state reported at least , confirmed cases as of Tuesday, with more than , deaths.  Antibodies also were found in  samples collected from Massachusetts, Michigan, Wisconsin or Iowa, and Connecticut or Rhode Island.  The Wall Street Journal said the findings significantly strengthen evidence suggesting the virus was spreading around the world well before public health authorities and researchers became aware, upending initial thinking about how early and quickly it emerged.  Researchers found the virus, for example, in a retrospective analysis of a specimen from a patient who was hospitalized in France on Dec , , according to the Wall Street Journal.  That was weeks before the first infections were confirmed in France on Jan , .  In Italy, where the first COVID patient was reported on Feb , researchers have found evidence that the virus may have been spreading since September .  The Italian researchers findings, published by the National Cancer Institutes scientific magazine Tumori Journal on Nov , show that . percent of  healthy volunteers participating in a lung cancer screening trial between September  and March of this year had developed coronavirus antibodies.  WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the agency is committed to doing everything it can to find the origins of the novel coronavirus, as it can help the world prevent future outbreaks, but he urged countries not to politicize the hunt.  What has been a barrier and trying to derail us from what we have been doing scientifically was the politicization of the study of the origin of the virus from some quarters, Tedros said at a daily briefing in Geneva on Monday.  An international team of experts will start the study from Wuhan to know what happened there, and then based on the findings we have there, to explore if there are other avenues that we have to explore, the WHO chief said.  The WHO said the first cases in Wuhan are believed to date from the beginning of December.  But where an epidemic is first detected does not necessarily reflect where it started, the world agency said in a November report.  huanxinzhaochinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
