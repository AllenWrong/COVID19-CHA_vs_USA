PhotoAgencies    WASHINGTON  As the United States continues to push forward its domestic vaccination program, overseas Americans who are required to pay US taxes are feeling left behind by their own government, The Washington Post reported Monday. Citing official figures, the report said that an estimated  million Americans now live outside the United States, and in recent weeks, a growing chorus has argued that they should therefore be entitled to receive USapproved coronavirus vaccines. According to the report, unlike expatriates from most other countries, American expats are required to pay US taxes, but their request to have a vaccine has been denied by the White House. We have not historically provided private health care for Americans living overseas, so that remains our policy, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was quoted as saying in the report.
