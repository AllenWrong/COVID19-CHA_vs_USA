PhotoAgencies    NEW YORK  Western countries have stockpiled large quantities of vaccines against COVID, creating stark inequity between rich countries and poor countries, U.S. media has reported. By partnering with drug companies, Western leaders bought their way to the front of the line, said The New York Times on Monday, adding that they ignored explicit calls from the World Health Organization to include contract language that would have guaranteed doses for poor countries. Residents of wealthy and middleincome countries have received about  percent of the nearly  million vaccines delivered so far, it noted.
