The plan contains direct payments of , dollars per person for working families, but Democrats have agreed to limit the number of people who can get the stimulus checks to win the support of moderate Democrats, which prompted backlash from progressives.The Houseapproved bill also includes a provision to raise the federal minimum wage to  dollars, which would face tough tests in the  split Senate, where parliamentarians have ruled that the wage increase violates the budget reconciliation process and cannot be included.In early February, Democrats moved to pass a procedural step in both chambers, allowing them to push through the big relief bill in Congress without Republican support, a move criticized by Republicans as a partisan process.
