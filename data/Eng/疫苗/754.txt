GUANGZHOUA recombinant COVID fusion protein vaccine developed and manufactured in China has been approved for latestage clinical trials in the Philippines.  The V vaccine was developed by the Institute of Biophysics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Livzon Pharmaceutical Group in Guangdong province.  V is a fusion recombinant protein vaccine with the receptorbinding domain as the antigen, which is the most important part of the virus spike protein binding with human cellular ACE receptors. The binding process grants the virus access to the hosts cells and leads to infection.  The Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines has approved the latestage trial of V to evaluate its safety and efficacy. The trial has started recruiting participants in adults in the country, with the first participant enrolled on Wednesday and inoculated with the first dose.  Hu Zhenxiang, vicepresident of Livzon, told Xinhua News Agency that the early and midstage trials of V had produced satisfactory results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
