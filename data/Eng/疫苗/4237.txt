Zhong, recipient of the Medal of the Republic, made the remarks via video link at the th China Bioindustry Convention that was held in Wuhan, capital of Central Chinas Hubei province, China Youth Daily reported. China has been working with over  countries on vaccine development and has gained approval from countries such as Russia and Brazil to carry out phase  trials in the countries, Zhong said, and four vaccines have entered international phase  trials. Zhong also noted that COVID epidemic may continue or even worsen this winter and next spring. Once infection is detected in an area, joint prevention and control measures in communities, nucleic acid testing for all community residents and quarantine for asymptomatic cases are effective measures to contain the spread, he said. In particular, asymptomatic cases must be placed strictly under quarantine, as they are highly contagious during the five days before and after they show symptoms, Zhong noted.
