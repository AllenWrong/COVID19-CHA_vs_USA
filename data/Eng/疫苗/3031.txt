Access to vaccines still an issue

Solidarity in the global endeavor against the COVID pandemic has so far proved to be meaningless as far as the fair distribution of vaccines is concerned. Since the number of doses administered in  developed countries accounts for  percent of the worlds total and inoculation has not even started in  countries, the prospect of effectively containing the spread of the novel coronavirus worldwide is not as bright as it should be.That explains why World Health Organization DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pleaded with rich countries on Monday to check before ordering additional vaccine shots for themselves whether that undermines efforts to get vaccine shots for poor countries.Although the leaders of the G industrial countries said their countries have committed a collective . billion to COVAX, the WHO head said on Monday that even if you have the money, if you cannot use the money to buy vaccines, having the money does not mean anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
