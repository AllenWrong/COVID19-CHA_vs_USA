Doubts raised over whether US took timely actions against COVID                     As President Donald Trump said the United States started to develop a candidate for the first COVID vaccine on Jan , experts questioned the administrations handling of the crisis even though it had early knowledge of the impending pandemic.  At a news briefing on Friday, Trump said US scientists could develop a COVID vaccine by the end of this year and that the first actions in the US on a vaccine began on Jan .  So, January th. Most people never even heard what was going on January th. And we were out there trying to develop a vaccine, not even knowing what we were up against.  The date has aroused skepticism among experts because it was not until more than two months later, on March , that Trump declared the novel coronavirus pandemic to be a national emergency. The next day, his government issued guidelines calling on the public to avoid social gatherings of more than  people and to limit discretionary travel in an effort to contain the virus. The guidelines were to be in place for  days.  Long Xingchun, an adjunct senior fellow at Beijing Foreign Studies Universitys Academy of Regional and Global Governance, said Trumps remarks cast doubt on whether US politicians had paid enough attention to the virus and whether the antiepidemic measures the administration had adopted were timely.  China had issued a clear and detailed timeline of its handling of the outbreak, Long said.  China notified the World Health Organization of the genetic sequence of the virus on Jan . According to Trumps remarks, health experts in the US began work on the vaccine in the early phase, yet some US politicians response to the virus were still disappointing.  Given that the US government has claimed it has the worlds most developed medical systems and best scientific research, it should rethink its policy responses when a public health emergency such as COVID arises, said Jia Jinjing, assistant dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China in Beijing.  To cope with such crises, governments need quick responses and flexible policy adjustment based on peoples needs. US politicians need to rethink whether their public health system can cope with such a crisis.  It took only  days for the number of US COVID cases in the US to grow from one to ,, and only eight days for the number to surpass , from March  to March , according to the Johns Hopkins University.  A week later, on March , the number of confirmed cases in the US had surpassed ,, and confirmed cases in the country now exceed ,,. The number of reported deaths was nearing , on Sunday, both figures being the worst in the world.  Media reports said two residents of Snohomish county, Washington, had tested positive for antibodies against the novel coronavirus after developing symptoms similar to COVID in December, several weeks before the countrys first confirmed case in midJanuary.  One of the residents reportedly developed symptoms, including dry cough, fever and body aches, shortly after Christmas, and improved after seeking medical help. The patient recently learned from her family doctor that her blood test had shown positive for novel coronavirus antibodies, The Seattle Times reported.  Antibody test cannot tell when the patient was exposed to the virus, but the two patients test results, combined with their symptoms in December, appeared to meet the definition of COVID provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  They are being considered probable, Heather Thomas, a Snohomish Health District spokeswoman, said in an email to The Seattle Times on Thursday, adding that the two patients are not in the case counts from January  and later.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the directorgeneral of the WHO, has said he is unsure whether the US will join an initiative for equal access to drugs and vaccines for COVID.  He made the remarks in a virtual media conference from Geneva when he was joined by Costa Ricas President Carlos Alvarado Quesada and Chiles President Sebastian Pinera in a prelaunch of a new worldwide access initiative for COVID health technologies, including vaccines, medicines and other solutions.  Relations between the WHO and the US have soured after Trump accused the global health body of mismanaging the pandemic and for being Chinacentric. Trump has also ordered US funding to the WHO to be halted. The moves have been widely viewed as a way of deflecting attention from the US governments poor handling of the pandemic at home.
