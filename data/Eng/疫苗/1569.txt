China, US expected to drive the rebound, with Beijings efforts lauded as blueprint for others                     China, along with advanced economies led by the United States, will be the backbone of the worlds postpandemic rebound, with the global economy expected to improve more quickly than previously forecast, experts said.  Euromonitor International, a Londonbased market research company, upgraded its global economic growth forecast earlier this month to . percent for this year, an upward revision of . percentage point from its projection in the first quarter of . It cited China and the US as two major driving forces.  Christopher Bovis, a professor of international business law at the University of Hull in England, said, The postpandemic recovery will be driven by the US and China, and their respective economies will fuel demand and supply, respectively.  He believes China will be a major part of the global plan for postpandemic recovery. Its staggering economic growth during the first quarter of  is a demonstration of globalization postpandemic as the blueprint to recovery.  Chinas economy grew by an unprecedented . percent yearonyear in the first quarter of this year, compared with . percent in the fourth quarter of last year, according to the countrys National Bureau of Statistics.  Chris Rudd, deputy vicechancellor and head of the Singapore campus of Australias James Cook University, said, Chinas decisive response to COVID enabled it to enter economic recovery even as advanced economies continued to nosedive, and we look enviously at the levels of normality which its citizens enjoy.  The Euromonitor International report adjusted Chinas real GDP growth to . percent in , compared with  percent in its January projection.  Mario Cavolo, a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijingbased think tank, said, China will be on track or even better with its actual growth.  He said the West seems to be incapable of understanding how steady and stable the domestic market is here in China, from household consumption all the way up the scale to the highest levels of industry, where its largest companies are exercising discipline and foresight. My view of China has always been among the most bullish, and I have yet to be wrong.  The findings from Euromonitor International economists suggested that high vaccination rates in rich countries are likely to lead to a strong recovery, supported by rising consumer confidence, fiscal stimulus and high accumulated savings.  It added that the strong recovery outlook for advanced economies is mainly driven by the US, due to its relatively fast vaccine rollout and the strong fiscal stimulus measures deployed by US President Joe Biden.  Gulnur Muradoglu, a professor of finance at Queen Mary University of London, said, The speed of recovery from the COVID crisis depends on the policy response from governments to vaccination rates.  If governments respond to increasing vaccination by removing shutdowns faster than expected, then the growth rates can be higher. If policy response is slow to increasing vaccination rates with concerns about variants of the virus, then I would expect economic recovery to be slower, she added.  Muradoglu said that rebounds following economic crises normally come with faster growth rates, though whether the whole world is likely to begin emerging from the pandemic in the second half of this year remains a question.  Bovis, the University of Hull professor, said Rich countries are likely to experience a faster rebound because they will reach herd immunity first. In addition, the timing of achieving herd immunity from COVID and the proportion of population vaccinated will be also factors that will play a key role in shaping the forecast demand from advanced economies.  Some experts said the immediate postpandemic economic readings should be viewed with caution.  David Miles, a professor of financial economics at Imperial College Business School in London, said The shortterm high growth in many developed economies this year is a partial bounceback from very depressed activity. It is a shortterm bounce that tells us little about next year and beyond. It also tells us little about the longerterm harm done by the pandemic.  Rudd, of James Cook University, said increased investment combined with the recovery of consumption in many regions will certainly drive greater economic success, but detailed forecasting remains a matter of conjecture in a time when uncertainty remains.  wangmingjiemail.chinadailyuk.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
