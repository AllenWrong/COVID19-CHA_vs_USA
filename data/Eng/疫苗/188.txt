She also encouraged parents with questions to talk to their pediatrician, school nurse or local pharmacist to learn more about the vaccine and the importance of getting their children vaccinated. US President Joe Biden described the authorization as a turning point in the battle against COVID, saying in a statement that the program will ramp up over the coming days, and fully up and running during the week of Nov. . The decision came after an independent panel of experts on the CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices had unanimously recommended the shots for children in a  vote.
