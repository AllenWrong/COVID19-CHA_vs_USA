Residents walk on wild side amid pandemic woes

One of the most symbolic aspects of the COVID pandemic that has dominated  is the grounding of the worlds airlines. Like the Icarus of Greek mythology who used manmade wings only to fly too close to the sun and fall into the sea and drown, this year the selfconfidence of st century society has been given the harshest of reality checks by the forces of nature. Sealed borders mean people who previously took globetrotting for granted have found themselves grounded, confined and forced to contemplate their immediate surroundings, maybe for the first time. But one positive aspect has been a renewed appreciation of nature and its soothing properties, according to latest observations in Britain. Melissa Harrison, a nature diarist for The Times newspaper, noted the sights, sounds and smells of the English countryside. Throughout the antipandemic lockdown, she recorded a weekly podcast, The Stubborn Light of Things, which is also the name of a book of her collected writings. In the podcast, she took listeners through the patterns of seasonal change, mixing her observations with music and poetry, for an experience which proved popular among people worldwide seeking a mental escape from the lockdown. Where I live, I could walk in the countryside as much as I wanted every day, and other people didnt have that, so I decided to share my good luck with them, Harrison said. The podcast avoided confronting environmental issues because people need to love nature before they can address such topics, she said. I spent four months living alone when I was doing this, and maybe I treated it as talking to a friend who wasnt there, she said. People, some in a similar situation, really responded to that. The project was not a commercial venture and helping people develop a love for nature was its own reward, she said. I would never have chosen for it to happen this way, because of the damage its done, but the way the pandemic has forced people to slow down and discover the simple joys of the world around them is very moving, Harrison said. What it has highlighted, she said, is not so much the positivity of connecting with nature, but the negativity caused by isolation from it. Humans dont do well away from nature, she said. For millennia we evolved in nature, our bodies and brains developed in connection to it, not connected to electric lights and air conditioning. Our norm is to be outside. Deprivation from this has a negative effect. People have also been looking for ways to engage more with nature physically, as well as mentally. Kristine Boudreau is manager of the Thames Water Hogsmill Nature Reserve in suburban southwest London. Its  hectares form a designated site of important nature conservation that hosts large numbers of birds, badgers, hedgehogs, butterflies and protected species of newt and bats. Since the start of the year, Boudreau said, interest in volunteering and membership has risen by more than  percent. There are definitely more people wanting to get involved in our activities now, sometimes too many, she said. Peoples working life is stressful and they find getting out in nature a good remedy. We even have one volunteer who is recovering from cancer, and realized he wasnt utilizing nature as much as he should, so now he gets out whenever he can and feels a lot better for it. The restrictions of COVID have made a difference to peoples appreciation of their surroundings, she said. Its not just here, all the Thames Water reserves have experienced increased interest, and I think it will last, she said. People have taken nature for granted and not realized its benefits. COVID has made them take a step back, evaluate their lives and realize how getting out in nature is part of a healthier life. The recent breakthroughs in COVID vaccine development offer a ray of hope that could lead to the virus becoming far less of a threat to everyday life, as humanity reemerges to a new normality, according to the observers. In times of crisis, theres always a collective outreach for nature, Harrison said. Over the years, our relationship with nature has become so unhealthy and exploitative. This virus is part of nature, so we need to listen to what its telling us. Im really hopeful this experience will change how people think about natureI cant see how it wont. julianmail.chinadailyuk.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
