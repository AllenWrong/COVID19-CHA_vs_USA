PhotoIC    WASHINGTON  Imported frozen food may play a role in the emergency of SARSCoV in China, said a recent research conducted by British and Chinese scientists and published in US magazine Science. The researchers reviewed the SARSassociated coronavirus and discussed possible animal origin of the novel coronavirus, reaching the conclusion that animaltohuman transmission associated with infected live animals is the most likely cause of the COVID pandemic, according to the study report titled The animal origin of SARSCoV. However, the massive scale of coldchain supply ... suggests that frozen susceptibleanimal carcasses, either for human or animal consumption, should not be discounted as playing a role in the emergency of SARSCoV, read the report published in late August. The report noted that the outbreak of the African swine fever virus, which had led to a severe shortage of pork products in China in , increased wildlifeanimal contacts, since China imported other meat such as poultry, beef and fish products from international markets in response to the shortfall. The resulting increased trade of susceptible farmed animals and wildlife could have brought humans into more frequent contact with meat products and animals infected with zoonotic pathogens, including SARSrCoVs, it said, pointing to reports of Chinese patients who had contact with imported frozen foods, and of SARSCoV apparently identified from frozen food, packaging, and storage surfaces. The scientists also called for international antivirus cooperation, saying humanity musk work together beyond country borders to amplify surveillance for coronavirus at the humananimal interface to minimize the threat of both established and evolving variants evading vaccines and to stop future spillover events.
