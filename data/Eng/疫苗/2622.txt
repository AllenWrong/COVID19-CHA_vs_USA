2021-03-30 00:00
Shortly after the Chinese governments announcement that it had provided over  million doses of locally developed COVID vaccines to foreign countries, the national joint COVID containment mechanism declared that vaccination at home had also surpassed  million doses on Saturday. More important, the authorities are markedly accelerating massive free inoculation programs at home, and boosting the capacity to meet overseas demand, with Chinese vaccines having proved safe and effective. As new mutations and variants of the novel coronavirus continue to emerge, and countries around the world race against time to speed up their vaccination programs and compete for proper vaccine supplies, China has a significant role to play in the global campaign against the pandemic. As the first country to identify the virus, China was also among the first to start vaccine RD. That, combined with the countrys mobilization mechanisms and capabilities, has enabled the country to simultaneously work on many vaccine possibilities following multiple technical routes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
