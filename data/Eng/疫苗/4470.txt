According to the report, Dr Tony Wang and colleagues at the US Food and Drug Administrations vectorborne viral diseases laboratory in Maryland gave raTG, the closest known relative to SARSCoV, a spike similar to that of SarsCoV. Spikes are proteins that bind the virus to a host cell. The most striking finding of this study is that insertion of PRRA into the raTG spike protein altered the ability of relevant pseudovirus to utilize ACE of three species to gain entry, the researchers said in their paper published as a preprint on the website BioRxiv. Structural and biochemical studies have suggested that SARSCoV may have been well adapted in human before the outbreak in Wuhan, China, they added in the paper. The new study may cast doubt on a theory that the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory, the South China Morning Post reported.
