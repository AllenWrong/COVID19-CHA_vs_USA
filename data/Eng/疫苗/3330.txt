Wedding planners and their clients found innovative ways of working round the challenges of hosting nuptials in the time of a pandemic. Joyce Yip reports.                                  When Kevin Cureau proposed to Stephanie Ip in late , they had imagined the celebrations stretching from Hong Kong to Macon, France. Instead, they found themselves signing a register at the Hong Kong City Hall in March . The reception was held more than halfayear later, after two postponements  downsized from the intended pax sitdown dinner at the  Heritage courtyard to a cocktail party split into three sessions in keeping with the local governments ruling to limit the number of guests to  people at a time. Close family arrived at  pm, work friends at  pm and others from  pm onward. Cureau says although there werent any restrictions on international travel in February, both local guests and his immediate family in France were wary about attending a wedding in Hong Kong. So we just pushed it back to endMay, says Cureau. When the situation didnt improve later, it was postponed again, to November. Since  Heritage and their gownrental vendor refused to refund their deposits, canceling the wedding wasnt an option. So as to not let the money spent on rentals go to waste, Ip went for two costume changes during the evening of her reception, which further shortened the rationed time she was allowed with each group of guests. Making the experience as comfortable as possible for the attendees was priority. A sitdown reception wasnt an option, says Ip. We wanted a setting where they could move around and come or leave whenever they wanted. If the hotel could cancel, I would wait until COVID was over and wed just do something in France. But given the situation, I just wanted to get it over and done with, she adds. Luc Bollen, area director of Park Lane Hotels International and general manager of The Park Lane Hong Kong, a Pullman Hotel, says this new trend of split receptions is catching on. Its not uncommon to see a ninemonth separation between the signing ceremony andor an intimate, traditional family lunch or a big wedding party later on, he says, adding that his hotel saw a  percent drop in wedding revenue last year. Nearly half of the scheduled weddings were postponed. Weddings still went on in March and April May and June were when everyone started postponing but later in the year, people just basically said were going to do this one way or another, especially if theyd chosen auspicious dates. Thats when we had to really think out of the box to come up with alternatives, Bollen says. Creative solutions For Nicole Froelich, wedding planner and founder of Nicole Please, such adjustments ranged from redesigning the entire color scheme to finding smaller venues to cater to fewer guests. On average, there are  vendors per wedding Emotions aside, I come in as a neutral person to understand their priorities, namely which vendor is the most important? If the photographer cant make it on the new date, are we still going ahead? says Froelich. For a lot of couples, the first reschedule was really emotional, but once you show them that there are creative solutions out there, they become more okay with the situation. For example, a smaller guest list means they have money for a second dress or a datechange could actually come with better packages, she points out. In March , Froelich launched a rescheduling service for nonclients, and in September, joined hands with Exclusive Venue to host weddings at private villas and homes, which allowed us to be more flexible while still following the restrictions. While accommodating pandemicspecific demands has not been the easiest of tasks, her company has managed to meet most of them. Froelich remembers having to plan for installing a COVID testing station at the entrance to a wedding reception in the recent past as the client wanted to make sure the venue was virus free. Adapting to the new normal has also meant a change in the scope of her job. Since the pandemic began, Froelich, who used to be, primarily, a destinationwedding planner, has received almost  local weddingrelated enquiries. She notes couples intending to tie the knot have become more flexible in the time of fluctuating socialdistancing regulations. The pandemic, by default, has helped speed up the decisionmaking process. Many vendors appreciate these are hard times and dont mind waiving rescheduling fees to be able to survive in a competitive market. Froelich says there is a trend of people wanting their wedding to be organized within a few days of their first meeting with a marriage planner. Theyre making gut decisions much faster because they dont have time to waste, and theres less pressure from family members who have become more understanding of the couples situation. Virtual site visits COVID has led to the emergence of VR technologies that help couples with planning wedding banquets. Launched in , Peter Leungs Bespoke Production has been turning event spaces, restaurants and hotel rooms into immersive degree VR tours that could be viewed on smart devices via an URL. His clients include Four Seasons Hong Kong, Sino Hotels, ShangriLa Group, Mandarin Oriental group and Langham Hospitality Group. Unlike older versions of virtual tours, Leungs product comes with highdefinition D models. The experience of a virtual walkthrough of the venues is as close to its real life counterpart as it could get. The obvious benefit of Bespoke Production products is that clients can conduct multiple sitevisits from the comfort of their COVIDfree homes. Leung says its a service especially attractive to young couples who want all the information before reaching out to the venue. Coming wedding boom? Back at The Park Lane Hong Kong, weddings scheduled for  are  to  percent smaller in size compared to those held prepandemic. Until the vaccine is rolled out, Bollen says he must remain flexible. With the exception of auspicious dates, our lead time is getting shorter as couples are less eager to put down deposits and make contractual agreements. In general, we all had the feeling we were working much harder than before, Bollen says. But we think  might be a good year. Froelich, too, remains hopeful. She expects to see double the number of weddings, with even more impressive parties, bigger screens for virtual attendance and more outdoor receptions. I hope one day there will be a vaccine tracker so we can do a better seating arrangement, she says. Everything always works out in the end. All the couples Ive dealt with are very understanding and flexible. Two months have gone by since the November wedding of the CureauIp couple. Looking back, they seem glad about going ahead with their triple cocktail reception. I do have one regret though a proper walk down the aisle, says Ip. Although thats not something we planned for Hong Kong, now we dont know whether well be doing anything in France any more. Also Id have liked it if my close friends from the United States had come, she adds. But this is the situation were in.        Kevin Cureau and Stephanie Yip, who tied the knot in November , received their guests in three installments during the same evening, in keeping with government regulations on social gatherings.
