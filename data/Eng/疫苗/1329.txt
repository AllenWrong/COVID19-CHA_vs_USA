Enjoying a sense of ease getting my vaccination

On the last Friday in May, I got in a cab for the ride to Beijing United Family Hospital on Jiangtai Road. Through the haze of the morning sun, the cab weaved in and out of the rush hour traffic. We eventually got off the highway and turned toward my destination. Small restaurants lined the street, reminding me of st Avenue in New York City. Hospitals festoon the road in New York and the popup cafes serve the medical workers there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
