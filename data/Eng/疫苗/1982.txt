Chinese doses play vital role around world

WHO decision to give Sinopharm vaccine emergency use green light eases situation                    Health experts say that an increased global reliance on Chinese COVID vaccines cannot come soon enough, as other vaccines contend with delays in development and exportation.Vaccines from Chinese pharmaceutical companies Sinopharm and Sinovac are about to play an increasingly vital role in the developing world, now that AstraZeneca exports from India have halted and United States biotechnology company Novavax has indicated that it is once again delaying regulatory submissions for approval of its vaccine.Last week the World Health Organization listed the Sinopharm vaccine for emergency use, giving it the green light to be rolled out globally under the COVAX program, which distributes vaccines to developing nations.Its a very significant development, because with COVAX, they were very reliant in the first quarter of this year on the AstraZeneca vaccine, Caroline Casey, lead COVID analyst at science analytics company Airfinity, told China Daily. And about  percent of that supply in the first half of this year was meant to come from India, which has currently got an export ban because of the situation there where they need to reserve as many vaccines as they can to protect their own population. So that leaves quite a big hole in COVAXs portfolio.COVAX had hoped to distribute  million COVID vaccines in the first half of this year, but so far just  million doses have been delivered, according to Airfinity. This distribution rate is unlikely to improve anytime soon, now that India has halted exports.COVAX was relying on  percent of its supply being AstraZeneca vaccines, about twothirds of which were supposed to be supplied by India, with the rest coming from South Korea. Pfizer has agreed to supply  percent of, or  million, COVAX vaccines in the first half of this year, though only . million of the Pfizer doses have been delivered to date.The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at ultralow temperatures, and COVAX has only granted approval for distribution of Pfizer in  nations. COVAX rejected several countries applications for that vaccine because they do not have the necessary cold chain infrastructure to distribute the treatments.Casey said COVAX has even held back some AstraZeneca deliveries, over concerns that distribution was unlikely before the vaccines sixmonth expiration period. By comparison, Sinovac shots are thought to stay usable for up to three years.Health authorities said that the inclusion of Sinopharm in the COVAX initiative could have a particular impact on vaccination programs in Africa, where currently over half the countries have vaccinated less than  percent of their populations.The emergency use listing of the Sinopharm COVID vaccine can help speed up vaccine access for Africa, said WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti. This comes at a critical moment for the continent and is an important step forward. It will help ensure our highrisk populations get the protection they need.Emory University infectious disease doctor Boghuma Kabisen Titanji said the WHO approval of the Sinopharm vaccine was also great news for the African nations that decided to distribute the vaccine before the WHO authorization.This boosts confidence in the use of these vaccines, said Titanji. We need all effective and safe vaccines in this fight.Many nations had begun using the Sinopharm vaccine before the WHO announcement, and a flurry of new orders and approvals followed the health bodys authorization. The Maldives approved it for people age  and older, and Sri Lanka confirmed that it will now dig into a stockpile of , Sinopharm doses.Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming announced that , Sinopharm doses will soon arrive in the South Asian nation.Its the latest outcome of ChinaBangladesh antipandemic cooperation, Li told reporters. China is dedicated to international vaccine cooperation.Philippines Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire confirmed that her government is about to approve the Sinopharm vaccine, and Perus Health Minister Oscar Ugarte said his nation has ordered , Sinopharm doses that will be distributed now that they have WHO authorization.Recent data suggest that the Sinovac vaccine is highly effective at preventing severe cases of COVID. The companys chief executive, Yin Weidong, told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that in Chile, the vaccine has provided  percent protection from cases requiring intensive care treatment and  percent protection from hospitalization.Yin also addressed concerns that infection rates have been rising in Chile, which has relied primarily on the Sinovac vaccine. It has been distributed among the older age groups, and total coverage is only at  percent. Most Chileans under age  have been vaccinated, Yin said.In this group the vaccination rate is far from enough, he said.The biggest challenge is in supply and demand, he said.We have provided  million doses to Brazil and Indonesia, and about  million to Turkey, which accounts for about  percent of their population. But that is not enough. The virus is still spreading, he said. We need to expand our supply, which is a really big challenge.To expedite distribution of the vaccine, Yin said, Sinovac has licensed Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil, Malaysia, and Egypt to domestically produce the Sinovac vaccine.angusmail.chinadailyuk.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
