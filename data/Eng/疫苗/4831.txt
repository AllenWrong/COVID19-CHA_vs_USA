Social distancing called absolutely essential

After embracing the scientific terms flattening the curve and social distancing, Americans wonder when life will return to normal. But some experts say the practice of physical distancing may need to remain in place for the next two years.Such measures are absolutely essential, said Jonathan Fielding, a professor at the schools of public health and medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.And its important that we keep everybody compliant with these measures if we dont want things to get worse, Fielding added.Experts say protective measures such as social distancing are the key to flattening the curve of infection so that the total number of COVID cases is spread over a longer term, thereby ensuring that healthcare systems are not overwhelmed.While bracing for a surge of coronavirus cases, the hospital of the University of California San Francisco has kept caseloads low. The hospitals COVID unit with  beds had only  patients, according to an NBC News report on April .UCSF and its doctors took to social media to note that new cases in San Francisco seemed to be flattening as a result of the citys early adoption of social distancing measures.San Francisco declared a public health emergency on Feb . The first US death was announced in Seattle on Feb .Robert Wachter, the chair of the Department of Medicine at UCSF, created a graphic and posted it on Twitter to illustrate how San Francisco and California have handled the pandemic.The city and six surrounding Bay Area counties announced a shelter in place order on March , the first of its kind in the country. Three days later, California ordered all residents to stay at home, the first US state to do so. New York went to shelter at home on March , four days later than California.The graphic indicates a huge difference between the death tolls of the two states. As of April , California had recorded  deaths,  of them in San Francisco, compared with , deaths in New York state, , of which were in New York City.The key to San Franciscos lower number includes big technology companies early action to allow employees to work from home, though the crucial part was that people followed officials guidance, Wachter said.Another early adopter of social distancing measures was Washington state, the early epicenter of COVID in the US. It has not had the same spike as New York.The physical distancing strategy also seemed to work in the hardesthit state of New York, as Governor Andrew Cuomo has said.The increase has slowed down it flattens out for a period of time, he said.However, a recent Google Community Mobility Report analyzing location data from cellphones estimates that physical distancing has reduced national movement to retail and recreational locations by just  percent, with big differences between states that have implemented stayathome orders and those that have not.For example, Arkansas showed just a percent drop in retail and recreational behavior, the lowest rate among all states, while Iowa saw a  percent increase in park visits, the Google report said.Acknowledging the economic burden that prolonged social distancing may impose, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health warned of the potentially catastrophic burden on the healthcare system if distancing measures are not implemented effectively or for long enough.Intermittent distancing may be required into  unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available, the researchers said in a study published in the journal Science on April .liazhuchinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
