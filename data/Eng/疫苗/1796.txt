The international community must come together to empower the current global governance system and increase investment in healthcare systems in a fairer and more equitable manner, to revitalize the pandemichit global economy as soon as possible, according to business and financial leaders.  Jin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, has called on the international community to build global governance into a system with power, authority and teeth, particularly during this unusual time.  When speaking at the International Finance Forum  Spring Meetings on Saturday morning, he said that as lowincome, developing countries tended to be much more vulnerable amid the COVID pandemic, development banks and other development partners need to work faster to help their governments build up strength in their healthcare systems.  We all know that nobody is safe until everybody is safe, he added.  Also addressing the forum but via video, Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, called for faster and fairer vaccine rollouts to safeguard recovery from the shock of the virus.  At least  percent of the global population needs to be vaccinated by the end of this year, and at least  percent by mid, according to an IMF estimate, she said, and such a plan would cost around  billion globally.  COVID is a warning that investing in public health is essential to promoting global financial stability and realizing strong economic growth, argued Jim Yong Kim, former president of the World Bank Group, who also addressed the forum via video.  Focusing on health, education and delivering services to the poor for most of his career, Kim noted that improvements in public health are strongly related to strong economic growth.

He urged global financial institutions to work more proactively with the World Health Organization as well as United Nations agencies, nongovernment organizations and the private sector, to ensure health support becomes more inclusive and to create more access to expertise and resources, including vaccines, to cope with the pandemic.  Through such cooperation, the financial sector is playing an increasingly critical role, particularly as the world needs to grow in a greener, more sustainable manner in the post COVID era, said Zhou Xiaochuan, former governor of the Peoples Bank of China. He urged strengthening the global and regional financial safety net to stabilize the macroeconomy and promoting global trade to support supply chains.  Some developing countries are facing increased debt risks as a result of the pandemic. China has fully implemented the initiative proposed by G members to suspend debt in the poorest countries, or the G Debt Service Suspension Initiative, offering more than . billion in debt reliefthe largest amount of all the G countries, according to Zhou, who delivered a speech at the forum.  Jin, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank president, said the bank has created a new department focusing on supporting and investing in healthcare systems to compensate for the COVID challenge globally.  It the pandemic has told us that no nations can stay safe and sound without sufficient investment in their healthcare system, he said.  The best way to tackle the pandemic impact is to stimulate growth, to invest in human capital and infrastructure for tomorrow, he said.
