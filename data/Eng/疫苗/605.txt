The latest round of COVID outbreak in Fujian province, with a total of  locally transmitted cases having been detected in Putian and neighboring Quanzhou and Xiamen by Monday afternoon since Friday, has once again rung the alarm bell for the countrys pandemic prevention and control work.The approaching MidAutumn Festival, which falls on Sept , and the National Day Golden Week holiday that starts on Oct , make the task even more challenging as the holidays are likely to see a marked increase in the number of people hitting the road.The government now faces the pressing task of making the best use of the peaktravel season to reinvigorate the tourism sector, which has been badly hit by the COVID pandemic, while at the same time ensuring that the novel coronavirus is confined to the few high risk areas in the country, including Putian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
