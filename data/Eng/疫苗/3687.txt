Time to do what it takes to make nonquarantine mainland travel normal again

With the recent good news from the vaccine side, I have reason to believe that the epic battle between mankind and COVID will come to an end soon. But it is also a critical moment for Hong Kong people, as Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuetngor said in her latest Policy Address During almost one year of our fight against the pandemic, Hong Kong has remained vigilant and committed. So by no means should we get too comfortable or even relaxed now after the yearlong battle. The SAR government should spare no effort in mitigating the recent surge of new COVID cases, while we ordinary Hong Kong people must stringently practice social distancing, avoid attending all kinds of parties and going to crowded places. I know, with the holiday season upon us, this can be extremely hard, but we must overcome the difficulties to achieve our common goal to resume travel between Hong Kong and the mainland, so that life can be back to normal and the city will have a brighter future. Right now we basically have two choices. The first is to achieve the target of zero infections the second is that we wait until we get the vaccine. One way or another, we will have to get there by not getting infected with COVID. I will not repeat how we ordinary people need to travel to the mainland for reunions with our family members, whom we havent seen in almost a year. I will only stress here that all the plans mapped out for Hong Kong by the central government and the SAR government are for the citys better integration with other cities in the GuangdongHong KongMacao Greater Bay Area. To this end, free flow of capital, goods and personnel must be maintained within the region. Honestly, I think that people being able to resume travel within the Bay Area without compulsory quarantine requirements should be Hong Kongs top priority. Jonathan Choi Koonshum, a veteran Hong Kong entrepreneur and member of the countrys top political advisory body, told me during an interview that the business community in Hong Kong is eager to travel to the mainland. Ive talk to many entrepreneurs and business owners, they all say that they have to get to the mainland to deal with their businesses, Choi said, adding that with the current compulsory day quarantine requirement in place, once they do travel to the mainland, they may stay there for months before heading back to Hong Kong. A week later, when I tried to approach Dr Choi for another interview, his colleague informed me that he has already traveled back to the mainland. Dennis Ng Wangpun, president of the Chinese Manufacturers Association of Hong Kong, told me during an interview that he and other members of the association were thrilled to learn that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership was signed, and that he believed RCEP will bring a lot of business opportunities, particularly for industries in the Bay Area. Many of our members already have factories or businesses in the Bay Area, Ng said. With the signing and the future implementation of the RCEP, we want to expand our business, particularly the ones targeting Japanese and Korean markets, but we will have to physically go to the mainland cities in the Bay Area. He stressed that members of the Association all want crossboundary travel to resume normally as soon as possible, as they dont want to miss out on any business opportunities. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.                                                                                !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
