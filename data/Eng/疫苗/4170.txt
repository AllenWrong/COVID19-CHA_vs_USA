The upcoming flu season may worsen the novel coronavirus pandemic, experts warned, after studies revealed that coinfection with influenza and COVID could lead to a higher risk of death. Researchers at the University of Liverpool found that symptoms in mice with coinfection of influenza virus and COVID were worse than the individual infections. The results, which were published this week on the preprint server bioRxiv, follow on from a United Kingdom study released last month that found human patients with coinfection had up to six times higher risk of death than the general population.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
