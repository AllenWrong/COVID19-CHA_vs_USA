Climate change constructive to USChina relations
2021-02-19 00:00
Environmental experts and policymakers said that climate change remains a constructive part of the United StatesChina relationship despite tensions in other sectors. They also said the worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases should seize the opportunity to cooperate and discover ways to manage competition in this area.  Its in the US interest to work with China on a range of global issues, and I think thats not obvious to many people, and that ranges from global health to nuclear security, and I think no issue is more important than climate change, said Joanna Lewis, director of Georgetown Universitys science, technology and international affairs program.  During a Feb  webinar hosted by the CaliforniaChina Climate Institute, Lewis said that the Biden administration appointing top climate officials who have experience working with China and have existing relationships with their Chinese counterparts are extremely important signals.  In a similar vein, Lewis said that Chinas reappointment of Xie Zhenhuaa key contributor to USChina climate talksas the countrys special envoy on climate change, is a move that demonstrates Chinas readiness to open a channel of communication with the US on this issue.  Xie and John Kerry, currently President Joe Bidens special envoy for climate, had both worked on the  USChina climate change deal that helped broker the  Paris Agreement.  Its really no coincidence that Xie was reinstated into his role in China, after multiple attempts at retirement, because of course having a bureaucratic counterpart to Kerrys new position is going to be extremely important in China, she added. I think it will make it easier for the US to engage with China and build trust, because we can build on these existing relationships.  Climate could be a constructive part of the USChina relationship, even when other aspects of the relationship are strained, Lewis said.  China and the US are responsible for about  percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions.  During a Jan  news conference, Kerry said the US would work with China on climate change as a critical standalone issue, but the US will never trade other concerns for climate cooperation.  In response, Chinas Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian warned that climate change cooperation with the US cannot be separated from the broader bilateral relationship.  Lewis acknowledged there are concerns in Washington that the US would give in to China on some issues in order to gain a win on climate.  I think the idea that you cannot work on one issue without compromising on others is a false premise, and one that I dont even believe that China would fully agree with. I think that Xies appointment is a clear signal of Chinas readiness to engage, she added.  Zou Ji, CEO and president of Energy Foundation China, said the USChina climate cooperation could restore the worlds trust in multilateralism, especially given the Trump administrations withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and the rise of populism.  We should tell the whole world now the US is coming back. In China, we also see the momentum after President Xi Jinping announced the carbon neutrality target, Zou said. And then the two countries can show the world by their efforts the necessary political track that is still there to work together with the whole world.  David Sandalow, an inaugural fellow at Columbia Universitys Center on Global Energy Policy, said Xi pledging that China will achieve carbon neutrality by  is significant in part because it gives the climate change and clean energy issue a seat at the table in all Chinese decisionmaking.  Going forward, whenever a policy is decided, whenever a permitting decision is made, whenever funding decisions are made, it will be possible within the system to say, to ask the question, does this advance Xis carbon neutrality goal? Sandalow said.  In former Californian governor Jerry Browns opening remarks during the webinar, he said that many are looking at the competition and cooperation between the US and China, given the new Biden administration.  This is a very opportune moment in the history of bilateral relations, and its a very opportune moment in the history of humankind, he said.  Brown, who is also chair of the CaliforniaChina Climate Institute, compared climate change with the challenge posed by COVIDboth of which require international collaboration to tackle.  If we could compete to provide better vaccines, great. If we can compete to provide better electric batteries and better renewable energy resources, and better manufacturing and materials production so we get to zero emissions just as quickly as we can, that would be great, he said.  teresaliuchinadailyusa.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
