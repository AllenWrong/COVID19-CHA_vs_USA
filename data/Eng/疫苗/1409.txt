Coronavirus emerged naturally, says virologist in debunking distortions                                             Virologist Danielle Anderson, the only foreign scientist said to have carried out research at the Wuhan Institute of Virologys BSL Lab, believes the novel coronavirus emerged from a natural source. Anderson, who worked at the lab until November , has largely refrained from commenting publicly on COVID since the onset of the pandemic. The virus that caused the disease likely was a natural acquired infection at some point somewhere, the Australian scientist said. In what appeared to be an exclusive interview with Bloomberg published on Monday, Anderson talked about her experience in the Wuhan facility and said that halftruths and distorted information have obscured an accurate accounting of the labs functions and activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
