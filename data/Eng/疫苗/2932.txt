Drug giant Merck will help make rival Johnson  Johnsons singleshot COVID vaccine, US President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday, as health officials warned states against loosening restrictions too early amid an increase in infections from contagious variants of coronavirus.Biden said the Merck and JJ partnership will mean the US will have enough vaccines for all adults by the end of May, sooner than his previous timeline of the end of July.The president also announced his administration is directing states to prioritize vaccinating teachers, child care workers and school staff through the administrations partnership with pharmacies. Biden said he wants all such educators and support staff to have at least one vaccine shot by the end of March.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
