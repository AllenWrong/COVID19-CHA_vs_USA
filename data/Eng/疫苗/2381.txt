PhotoAgencies    BRUSSELS  The European Medicines Agency EMA confirmed on Wednesday that the occurrence of blood clots with low blood platelets are strongly associated with the administration of AstraZeneca COVID vaccine, but should be still listed as very rare side effects. In its latest assessment, EMA experts told the media that the reported combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is very rare, and the overall benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID outweigh the risks of side effects. EMAs Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee made the conclusion after carrying out an indepth review of the more than  cases reported in the European Union EU data base. The agency thus reminded healthcare professionals and people receiving the vaccine to remain aware of the possibility of the occurrence of the side effects within two weeks of vaccination. So far, most of the cases reported have occurred in women under  years of age within two weeks of vaccination, it added.
