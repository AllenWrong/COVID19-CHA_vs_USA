BEIJING  China has approved three COVID vaccine candidates for clinical trials, said an official with the Ministry of Science and Technology MOST on Tuesday.An adenovirus vector vaccine, developed by a research team led by Chen Wei, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a researcher at the Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, was the first to be approved to enter clinical trials, said Wu Yuanbin, directorgeneral of science and technology for social development with the MOST, at a press conference.The first phase of the clinical trial was completed at the end of March, and the second phase started on April .It is the first COVID vaccine in the world that has entered the second phase of clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization.Accompanied by his daughter, Xiong Zhengxing, an yearold man in Wuhan, was vaccinated on April , becoming the oldest volunteer in the second phase of the clinical trial.Compared with the first phase, the second phase has removed the age ceiling to enroll volunteers over .As the elderly make up a high percentage of the severely ill COVID patients, the vaccine should build a safety shield for them, Chen said.Taking the modified defective adenovirus as the vector, the vaccine carries the gene of the coronavirus spike protein, the major surface protein used by the virus to bind to a receptor to invade cells, so that the subjects body will produce the immunological memory of the protein. When the real coronavirus attacks, the body will identify its spike protein and stop its invasion, according to Chen.The  volunteers who completed the first phase of the clinical trial on March  have ended centralized medical observation and are in good condition.The second phase will recruit  volunteers and introduce the placebo control group to further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine. As of  p.m. on April ,  volunteers had been vaccinated.
