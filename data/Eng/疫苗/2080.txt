But techsavvy volunteers are confronting the countrys health crisis head on with apps to crowdsource vital medical supplies as hospitals buckle under the strain. With the government struggling, the young volunteers are also using social media to direct resources to people in need. A youthled organization called UNCUT has built online databases packed with information about medical resources available across the country. It is a  operation, with the teenagers constantly on their phones as they verify the availability of supplies, update information in realtime and field calls from frantic relatives. The country has witnessed scenes of people dying outside overwhelmed hospitals and funeral pyres lighting up the night sky.

Ashish Jha, dean of Brown Universitys School of Public Health in the United States, said he is concerned that Indian policymakers he has been in contact with believe things will improve in the next few days. Ive been... trying to say to them, If everything goes very well, things will be horrible for the next several weeks. And it may be much longer, he said.
