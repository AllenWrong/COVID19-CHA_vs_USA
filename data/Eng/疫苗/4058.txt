The measures were taken after people voiced their concerns over a new coronavirus strain that has spread from mink to humans in Denmark. British citizens can return from Denmark, but will have to isolate along with all members of their household for  days. Cabin crew are also no longer exempt from the rules, which Ryanair described as a bizarre and baseless move, according to the BBC. The new rules, which began at  a.m.  GMT on Sunday, follow a ban on nonBritish citizens coming to Britain from Denmark. Five socalled clusters of coronavirus mutations derived from farmed minks in Denmark have now been found in  people, and the most problematic cluster  might have resistance to the antibodies with its spike protein, the Danish Statens Serum Institut, a governmental public health and research institution under the Danish Ministry of Health, has said. Passenger planes and ships carrying freight as well as passengers from Denmark will also not be allowed to dock at English ports, said the BBC. The British Department for Transport DfT said the latest rules followed the release of further information from health officials in Denmark. The travel ban and extra requirements will be reviewed after a week, the DfT said. On Thursday, Britain kicked off the second lockdown in England since the outbreak of the COVID pandemic in the country. To bring life back to normal, countries, such as Britain, China, Russia and the United States, are racing against time to develop coronavirus vaccines.
