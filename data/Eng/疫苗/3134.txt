This New Years Eve was special for Zhang. It was the first time the yearold had celebrated the holiday in Shanghai rather than returning to her hometown of Xingtai in Hebei province, which had reported a growing number of cases of the novel coronavirus. On Jan , when she made the decision to remain in Shanghai, Zhang said the idea of spending New Years alone in a rented room far from home sounded miserable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
