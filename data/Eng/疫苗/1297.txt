No one can doubt the COVID pandemic has had a severe impact on the development of the world economy or that it has set back the progress that had been made toward realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

In addition to the almost  million people that have died from COVID, the number of people living in extreme poverty rose for the first time since  last year, when between  million people were pushed back into poverty and chronic hunger, and the equivalent of  million fulltime jobs were lost, according to a United Nations report released at the UN HighLevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development that was convened last week. In addition, the livelihoods of . billion workers in the informal economy have been put at risk because of the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
