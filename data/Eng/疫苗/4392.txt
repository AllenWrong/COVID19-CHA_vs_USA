2020-08-24 22:32
Preface US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his recent speech at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, negated every aspect of ChinaUS relations, maliciously attacked the leadership of the Communist Party of China CPC and Chinas political system, and attempted to drive a wedge between the CPC and the Chinese people. He also wantonly criticized Chinas domestic and foreign policies, spread the socalled China threat, and called for an antiChina alliance to contain Chinas development. Pompeos baseless, factdistorting speech misrepresents history and the reality. It is full of ideological prejudice and driven by a ColdWar mentality. His remarks have not only been condemned by the Chinese people, but also criticized and opposed by sensible people in the United States as well as the international community.        US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks to reporters following a meeting with members of the UN Security Council at UN headquarters in New York, US, August , . PhotoAgencies    To debunk the lies fabricated by Pompeo, let the facts speak for themselves. . Mike Pompeo The Chinese people are completely distinct from the Chinese Communist Party CCP. The biggest lie that they tell is to think that they speak for . billion people. The CCP fears the Chinese peoples honest opinions more than any foe. False. Fact check The Communist Party of China CPC does not have any special interest of its own. It takes seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation as its original aspiration and founding mission. It represents the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority of the Chinese people and remains dedicated to wholeheartedly serving the people. The CPC believes that all is by the people and for the people. It puts the peoples interests first, with safeguarding the peoples interests as the starting point and ultimate goal of all of its work. Under the leadership of the CPC, the Chinese people have won independence, freedom and liberation, and continued to make great achievements in the process of national construction and development.  The CPC comes from the people and is rooted in the people. The CPCs position of leadership is the choice of history and the people. Since its founding  years ago, the CPC has grown from a small party with just more than  members to a large party with nearly  million members. The CPC is deeply rooted in the Chinese people and closely linked to them, and has maintained its great vitality. By the end of , the CPC had . million members and . million applicants for Party membership. It is the worlds largest party that governs the worlds most populous country on a longterm basis. No one can turn a blind eye to the fact that the CPC is supported by the Chinese people. James Palmer, senior editor with the US magazine Foreign Policy, noted that the CPC is deeply woven into the fabric of ordinary Chinese life. It is a common belief that without the party, there would be no new China and trust in the CPC is the mainstream public opinion in China.  Kishore Mahbubani, a professor at the National University of Singapore and former Singaporean ambassador to the United Nations, wrote, in an article carried by The National Interest, that while Pompeo claimed that the Chinese people are completely distinct from the CPC, the fact is that each year a large number of Chinese apply to join the CPC and only a small number of them get in, making it as difficult to join the CPC as it is to get into leading universities in America. The CPC is not a party about to crack up under American pressure as it is floating on an ocean of legitimacy among . billion Chinese people.  The CPC upholds a thinking of development that puts the people in the center. Under the leadership of the CPC, China has seen its per capita GDP increase from less than  yuan in the early s to more than , yuan today, the basic needs of nearly . billion people well met, impoverished population drop by  million, employment provided for  million people, and basic support extended to the  million elderly people,  million people with disabilities and more than  million urban and rural people living on subsistence allowance. China, with a population of nearly . billion, has made a historic leap forward from poverty, to a life of subsistence and to one of moderate prosperity. China has put in place the worlds largest systems for education, social security, health care and democratic elections at the primary level.  Since the COVID outbreak, the CPC and the Chinese government have put the people and their lives front and center, saving lives at all costs and protecting peoples health and safety. Everything possible has been done to treat every patient, whether he or she is  years old or a newborn baby. China has scored major strategic achievements in bringing the virus under control. Chinas economic growth shifted from negative to positive territory in the second quarter this year, up . percent. Chinas economy is seeing the resumption of growth and steady recovery. Experts from the Institute of International Finance, UBS and other wellknown international institutions, as well as media outlets, have expressed optimism about Chinas economic prospects.  At the height of the COVID epidemic when the peoples lives and safety were in grave danger, upon a call for action from the CPC Central Committee, Party members and officials came to the fore. More than . million primarylevel Party organizations operated in full gear. From racing against the clock to save more lives in intensive care units to visiting urban and rural communities for possible infections, from working overtime for production of supplies in factory workshops to pursuing a breakthrough in virus research at laboratories, more than  million Party members had been working day and night at the frontline to fight the epidemic. In this process, nearly  Party members laid down their lives, as they, together with other CPC members, faced danger squarely. The Party flag has always flown high at the front line. All of these speak to the fact that CPC organizations at all levels have acted as strong bastions against the virus and Party members and officials have played an exemplary role. They are the mainstay of the country in this fight.  In August , Ipsos, a wellknown market research company in the world, released a report titled What Worries the World. It found that China led the world in national optimism as  percent of its people believe that their country is going on the right track. China claimed the top spot in  countries surveyed, leaving the United States far behind in the ranking.  In May , Edelman, a renowned communications firm headquartered in the United States, updated its report of Trust Barometer. It revealed that the Chinese people have  percent trust in their government, making the country the top of the countries surveyed, whereas the United States was placed next to last, in the territory of distrust.  In July , the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard Kennedy School made public a survey titled Understanding CCP Resilience Surveying Chinese Public Opinion Through Time. It found that Chinese citizen satisfaction with government has increased virtually across the board since , and people in poorer, inland regions are actually comparatively more likely to report increases in satisfaction. Breakdown data also showed a nearuniversal upturn in the peoples satisfaction toward all four levels of government from  to , with approval ratings running as high as . percent.  The China Data Lab in the University of California, San Diego, recently released an article, saying that the Chinese publics trust in and support of their government have grown from strength to strength. They have significantly rallied since the outbreak of the COVID epidemic. According to this survey, as of May , the average level of trust in the central government has jumped to . on a scale of one to , and  percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed to the statement that they prefer living under Chinas political system as compared to others.  Unlike what the CPC has done for the people in coping with COVID, politicians in the United States held on to the primacy of personal political gains and capital first. To this end, they played down the epidemic, ignored science, and even resorted to blame game. The result is a major outbreak that has taken a heavy toll on Americans lives and health. According to media tallies in May, more than one third of coronavirus deaths in Americas  states came from nursing homes. By Aug. , the United States had recorded a cumulative total of . million confirmed cases, more than  times of that in China. More than , people had died, equivalent to about  deaths per million, which were  times and  times the corresponding numbers in China. With a population of four percent of the worlds total, the United States made up  percent of global infections and  percent of global deaths. The publics anxiety has continued to climb up. Some  percent of Americans in a recent poll reported feeling very concerned or somewhat concerned about the virus. A latest NPRIpsos poll released on Aug.  found that two thirds of respondents said they believe the United States is handling the epidemic worse than other countries. Among them,  percent contended that the countrys performance is much worse than that of other countries, while  percent rated the performance as being somewhat worse. Americans have come to a pretty dire place in the combat, said a pollster with Ipsos, and they are looking for sweeping, really broad, powerful action. The US economy has suffered a heavy blow as its GDP contracted at an annualized rate of . percent in the second quarter, the deepest drop in output since record began in . Fitch, one of the three major credit rating agencies in the world, revised its outlook on the countrys sovereign rating from stable to negative.
