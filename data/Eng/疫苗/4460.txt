Radical ideas to virusproof workspaces

The population density in highrise offices forces physical contact in elevators. Direct contact with surfaces infected with viruses is unavoidable. Centralized air conditioning blows viruses into the office, and the viruses can then circulate in an enclosed area. Personal hygiene precautions are vi                                  The COVID pandemic has upended prior conventions of openplan and highdensity workplaces. A safety radius between workstations, plus plexiglass partitions, personal masks, frequent hand washing, hand sanitation dispensers, temperature readings, and avoiding coughing or sneezing in the open are preventive hygiene disciplines to inhibit the spread of viral infections. Hotdesking is another idea being dumped to reduce viral infections from multiple access to common facilities. Viruses survive on humantouch surfaces for days, and spread through subsequent human contact. Workathome and video conferencing allow staff in the digitally connected world to virtualmeet anywhere, anytime. Virtual meetings Zoom is a widely used virtual conference platform for companies and educational institutions. Security of data privacy is a concern, and the company has promised that data will not be compromised in the United States and Europe. Hong Kongbased International Interior Design launched its BenQ Interactive Flat Panels for collaborative virtual meetings to share notes and presentations on a virtual whiteboard, like at a physical meeting. Virtual conferencing requires adequate bandwidth to work efficiently. Most capital cities are now broadbandenabled, although at peak hours, capacity may be strained because video consumes a lot of the bandwidth capacity. But the frequenttravel jockeys from Hong Kong need not mount airliners so often. Flight and hotel expenses can be cut, while companies save space by rotating their employees between home and office. Meanwhile, the suitability of tiny shared apartments as alternative work spaces in cities like Hong Kong and Tokyo cannot be assumed. It is likely that junior employees take their laptops to Starbucks or similar social locations with broadband availability. Cities with suburban extensions and reliable public transportation like Kuala Lumpur, Taipei and Bangkok are less spaceconstrained when working from home. Office space shrinks Apart from flexible conference rooms for facetoface meetings, the office of tomorrow will need only the minimum space for inoffice staff and document storage. The impact of reduced demand for office space will be significant. Landlords will need to compete on virusproofing buildings, airquality systems, and frequent disinfection of elevator buttons and escalator handrails. Tenant health has become a major factor in leased spaces. Apart from personal hygiene precautions, there will be a critical reexamination of building structures, closed loop airconditioning, fresh air intake, and neglected restrooms. Millions of humans spend eight to  hours daily in these buildings. Some corrective measures are feasible to retrofit existing buildings  if landlords are willing. Companies can migrate away from those buildings that cannot be upgraded for infection control. Highrise buildings need elevators to move people efficiently, but that totally defeats the precautions of social distancing and the risk of contact with viruses on public surfaces. Companies could move to suburban locations with lowrise, lowdensity buildings, at reduced rent. Dieter Kursietis of Gensler HK counsels on flexible workspaces for meetings, and rotation of staff on shifts, to reduce office density. He said such density is bad for infection risk and productivity. Kursietis predicts more pods will be installed in offices for virtual communications at workstations. Gensler has received many inquiries from multinational companies about workplace redesign to address virus infection risk. Social distancing in the office is likely to become a universal code of practice. Cushman  Wakefield, a realestate services firm, introduced the six feet rule for each workstation to have a clear radius from coworkers. It uses directional signage so that employees keep a distance from each other of at least  feet . meters. Outdoor air intake Fresh air is vital to dilute the concentration of viruses and bacteria in buildings and thus reduce the risk of infection. A  study on influenza transmission by Pennsylvania State University found that adequate levels of outdoor air ventilation can equate to having  to  percent of occupants vaccinated. In an influenzavirus experiment, scientists at the University of Maryland found a virus in  percent of aerosol samples, confirming that influenza can transmit through air circulation. The common flu is a seasonal occurrence in Hong Kong, affecting thousands of adults and schoolchildren annually. The elderly and people with respiratory medical conditions are most vulnerable to poor indoor air quality, cautions Peter Cheung, research assistant professor in biomedical engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Cheung references a recent study by Francesca Dominici at Harvard University that found that a minor elevation of longterm exposure even an increase in concentration of  microgram per cubic meter to fine particulate matter less than or equal to . microns can lead to a  percent death rate increase from COVID. Mike Putnam, preconstruction manager at Unispace, a company providing business and commercial interior design solutions, said that an appropriate heating, ventilating, and airconditioning system has to balance occupation density, floor area, use of space, etc. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and AirConditioning Engineers ASHRAE specifies a minimum outdoor ventilation rate of  to  percent. Its protocol for office space is a minimum outdoor ventilation rate of  cubic feet per minute per person, or . cubic feet per minute per square foot. Classrooms need  cubic feet per minute per person, or . cubic feet per minute per sq ft. Sports and entertainment facilities require a higher rate of  cubic feet per minute per person. Roberto Bruzzone, codirector at HKUPasteur Research Centre, School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong, maintains that good outdoor ventilation is important for infectiousdisease control in the densely populated city. Given the citys vehicular trafficpolluted outdoor air, filtration of air intake is especially critical. The filtration system has to be tuned to viral load, distance between people, and time they spend together, which combined, determines transmissions, Bruzzone said. Effective filtration A building airfiltration system removes dust, pollutants, viruses and bacteria. Without an air filter, efforts to control air quality for occupant health are pointless, as the viruses and bacteria circulate in the air, to infect more victims, said Wong Tzewai, adjunct professor of the JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Wong has conducted extensive research into infectious diseases, environmental and occupational health. The more fresh air coming in, the better, Wong said. We have engineering standards for interior design, on indoor temperature, humidity, and air current speed, but these standards are mostly designed for occupants comfort, not to control viral infection risk, he added. Douglas Newkirk, design director at Gensler HK, said the firm has received inquiries to improve ventilation in toilets and common areas. Newkirk said that in older buildings, a single ventilation system serves all stalls in public toilets. The ideal is to have independent ventilation for each cubicle, Newkirk said. Research has indicated that the toilet plume generated after flushing spreads infection via aerosol particles through the air and into airconditioning circulation. Virusinfected feces and vomit are particularly dangerous, he said. While air filtration systems are nominally available in modern commercial buildings in Hong Kong, Annette Chan of Goudie Associates, one of the partners of the Savvi Design and Build Platform, said they are mostly inadequate. Many independent airconditioning systems have more effective filtration of harmful particles. The Savvi platform uses data and artificial intelligence to match offmarket options for tenants, with landlord and agency partnerships. HEPA standard Unispace follows the Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value MERV, a scale designed by the ASHRAE to assess the efficiency of air filters. Putnam references the international highefficiency particulate air HEPA standard. A HEPA certified air filter must remove at least . percent of particles . microns in diameter. The HEPA standard is used for contamination control in the manufacture of disk drives, medical equipment, semiconductors, food, nuclear plants, and pharmaceuticals. It also applies to homes, vehicles and hospitals. After COVID, the filtration for office space is raised to MERV  or higher, closer to healthcare filtration, Putnam said. The coronavirus can be transmitted in droplets exhaled from an infected person, through coughing, sneezing, and talking, as virusladen fluid smaller than  microns. It can linger in the air for up to three hours. Portable air purifiers come in handy at this particular time, especially welcome in small offices in Hong Kong. A floorstanding air purifier invented by Aurabeat, a startup in Hong Kong Science Park, works using silver ion, plasma and ultraviolet technologies. The company said it can eliminate the coronavirus and . percent of bacteria, with effective coverage ranging from  to  sqm. IAQ guidance The governments guidance for green buildings stresses the importance of indoor air quality IAQ as people spend more than  percent of their time indoors. The guidance recommends two major approaches for better IAQ  adequate ventilation, and control of the source of indoor air pollutants. The government launched an IAQ Certification Scheme for Offices and Public Places in September  to encourage property owners and management to implement IAQ guidelines. It is voluntary and few have responded. There is a lack of enforcement, said Alex Yeung, founder of Bravolinear, a company specializing in air purifying technologies. He said incentives are not enough, and that the IAQ should be mandatory for new buildings. The AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation body found that only  out of its  member economies had mandatory regulations pertaining to IAQ  the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand, and Mexico. Antiviral treatment Human contact of public surfaces contributes to respiratory pathogen transmissions, Bruzzone said. A University of Arizona study in  showed a single contaminated doorknob or elevator button could spread viruses to  percent of other sampled surfaces  such as light switches, countertops, coffeepot handles, faucet handles, and computer equipment  within two to four hours. Surfaces repeatedly touched should be given special coating or finishes of materials with antimicrobial properties like copper, silver and brass. They can also be woven into fabrics, such as carpets and upholstery. However, treatment with such antimicrobial materials is expensive, said Albert de Plazaola, Unispaces global strategy leader. You have to use it tactically, and sparingly, he said. Moreeconomical alternatives are smooth and nonporous materials that are easily cleaned. Antibacterial or antimicrobial plastic and polyurethane, for instance, can withstand heavy cleaning and disinfection, de Plazaola said. Chan of Goudie Associates added that rollout mats are preferable to carpets for building entrances and lobbies as they better trap viruses and dirt, and withstand frequent cleaning. Smart technology How can we save lives through smart technology? Newkirk of Gensler asked rhetorically. Touchless elevators, wavemotion entry doors, touchless faucets, automatic doors in bathrooms, touchless coffeemakers controlled via mobile apps, touchless lighting sensors Radiofrequency identification chipembedded ID cards can allow contactless security screening, he said. Hong Kong people have privacy concerns over facial recognition technology, Newkirk said. If you find touchfree technology too costly, you may consider handsfree, Newkirk said. Infrared rays at the door can detect the temperature of people before opening automatically, or foot paddles can fling the door open. Ultraviolet light is a potential agent to sanitize viruses in office workspaces. However, there is no international standard for optimal light intensity, duration, and how spaces underneath desks, on the floor, and in bookshelves can be effectively sanitized by ceiling UV lighting, he said.
