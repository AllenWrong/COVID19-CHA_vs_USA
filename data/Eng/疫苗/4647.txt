EU joins chorus of disapproval as medical experts say unity is crucial                                            The planned withdrawal by the United States from the World Health Organization is a senseless, awful decision that would be an enormous disruption during an unprecedented crisis that calls for multilateralism, health experts and politicians have said.Just about  days after he sent a letter to the WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus threatening to freeze US funding permanently if the organization did not make unspecified substantive changes in a month, US President Donald Trump on Friday said the organization had failed to make reforms and the US would quit.We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and directing those funds to worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs, Trump said in a brief statement in the White House Rose Garden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
