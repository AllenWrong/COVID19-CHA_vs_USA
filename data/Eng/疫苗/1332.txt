BEIJING  The choice is in our hands and the responsibility falls on our shoulders.That was what Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China CPC Central Committee, said during the CPC and World Political Parties Summit held via video link on Tuesday, as he called on political parties in the world to shoulder their responsibility for the pursuit of peoples wellbeing and progress of mankind.Xis speech is visionary and insightful, said Argentine President Alberto Fernandez, also president of the countrys Justicialist Party.The cloud summit, which gathered leaders of more than  political parties and organizations from over  countries, was the latest of an array of diplomatic occasions where the Chinese leader offered Chinas solutions to daunting challenges facing humanity.By attending six important multilateral events, and engaging in nearly  phone calls, messages and virtual meetings in the form of cloud diplomacy this year, Xi has made such pledges and proposals on the antipandemic fight, common development, environmental governance and multilateralism that keep resonating across the world.ANTIPANDEMIC FIGHTIn a phone conversation held on Jan.  with his Bolivian counterpart, Luis Arce, Xi said China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Bolivia on COVID vaccines.Recalling that China has provided Bolivia with material and technical assistance to fight the epidemic through various channels, the Chinese president said his country will continue supporting Bolivia in the antiepidemic fight within its capacity.Some  days later, Chinese Sinopharm COVID vaccines arrived at Viru Viru International Airport in the Latin American country.Ever since the onset of the COVID pandemic, Xi has repeatedly stressed on the importance of global antipandemic cooperation.The ancient Roman philosopher Seneca said, We are all waves of the same sea. Let us join hands and stand shoulder to shoulder with each other to firmly advance international cooperation against COVID, build a global community of health for all, and work for a healthier and brighter future for humanity, Xi said in late May at the Global Health Summit.He also made a fivepoint proposal at the summit, namely putting people and their lives first, following sciencebased policies and ensuring a coordinated and systemic response, sticking together and promoting solidarity and cooperation, upholding fairness and equity to close the immunization gap, and addressing both the symptoms and root causes to improve the governance system.Under Xis guidance, China has made great contributions to the global antipandemic fight. It has provided more than  million doses of COVID vaccines to nearly  countries, and pledged to provide the first batch of  million doses of vaccines to the World Health Organization WHO led COVAX.COVID has shown how a small virus has actually frozen us globally, our movement, our activities, and our interaction, former Malaysian Ambassador to China Abdul Majid Ahmad Khan told Xinhua. So the only way to combat this is through cooperation, through the sharing of common interest, I think that is the way forward.As the whole world is facing unprecedented challenges, mutual respect, mutual help, reaching consensus through consultation and close cooperation have become more urgent than ever, said Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.COMMON DEVELOPMENTFrom May , the first China International Consumer Products Expo CICPE was held in Haikou, the capital of South Chinas Hainan province.A total of  countries and regions attended the fourday expo, and , brands of , enterprises from home and abroad participated in the exhibitions.In his congratulatory message to the expo, Xi said the expo, serving as a global platform of displaying and trading highend consumer products, is conducive to all countries sharing opportunities provided by the Chinese market and conducive to global economic recovery and growth. It will also enable China to offer the world more quality consumer products.Apart from the CICPE, other highend international expos such as the decadesold Canton Fair and the yearold China International Import Expo have also demonstrated Chinas commitment to wider openingup and mutual benefits.China has done its best to promote SouthSouth cooperation and provide assistance for developing countries, Xi said in a phone conversation with United Nations UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres in early May, adding that this is Chinas consistent practice as well as its moral responsibility.Indeed, by pushing forward such proposals as the Belt and Road Initiative BRI, China has been taking the lead to inject fresh momentum into the global economy, and deliver confidence to the international community.Since the first ChinaEurope freight train left southwest Chinas Chongqing Municipality in March , China has launched the service in more than  cities domestically, connecting them with major European countries, which has recorded more than , trips.Just as Xi said in late April at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference , the BRI is a public road open to all, not a private path owned by one single party.Going forward, we will continue to work with other parties in highquality Belt and Road cooperation, Xi said, adding, We will act in the spirit of openness and inclusiveness as we work with all willing participants to build the BRI into a pathway to poverty alleviation and growth.Jose Luis Centella, president of the Communist Party of Spain, said the BRI was born to meet the needs of the times, which has not only become an important international cooperation platform, but also provided a great opportunity for the world economy to recover from the pandemic.China, through the further implementation of the policy of reform and opening up and the development of the BRI, will inject impetus to other countries economic development, said Yulia Tymoshenko, leader of the Fatherland party of Ukraine.ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCEFaced with unprecedented challenges in global environmental governance, the international community needs to come up with unprecedented ambition and action. We need to act with a sense of responsibility and unity, and work together to foster a community of life for man and Nature, Xi said in late April at the virtual Leaders Summit on Climate.Through various similar occasions, Xi has reiterated the importance of closer cooperation in green development.On May , Xi and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, witnessed the groundbreaking ceremony of a bilateral nuclear energy cooperation project of Tianwan nuclear power plant and Xudapu nuclear power plant, via video link.It is necessary to promote the building of a global energy governance system featuring justice, equity, balance, inclusiveness, openness and shared benefits, and contribute more solutions to global energy governance, Xi said at the ceremony, adding, Responding to climate change is a common task for all countries.From the remote sensing satellites in Ethiopia to a lowcarbon demonstration zone project in Laos, China has been trying its best to help developing countries address climate change. Its ambition to peak its carbon emissions by  and achieve carbon neutrality by , its joint statement with the United States on climate change cooperation, and its upcoming hosting of the th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity COP have all demonstrated the countrys dedication to a fair and reasonable system of global environmental governance.China is ready to work with Europe to ensure positive outcomes at the COP, and the th session of the Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Xi said Monday during a virtual summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Xis statement reflects the importance China attaches to the global ecological environment, its determination to actively work to promote global climate governance and strengthen climate cooperation, said Guo Jie, principal professor of finance at Durham University in Britain, adding that it shows the sense of responsibility of a great power, which injects strong positive energy into the global process of combating climate change.UPHOLDING MULTILATERALISMOn June , Xi and Putin issued a joint statement, in which the two heads of state pledged to protect global strategic security and stability, support and practice true multilateralism, oppose interference in other countries affairs under the guise of democracy and human rights, and resist unilateral coercive sanctions.In the eyes of Xi, upholding and practicing genuine multilateralism is the only right way toward solving global challenges.The problems facing the world are intricate and complex. The way out of them is through upholding multilateralism and building a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi said in late January when addressing the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda.All countries should follow the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, uphold true multilateralism, and make the global governance system more fair and equitable, Xi said later at the Boao Forum.This year marks the th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of the Peoples Republic of China in the UN, the th anniversary of Chinas accession to the World Trade Organization, and the th anniversary of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Calling China a pillar of multilateralism, Guterres said he expects China to continue its proactive policies to strengthen the UNs global work on maintaining peace and security and encouraging sustainable development.Multilateralism remains the most viable path for countries to collectively pull together in providing sustainable solutions to challenges afflicting humanity, said Kenyabased international relations scholar Cavince Adhere.
