The World Health Organization WHO called it agile, aggressive and ambitious, the three characteristics of the way China dealt with the pandemic, Therese Hesketh, a professor of global health at the University College London UCL, told Xinhua in a recent interview. The professor, who is also the director of the Center for Global Health at Chinas Zhejiang University, recalled that she was actually in China from October through December last year, and at that time in China life had returned to normal and that I had the experience of the postCOVID time. They had a very strong trackandtrace, which is extremely efficient, keeping track of peoples movements and closing borders, she said. The expert also said that China has acted immediately to control the situation following the most recent emergence of some local outbreaks. In China things happen quickly. No one is sitting around deciding what to do, they just get on with it, she said. I think we can learn a lot about what China has done in terms of this outbreak, in terms of the control of any pandemic in the future, she said.
