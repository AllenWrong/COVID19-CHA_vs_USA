WASHINGTON  The World Bank on Tuesday announced that its Board of Executive Directors has approved  billion US dollars for developing countries to finance the purchase and distribution of COVID vaccines, tests and treatments for their citizens.The financing, which aims to support vaccination of up to  billion people, is part of an overall World Bank package of up to  billion dollars through June  to help developing countries fight the pandemic, according to a statement.It adds new financing to the World Banks COVID emergency response programs that are reaching  countries, the statement noted.We are extending and expanding our fasttrack approach to address the COVID emergency so that developing countries have fair and equal access to vaccines, World Bank Group President David Malpass said.Access to safe and effective vaccines and strengthened delivery systems is key to alter the course of the pandemic and help countries experiencing catastrophic economic and fiscal impacts move toward a resilient recovery, Malpass said.Global COVID cases surpassed  million as of Tuesday night, with more than  million deaths recorded, according to a realtime datatracking tool developed at Johns Hopkins University.In its latest World Economic Outlook report released Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund IMF projected the global economy to contract by . percent in , warning that the ascent out of this crisis is likely to be long, uneven, and highly uncertain.The virus is resurging with localized lockdowns being reinstituted. If this worsens and prospects for treatments and vaccines deteriorate, the toll on economic activity would be severe, and likely amplified by severe financial market turmoil, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said at a virtual press conference.On the upside, Gopinath noted, faster and more widespread availability of COVID tests, treatments, vaccines, and additional policy stimulus can significantly improve the outlook.
