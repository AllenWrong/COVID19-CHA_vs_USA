The World Health Organization, or WHO, warned on Tuesday against pinning hopes on herd immunity as a salvation to stop the spread of COVID in the foreseeable future. The New York Times reported on Monday that more than a dozen scientists interviewed by the paper said that the threshold to reach herd immunity is likely to be much lower than the  percent previously suggested. The report said  percent, perhaps even less. If thats true, then it may be possible to turn back the coronavirus more quickly than once thought, the report said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
