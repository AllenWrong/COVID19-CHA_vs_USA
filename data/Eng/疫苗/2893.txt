Hong Kong is and will remain one of the worlds freest economies

Undoubtedly, the last two years have been very challenging for Hong Kong, socially and economically, and  is not any easier either. The  civil unrest was seamlessly followed by the ravages of the COVID pandemic. COVID is plunging its embattled economy further into recession. The unemployment rate jumped to . percent in the OctobertoDecember period from . percent previously, returning to levels not seen since December , according to a government report, getting worse to  percent in January as the coronavirus fourth wave took a toll.       Local businesses are struggling under strict social distancing measures and a lack of tourism the arrival of visitors declined drastically, with restrictions on group gatherings. However, we can try to see the glass half full, instead of half empty When it comes to civil unrest and the riots that ravaged the special administrative region in  and early , the National Security Law seems to have quelled the unrest, whereas, even though Hong Kong is not free from the effects of the pandemic, it has managed to keep the number of COVID infections well under control compared with many other places in the world, and the citys massive financial reserves were able to help employers avoid some job cuts that would have made the pain even worse than it has been. And, now that vaccination is being rolled out in the region, we can expect the situation to improve these coming months and I am sure that we will eventually see Hong Kong partially reopening its borders, by resuming the travel bubble project with Singapore and similar projects. In the midst of all these challenges, we recently had some news that could not come at a worse time The Heritage Foundation has just dropped Hong Kong from its  Index of Economic Freedom, a list which is topped by Singapore, in a decision which also affects Chinas other special administrative region, Macao. Basically, the Heritage Foundation said its annual Index of Economic Freedom, issued last Thursday, no longer included Hong Kong and Macao because it measures economic freedom only in independent countries where governments exercise sovereign control of economic policies. In other words, the Foundation implies that the governments of both Hong Kong and Macao have lost their autonomy in formulating economic policies. According to the Foundation, while Hong Kong and Macao enjoy more economic freedom than the Chinese mainland, developments in recent years have demonstrated unambiguously that those policies are ultimately controlled from Beijing. To me, the decision of removing Hong Kong and Macao from the Index is completely wrong and biased, and shows a profound lack of understanding of how one country, two systems works, as well as a profound lack of understanding of what the National Security Law was and what it actually implied for Hong Kong. Let me start from the beginning Following the  SinoBritish Joint Declaration, Hong Kong returned to China in  under the one country, two systems principle, by which the region continues to enjoy its distinct political, socioeconomic and legal arrangements under a unified China  for at least fifty years without change note at least, which means that  does not need to be at all the end of the one country, two systems formula. So far, one country, two systems has worked well, allowing Hong Kong to become stronger than it was, albeit during the  riots. Actually, in , exactly  years after the handover, I did some research comparing, from a socioeconomic perspective, Hong Kong of  with Hong Kong of . The data shows that Hong Kong was in better shape in  than in . While Hong Kong peoples life expectancy increased by eight years for men and women to  and  years respectively, over that period, the public rental housing stock increased from , apartments in  to more than , in . The thing that makes some people claim that one country, two systems has been undermined is the promulgation of the National Security Law NSL last year, But lets make no mistake, the law was not and will not be an attempt to undermine Hong Kongs normal status quo, but simply a tool to put an end to the unsustainable situation that Hong Kong was living in due to the social unrest. As I mentioned in Security law will secure future of Hong Kong June , , China Daily HK Edition, almost every nation has laws to protect its national security, including the US. Some businessmen and investors have been worried over the national security law. But the new legislation has proven to be beneficial because it brought back stability and security whilst preserving Hong Kongs special status, which has not been challenged. Back in June, senior Chinese officials tasked with the Hong Kong portfolio publicly asserted that . percent of Hong Kong people will not be affected by this new law, since it targets only separatist activities, subversion of State power, terrorism and foreign interference. Nine months later, I reckon that most Hong Kong citizens can state that they have indeed not been affected by the NSL in any negative way and their lives have not changed, at least not due to the NSL. So if the US also has laws to protect national security, as most countries do, and if most similar laws in other countries are actually harsher, what is all the fuss about? Hong Kong has been treated as a chess piece in the USSino rivalry initiated by former US President Donald Trump, which has been labeled by some as a new cold war. As Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mopo said, the city still enjoys economic competitiveness, with the free flow of capital continuing under one country, two systems and the rule of law is respected in the city. In other words, regardless of what changes have been made to the economic freedom index, Hong Kong remains one of the worlds freest economies, one of the most important global financial hubs and one of the best places in the world to do business in.
