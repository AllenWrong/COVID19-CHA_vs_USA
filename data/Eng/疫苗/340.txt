A Jackson State University footballer receives his COVID vaccination on campus in Jackson, Mississippi in July. Several months since COVID vaccinations were made widely available in the US, the subject continues to disrupt professional and college sports. AP    Leagues get tough as financial considerations change holdouts minds National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman let out a faint cough and assured those seated nearby that it was allergies, not COVID. He had tested negative for the coronavirus three times in the previous week. It allowed the fully vaccinated yearold the opportunity to underscore the message that the virus is still part of the NHL and other professional sports leagues  months into the pandemic. Its no joke, Bettman said. Were still dealing with COVID, although not in the same ways. US sports have successfully forced more athletes and staff to get vaccinated than many other industries, in part because the threat of losing pay is so severe. Yet, the outliers have and will continue to get more attention and generate outrage from fans who want to see stars play. Basketballs Kyrie Irving and Bradley Beal, footballs Kirk Cousins, Cole Beasley and Chase Young, baseballs Chris Sale and hockeys Tyler Bertuzzi have all held out, with varying degrees of outspoken skepticism. On Monday, the NHL suspended San Joses Evander Kane  games for submitting a fake vaccination card and Washington State University fired football coach Nick Rolovich for failing to comply with a state government vaccine mandate, providing two more reminders of the impact the coronavirus is still having on professional and college sports. Theyre in the shrinking minority.        Los Angeles Dodgers president and CEO Stan Kasten addresses a new conference held at the launch of a mass COVID vaccination site at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles in January. AP    Major League Baseball, in the middle of its postseason, reports . percent of players and key staff are fully vaccinated. The NFL through six weeks of its season is at  percent, with  active players who have not had at least one dose. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Monday his league is at  percent with the chance for that number to tick up. Bettman noted last week the NHL had only four unvaccinated players out of more than well over  percent vaccinated. If given grades, those are Apluses, said former womens basketball player Iciss Tillis, who is now a labor and employment attorney at law firm Hall Estill. Its been really interesting to watch the transition over the past year and a half go from extreme skepticism to people being able to see friends and family go ahead and get the vaccine first and sort of see how they react to it. I think thats playing a huge role in this shift that were seeing toward people pretty much just giving in and just going ahead and taking the vaccine. None of those leagues has a full mandate, but all imposed rules that treat players who are fully vaccinated differently. In addition, some cities and states put further requirements on players and coaches, especially those at state universities such as Rolovich. Daily coronavirus testing, mask wearing and restrictions on movement made more players choose to be vaccinatedas did the threat of losing pay. The NBAs Brooklyn Nets began the season without Irving, who cannot play or practice at home because of a New York City vaccine mandate. The team told him he couldnt playeven in road gamesuntil his status changes. Irving and other unvaccinated players around pro sports dont get paid for the games they miss. For athletes in particular, their livelihood is based on their ability to compete, said Dr. Wendy King of the University of Pittsburgh, who took part in a research project on vaccine hesitancy earlier this year. Even if they thought, Oh, Im pretty healthy and I wouldnt get that bad of a case, it would still heavily impact their ability to go to work, to play in a game. It could affect their entire teamnot just themso they might feel like theyre letting other people down if they dont do everything they can to prevent the disease. Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos of Johns Hopkins University said job security and the threat of losing pay likely led to such a high vaccine uptake among athletes. I think thats a powerful thing, he said. It convinced some to get jabbed.        Jniya Tallie, a graduate assistant with the Jackson State womens basketball team, consults with a nurse after receiving her second vaccine dose in July. AP    Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wigginswho faced a potential absence similar to Irvings because of a local mandatedecided to get a COVID vaccine to be eligible to play. The NHLs agreement to go to the Beijing Winter Olympics requires all participants to be fully vaccinated, which could lead New Jersey Devils goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood to change his mind. Leagues have still endured COVID cases involving fully vaccinated players, coaches and staff. Deep in baseballs playoffs, the Atlanta Braves opened the National League Championship Series without Jorge Soler, who tested positive, and the NHLs Pittsburgh Penguins started the season without winger Jake Guentzel. Isolated absences are expected, Bettman said, because of the highly contagious Delta variant. Weve got to maintain our vigilance and be serious, Bettman said. Im really proud of our players. All of our officials are vaccinated. All of our personnel who come near our players are vaccinated, and thats what weve got to do. But we cant let up. Its a fact of life and its not just us. Its what the world is still living with. One of hockeys biggest stars, Colorados Nathan MacKinnon, missed the first two games of the season after testing positive with a breakthrough case. Coach Jared Bednar hopes a combination of the entire team being vaccinated and many having already contracted COVID allows the Avalanche and the league in general to stay on track this season. MacKinnon was back on the ice Tuesday, thankful for his vaccination status and ready to play again. Nobody got sick, no teammates got sick, so thats lucky, he said. Didnt feel anything, so the vaccine must work. Agencies Via Xinhua
