Resuming HKmainland personnel flows vital to economy

With the latest measure banning all passenger flights from Britain effective since Thursday, Hong Kong is once again on high alert against the highly contagious Delta variant. Several Delta variant cases have been reported in Hong Kong. The first was a yearold airport employee who works parttime at Uptown Plaza in Tai Po. The second case was traced to another Uptown Plaza employee. Both individuals lived in the same residential block in Tai Po. According to epidemiologist Professor Gabriel Leung Cheukwai, dean of the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong, one infected person can spread the variant to eight people. Reports from Guangdong province health authorities have found that without the use of face masks, the variant can be transmitted from person to person within eight seconds. Public Health England in the United Kingdom has warned that the Delta variant is  percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which led to the first UK lockdown last spring. Due to the virulent nature of this variant, over , cases were confirmed in the UK between June  and . The British government even had to delay its socalled Freedom Day to July . The total lifting of lockdown restrictions was originally scheduled for June . Even with nearly half of the UK population having received full vaccinations, and the government having prepared for a third wave of infections, the vaccination rate has proved inadequate to achieve herd immunity. The situation in Israel is another example that calls into question the efficacy of vaccinations on the community level. Even in one of the leading countries for nationwide vaccination, nearly half of the newly confirmed carriers of the Delta variant were vaccinated adults. Over  percent of Israeli residents aged  and above have received the full doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine. Thankfully, up to now, Hong Kong hasnt been as badly affected by the Delta variant. And as I have warned time and time again, the vaccine alone is not a guarantee against an evermutating virus. Personal hygiene, maskwearing, and continued vigilance must also be part of the regime. And with the summer holidays fast approaching, many Hong Kong people studying overseas in countries such as the UK and the United States will be flying home away from the outbreaks as soon as they can. Knowing this, we must act swiftly to curb the importation of infections from abroad. The shortage of hotel rooms for quarantine is also a matter of concern for the special administrative region government, and a solution has yet to be found. The need to remain cautious and receive our vaccinations is not simply a matter of protecting ourselves and others around us, but also ensuring the citys continued survival. The pandemic has cost our economy over HK billion . billion, according to George Leung Siukay, chief executive of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. As private businesses offer all kinds of lucrative incentives to encourage vaccination, we need to consider the short and longterm benefits of reopening the border with the Chinese mainland. According to Chinas top epidemiologist, Zhong Nanshan, a gradually reopened Hong Kongmainland border could come as soon as this month. Of course, this will be down to safe and sensible coordination on the part of both the SAR government and the central government. The Returnhk program  which allows Hong Kong residents returning from the mainland or Macao to be exempted from the day quarantine requirement  is a good start, but this is still not enough to stimulate our stagnant economy. It is hoped that the Comehk program, which allows mainland residents a similar exemption, will also be launched before long. Given the strong economic, family and social ties between the two sides, it is imperative that we resume the ties and encourage mainland visitors to come to Hong Kong and inject life back into our city and its economy. We need travel in both directions between the two sides if we want our city to get back on its feet. We could first allow users of the Comehk program to visit solely for business and trade purposes, followed by family visits and tourism from across the border. We all know how well the mainland has managed the pandemic, so it is a logical course of action to allow mainland residents to visit Hong Kong without having to endure a lengthy quarantine period. Since we are allowing Hong Kong residents to come back from the mainland without quarantine, it is entirely reasonable and viable to extend the same to mainland residents. A virus is an indiscriminate being. If a traveler is coming into Hong Kong from a safe place, it is entirely logical to allow them quarantinefree access to Hong Kong, regardless of their nationality subject to a negative COVID test result, of course. And if by any chance the Comehk program leads to a resurgence in cases, our government can simply suspend the program until further notice. If swift and decisive action is taken when required, these two programs can be carried out without fear. Therefore, it is absolutely safe, scientifically and medically, to start Comehk. It is absolutely necessary economically to start Comehk. And with Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China, it is totally correct politically to start Comehk. I urge the SAR government to act now.
