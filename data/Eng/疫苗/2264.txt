By hoarding vaccines, the Western world has left many in emerging economies uncovered. While more than  million doses have been administered, countries with the highest incomes are getting vaccinated  times faster than those with the lowest, said the article written by Clara Ferreira Marques, a columnist with Bloomberg. According to Bloombergs COVID tracker, the United States, which makes up about  percent of the worlds population, has  percent of vaccinations, the article said. Whats more, the article noted that the Chinese vaccines are highly effective against severe diseases, which can significantly reduce the number of hospitalizations. For emerging economies like the Philippines or Brazil, its important to stop infection, but vital to avoid severe cases and to keep people out of hospitals, where they can rapidly overwhelm healthcare networks that are rickety at the best of times, the report said. The article also cited Indonesia as an example and said that as a major recipient of Sinovac doses that needs to vaccinate  million people within a year, the country is not wrong that the best vaccine is the one thats available. A population that has very high coverage of Sinovac would certainly have far fewer severe COVID cases, even with substantial infection and transmission, Benjamin Cowling, professor at the University of Hong Kongs School of Public Health, was quoted by the article as saying. Thats a win of sorts, Cowling points out.
