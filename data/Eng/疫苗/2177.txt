Weeks after New Delhi appealed to Washington for the raw materials needed for the production of COVID vaccines, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Friday that the United States first and foremost duty is to vaccinate the American people. Two days after that statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted on Sunday Our hearts go out to the Indian people we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and Indias healthcare heroes. Later on the same day, US President Joe Biden said on Twitter... we are determined to help India in its time of need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
