The WHA, the World Health Organizations highest decisionmaking body, refused on Monday to include a proposal on Taiwans participation in its agenda. From  to , Taiwan participated in the WHA as an observer under the name Chinese Taipei. However, since , after the Democratic Progressive Party, which leans toward independence, took office in May , the island has been barred from the assembly.

Taiwan has effective access to information and aid on COVID prevention and control, she said. The mainland has notified Taiwan of pandemicrelated information  times and agreed to allow health experts from Taiwan to participate in WHO technical activities  times since the outbreak in , she said. The channels for cooperation have been kept open for Taiwan to handle the pandemic, and the region can receive information or assistance without joining the WHA as an observer, said Betty Yuan, a Chinese for Peaceful UnificationNorthern California council member. Their true aim is trying to politicize the matter instead of doing good for the Taiwan people, said Yuan, who is originally from Taiwan and is a longtime community leader in the San Francisco Bay Area.        Photochinadaily.com.cn    As the pandemic is still raging in the island, residents recently urged the islands DPP administration to buy mainland vaccines to replenish lacking supplies and keep the situation from deteriorating. In response, Zhu said the mainland is willing to arrange a prompt purchase of COVID vaccines from the mainland and to send epidemic prevention and control experts to Taiwan. Wu Yifang, chairman of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, said in a recent Xinhua News Agency interview that the company is willing to provide Taiwan with COVID vaccines. Fosun signed a contract with BioNTech to participate in the research and development of vaccine products of Germanys BioNTech and has exclusive rights to the vaccine on the Chinese mainland and in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Taiwan officials from the DPP rejected the mainlands help offer and said the gesture was made in order to mislead the public into blaming the islands authorities. Zhu said the socalled claim by the DPP that there is a gap in global antivirus efforts if Taiwan is not able to participate in the WHA is a political lie and an excuse used by the political party to seek independence. She urged the DPP authorities not to go further down the wrong path, saying, Any attempt to challenge the oneChina principle is bound to end in failure. The DPPs attempt to participate in the WHA is actually to create Taiwan independence at a time when the pandemic continues to plague the region, said Sam Ng, honorary president of the Committee to Promote the Reunification of ChinaSan Francisco. The leaders should focus on fighting the virus. If they are really concerned about the peoples health, they should accept the mainlands vaccines.
