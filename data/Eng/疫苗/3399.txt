The minister explained that clinical trials have proved Sinopharm vaccine is safe and highly effective in COVID prevention, especially in prevention of COVID infection with severe symptoms. She added that Sinopharm vaccine has been registered at the Egyptian Drug Authority EDA and other vaccines from China, Britain and Russia will be registered within days. Egypt received on Dec ,  the first batch of Sinopharm vaccine, and the vaccine was officially licensed for emergency use later in the same month, after going through four tests conducted by the EDA. The vaccination program starts with the medical staff of the hospitals of the Egyptian Health Ministry, the armed forces and the police. Starting from tomorrow, the medical staff of all Egyptian public hospitals, and those of the armed forces and the police, will start receiving these vaccines, Zayed told reporters. The priorities, according to the vaccination campaign, are given to medical staff dealing with COVID patients, followed by those dealing with other patients, the elderly, those with chronic or immunity diseases, and the rest of the citizens.
