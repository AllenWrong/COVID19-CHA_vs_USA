HAVANAThe Communist Party of Cuba has condemned attempts by the United States to manipulate the origins tracing of COVID for political gains, according to a statement published on the partys website.The report on the COVID origins compiled by US intelligence community politicizes, stigmatizes and singularizes COVID origins, said Juan Carlos Marsan Aguilera, deputy head of the international relations department of the PCC Central Committee.During the Sao Paulo Forum held online on Thursday, Aguilera said the US report lacked scientific evidence and clarity, adding that the joint report on origins tracing done by the World Health Organization and Chinese scientists earlier this year has already laid out scientific, professional and authorized conclusions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
