The team was led by senior bioengineer Major General Chen Wei. Since arriving in Wuhan, Central Chinas Hubei province, in late January, Chen and her team immediately began working on a subunit vaccine. The vaccine has been approved for safety, efficacy and quality by a third party. Chen said the vaccine also has completed preliminary preparation work for mass production. A subunit vaccine is a type of vaccine that contains only a fragment of the pathogen to stimulate a protective immune response, according to the World Health Organization. It is considered safer and more stable than liveattenuated vaccines, which contain a weakened version of the live pathogen, but it may not elicit as strong a protection as liveattenuated versions.
