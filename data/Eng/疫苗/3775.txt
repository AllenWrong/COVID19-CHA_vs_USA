Speaking to reporters ahead of a customary meeting of her Executive Council on Tuesday, Lam appealed to residents not to drop their guards and stay at home as much as they could during the upcoming holiday season. Lam said her government planned to apply to the Legislative Council for a fourth tranche of antiepidemic funding before the Christmas holidays in order to help businesses affected by the COVID curbs. The city recorded more than  cases during each of the past three weeks, although the number has slightly dropped recently. Hong Kong logged  new COVID infections on Monday, including  untraceable local cases, second only to  cases of an unknown origin recorded on Sunday. The Hong Kong government announced on Friday that the first batch comprising  million shots of coronavirus vaccines, developed by Beijingbased Sinovac Biotech, will be shipped to Hong Kong next month at the earliest. Lam criticized people who were trying to stigmatize or politicize the purchase and eventual use of vaccines, iterating that vaccine procurement had been done scientifically and that the process had been vetted by medical experts.
