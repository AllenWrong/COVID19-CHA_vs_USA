US sanctions hinder Iranians right to healthcare, experts say

With little progress in talks surrounding the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, blanket sanctions imposed by the United States and some allies against Iran should not compromise its peoples right to health, experts say. Overcompliance with USimposed sanctions had harmed Iranian peoples health rights, particularly those with the rare skin disease epidermolysis bullosa, many of whom are children, according to an October statement by the UN Human Rights Council. A Swedish company making EB bandages has halted shipments to Iran, fearing secondary sanctions, and many banks and businesses worldwide, including pharmaceutical and medical companies overcomply to avoid the risk of potential penalties, the statement said. Arhama Siddiqa, a research fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, said the UNs use of the word overcompliance indicates the sanctions go beyond what is required to curb uranium enrichment. Siddiqa said broad embargoes have constrained Teherans ability to import vital supplies, hindrances that have pushed Iran toward domestic COVID vaccine research and developing its own vaccine. In June, it announced the emergency use of COVIran Barakat, its first domestic vaccine. It should be noted that while Iran produces the most basic of drugs, it relies on imports of more advanced medicines. For Iran, COVID as well as US sanctions have become twin tribulations, Siddiqa said. Mehran Kamrava, director of the Iranian Studies Unit at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, a think tank in Doha, Qatar, said that theoretically, US sanctions should not apply to medical and humanitarian cases. But in practice, this has not been the case. Even in the rare instances when exemptions have been made on medical or humanitarian grounds, restrictions on international banking transactions with Iran make it impossible to get medicine and medical supplies into the country, said Kamrava, also a professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar. In November, while Iran battled its third COVID wave, early payments for vaccines for the COVAX facility were stalled due to US financial sanctions. COVAX is a global initiative led by the WHO, which aims to ensure equitable access to COVID vaccines worldwide. Iran is one of the countries most severely affected by the pandemic, with nearly  million cases and more than , deaths. Of its  million people, around  percent have received at least one vaccine dose, according to Oxford Universitys online resource Our World in Data. In October, Iran received  million COVID vaccines from Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturer Sinopharm. That same month, child welfare agency UNICEF said Iran had received . million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines donated by Italy and Germany. Kamrava said the sanctions have been comprehensive, affecting every aspect of ordinary Iranians lives. US allies, especially in Europe, have been complicit in inflicting pain and suffering on the people of Iran. He said the zeal with which some entities in and outside the United States enforce sanctions on Iran, either out of fear, malice, or overcompliance, is astounding. The issue at hand seems to go beyond politics and verges on crimes against humanity, making a people badly in need of sanctions relief suffer needlessly, said Kamrava. Asif Shuja, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapores Middle East Institute, said for business entities dealing with Iran, the risks of not following US sanctions often outweigh the benefits. To save themselves from any crossfire, businesses often take extreme precautions and stop dealing with sanctioned countries. But the solution to this problem can be found in the moral domain, not in the legal domain, he said. Siddiqa said just as viruses do not know borders, there should be no disparity or barriers when it comes to the question of medical and humanitarian aid. The international community should ensure that medicine is affordable, and easily available as it is every humans right. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was reached between Iran and five UN Security Council members, including the United States, in July . The former US president, Donald Trump, withdrew the US from the accord in . While a potential resumption of nuclear talks could take place in November, it remains to be seen how successful they will be, Siddiqa said. janchinadailyapac.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
