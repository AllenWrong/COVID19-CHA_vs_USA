US President Donald Trump sought on Wednesday to downplay fears of the novel coronavirus threat in the United States, saying the risk remained very low and it was not inevitable that the virus would spread further in the country, which has reported  confirmed cases.  He appointed VicePresident Mike Pence to take charge of the US response to a contagion that has spread to about three dozen countries.  The risk to the American people remains very low, Trump, flanked by Pence and public health officials, told reporters in a packed briefing room at the White House.  I dont think its inevitable, Trump said of the spread of the virus, in apparent contradiction of officials of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who said a day earlier that the spread of the disease in the US was inevitable.  The Trump administration had requested . billion from Congress to fight the virus. Believing that the request was insufficient, some lawmakers have proposed more money for the effort.  Trump said he would accept whatevers appropriate.  Part of the funding will be earmarked to develop a vaccine for the virus, which health authorities said is at least a year away.  We cant rely on a vaccine over the next several months to a year, Andrew Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health, said at a briefing on Wednesday.  Trump said he had a long talk with President Xi Jinping recently.  He is working so hard on this problem, Trump said about Chinas efforts to contain the infection. He wants it to go away from China and go away fast, and he wants to get back to business as usual.  Trump added that China has a significant group of very talented people battling the outbreak.  International efforts to fight the outbreak include researching vaccines, conducting trials on existing treatments for other strains and supplying diagnostic tests and medical equipment. Britains GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, is to work with Chinabased Clover Biopharmaceuticals to help develop a vaccine candidate for novel coronavirus pneumonia, or COVID.  GSK will provide Clover with its pharmacological agent, or adjuvant, technology in the hope that the Chinese company could rapidly scale up and produce large quantities once a new coronavirus vaccine is available.  Clover claims to have one of the largest commercialscale biomanufacturing capabilities in China, while GSK is a leader in the development of innovative vaccines using adjuvant systems.  Steven Gong, vicepresident of business development and strategy at Clover, said Collaborations will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful new vaccine in times of emergency, and we continue to invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact us for this noble common cause.
