Cooperation in vaccine a triumph of globalization

The economic challenges of globalization have never been clearer than during the COVID pandemic. The IMF estimates that COVID has currently cost the world  trillion. So really COVID has been about striking balances, and all of these have potential implications for the economy and for globalizationfreedom versus protection, nationalism versus internationalism, science versus populism. From  plus candidates, we now finally have signals of vaccine efficacy for the prevention of infection or disease. At least three companies, Gamaleya, PfizerBioNTech and Moderna, all have vaccine efficacies above  percent at two months, and with safety information at two months. But what this tells us is an important proof of concept that a vaccine against COVID is possible. And also importantly for Moderna and PfizerBioNTech that an RNA vaccine against COVID, a first proof of concept for an RNA vaccine preventing an infectious disease. Weve managed to develop vaccines with unprecedented speed. Almost all of them received funding from the  billion program that the US government calls Operation Warp Speed, a program focused exclusively on the development of vaccines for the United States. The CEPIfunded vaccine is global, and CEPI the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations had . billion to give to COVID vaccine research and development. The COVAX facility is led by WHO, GAVIformerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation and CEPI, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations. And COVAX is really a mechanism now for the first time to grant access to innovative vaccine technology concurrently to lowand middleincome countries. Many Operation Warp Speed companies were also funded by CEPI, and thats an important point. And remember that CEPI funding comes from within international or global perspective on access and equity and on price. Truly, COVID vaccine research and development, and importantly, COVID vaccine manufacturing will be a global affair. Again, emphasizing how COVID has taken what we have had to do, manufacture  billion doses of vaccine, and made it a truly global effort. Another great example of COVID and globalization is the multilateralism that is a part of CEPI. In this case, a number of countries, organizations like European Union, and philanthropic organizations like the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, have put together funding to not only fund work on COVID, but also on the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Lassa virus, Chikungunya virus. Indeed, CEPI was the first out of the blocks. More than  countries have joined COVAX, which is organized by CEPI, GAVI and the World Health Organization. Its coordinated by GAVI under the ACT Accelerator activity that GAVI is responsible for. Ninetytwo lowand middleincome countries could be supported by the COVAX advanced manufacturing commitments and  billion doses of WTO prequalified vaccine will be available to all of the  countries that are part of COVAX by the end of .This represents roughly  percent of need. Theres work that needs to be done on continued surveillance. COVID has changed the way we look at the world and at each other, and hopefully the lessons learned from COVID in terms of globalization, in terms of the global economy, in terms of the rapidity of vaccine development when global efforts are put together, should be a reminder that we can do this, and that efforts like COVAX, which hope to ensure vaccine access and equity for people around the world are going to be the final triumph of globalization over COVID.
