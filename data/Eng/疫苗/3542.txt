PhotoXinhua    Since the establishment of the Forum on ChinaAfrica Cooperation  years ago and the recent initiation of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, China has become Africas biggest economic partner. There is no other country with such depth and breadth of engagement across trade, investment and infrastructure financing in Africa. In this context, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi underscored, on the occasion of the th anniversary of FOCAC on Nov , that trade between China and Africa had grown fold and hit . billion in . In addition, compared with  years ago, total Chinese foreign direct investment in Africa reached . billion in , which was fold growth. Furthermore, more than  billion in Chinese financial support was generated by . Chinas expanding investments were supported by the forums through promoting infrastructure development, encouraging Chinese enterprises to invest, and facilitating the development of small and mediumsized enterprises in Africa. The inflows of FDI from government and private enterprises facilitated the associated Chinese financial flows and enhanced the inclusive development potential of many African countries. China has already become a big financial source for Africas development endeavors. In September , a total of  billion in financing was pledged for Africa at the seventh FOCAC summit. This comprised  billion in grants, interestfree and concessional loans  billion in credit lines  billion for development finance  billion for financing imports from Africa and incentives for Chinese companies to invest at least  billion over three years. Undoubtedly, Chinese investments and external financing were indispensable to sustained economic growth in many African countries in the FOCAC period. Such investments have contributed to providing worldclass economic infrastructure, injected muchneeded capital, introduced new technologies and modern management knowhow, and strengthened management of project implementation in these economies. The views of African policymakers and academics demonstrate that countries significantly benefited from China during two decades of FOCAC. Chinas economic and foreign relations approach is generally perceived positively in African countries. Most observers emphasize Chinas diplomacy of noninterference, mutual respect and friendship with Africa as being fully appreciated by key decisionmakers. Current achievements are broadbased but tell only part of the story, since ChinaAfrica cooperation extends to other key sectors, as declared at the  FOCAC Beijing summit. The deepening relationship is beyond economic cooperation and extends to crucial social sectors as demonstrated by efforts to provide support for health and educational institutions and governance in African countries, and for peace and security missions in some states. More specifically, there is much to commend regarding Chinas efforts to assist Africa under the difficult circumstances of the COVID pandemic. The health and economic impacts of the pandemic are creating huge economic and social challenges globally. Chinas efforts to support Africa in surmounting these challenges and achieving postpandemic recovery are vital to ensuring that economic achievements in recent years are sustained, and poverty reduction in recent decades is not reversed. At such a critical moment in the global fight against the COVID pandemic, commitments made at the virtual Extraordinary ChinaAfrica Summit on Solidarity against COVID on June  promised to build a ChinaAfrica community of health for all. These commitments made at the summit in the words of President Xi Jinping included that African countries will be among the first to benefit from the COVID vaccine once its development and deployment are completed in China. The gains achieved under FOCAC and Belt and Road Initiative cooperation have evidently built a shared community and substantial collaboration in socioeconomic fields. The remaining matters are how to strengthen and enhance cooperation within FOCAC and the BRI on highpriority issues that improve peoples livelihoods and wellbeing. There are core areas of vital importance for the transformation of Africa that should be covered urgently, including poverty reduction in fragile economies, expanded efforts to develop Africas industrialization, and efforts to address the adverse impacts of climate change, which are an existential threat to some African regions and countries. The achievements of Chinas transformation to lift  million people out of poverty within a few decades are much aspired to globally. In addition, in view of Chinas success in addressing climate change, food security and agricultural productivity, the ways and means of collaborating in these critical areas should be set as priorities in extending the achievements under FOCAC and the BRI. The Chinese leadership has declared readiness to work with Africa on a framework of strategic cooperation on climate change to jointly tackle this challenge, as well as willingness to explore broader cooperation on clean energy. Over the past  years, FOCAC has considerably enhanced the cooperation and friendship of China and Africa, and the BRI will further strengthen this relationship. Current practices and ChinaAfrica strategic relations should be enhanced and expanded to critical areas that are vital for improving peoples lives and promoting sustainable development.
