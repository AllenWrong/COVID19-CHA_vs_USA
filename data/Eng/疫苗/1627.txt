Washingtons Cold War mindset leads G astray
2021-06-15 00:00
There has never been such a push to adopt a tougher approach to deal with China. Judging from the final communique of the G Summit in Cornwall, the United Kingdom, the first facetoface meeting of the G leaders was less about containing the novel coronavirus pandemic, combating climate change and boosting global economic recovery and more about targeting China based on the same old contrived charges of human rights abuses and forced labor in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. The Cornwall summit was supposed to be about reaffirming G solidarity following four years of damaging America first policies of Donald Trump, coordinating response to the pandemic, and adjusting to a postCOVID world, yet the communique, titled Our Shared Agenda for Global Action to Build Back Better released on Sunday, blames China and Russia for all the ills afflicting the developed world. Perhaps the group of developed countries is under the illusion that the world is led by its diktats. No wonder some of the G countries wanted the communique to declare a new Cold War. In particular, the United States would have preferred the communique to be sharper in its antiChina rhetoric, but the other members of the elite club saw reason in preventing a confrontational approach from becoming the Gs collective stance against China, for the moment at least.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
