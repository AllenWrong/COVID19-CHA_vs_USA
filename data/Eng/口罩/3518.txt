? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wearing a protective face mask, attends the weekly cabinet meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem, June , .  JERUSALEM  Israel started on Sunday preparations for building a new settlement in the Israelicontrolled Golan Heights named after US President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Cabinet ministers ratified a decision to establish the new settlement, named Ramat Trump in Hebrew, meaning Trump Heights, according to a statement released by the Prime Ministers Office. Today, we will begin practical steps in establishing the community of Ramat Trump on the Golan Heights, Netanyahu told the cabinet meeting. The new settlement will be located in the Golan, a disputed territory that Israel seized from Syria in the  Middle East war and has controlled ever since despite international criticism. Minister of Settlement Affairs Tzipi Hotovely, whose office was tasked with coordinating efforts to establish the new settlement, hailed the move as great news for the settlement activity in the Golan Heights. The ministry is starting to work to prepare the ground, she said in a statement, adding the settlement will be populated with an initial group of  settlers. The move comes weeks before Netanyahu plans to begin his controversial plan to annex the Jordan Valley, a portion of the Israelioccupied West Bank. Netanyahu set July  as the starting date for the beginning of the plan despite international condemnations. Trump recognized in March  Israels sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
