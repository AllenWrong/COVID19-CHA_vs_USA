HONG KONG  Washingtons stance on investigating the origins of COVID seems more about politics, in particular engaging China from a position of strength, said an opinion piece published in the South China Morning Post Tuesday. The article, entitled What does the United States really hope to achieve with its probe into coronavirus origins? was written by Gary Wong Chihim, a board member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong  Macao Studies. In late March, the World Health Organization WHO released a report on the global tracing of COVIDs origins, following a day joint study in Wuhan by  experts from the WHO and China. While the world was still digesting the findings from the first phase of the originstracing study, US President Joe Biden in May ordered the US intelligence community to produce a report on the origins of COVID within  days. The day investigation by the US intelligence community has a slim chance of producing anything meaningful. Worse, it could further distract from the WHOs course of study and hinder progress in pandemic control and prevention, said the article. They are unlikely to produce a definitive answer and few outside the United States will accept its conclusion because there is no independent corroboration, Wong Chihim cited what Foreign Affairs magazine wrote this month. The United States would be wise to decouple public health and geopolitics. It should reengage and build on the work the WHO has started and protect its citizens by learning from its pandemic failures, said his article.
