HONG KONG C Activist Joshua Wong Chifung was arrested on Thursday for allegedly participating in an unauthorized assembly and breaching the antimask law in October last year. He is expected to be produced before the court next Wednesday. While participating in the Oct  illegal assembly, Wong was also alleged to have breached the antimask law, which came into force the same day, prohibiting people from covering their faces during public gatheringsin a bid to stifle violent protests by masked mobs. That day, a large crowd gathered in Causeway Bay and marched towards Central before the assembly descended into violence and chaos and spread to  out of Hong Kongs  districts overnight. The radicals were seen hurling gasoline bombs, committing arson, blocking roads, attacking policemen and residents, and vandalizing shops and metro stations. Wong activist was arrested when he went to report to the Central Police District Headquarters Thursday in compliance with one of the bail conditions for another incitement charge he faces over the besieging of the police headquarters on June  last year. The activist now faces charges related to three separate incidents, including participation in an unauthorized assembly at Victoria Park on June .
