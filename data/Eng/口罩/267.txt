BEIJING  A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Friday condemned Taiwans Democratic Progressive Party DPP authority for its continuous provocations in seeking Taiwan independence. Such attempts will further undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and bring suffering to Taiwan compatriots, said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, when asked to comment on separatist remarks from Taiwans Tsai Ingwen. Stressing that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, Zhu noted that the nature of crossStrait relations is not statetostate relations, and no individual or force can change that fact.
