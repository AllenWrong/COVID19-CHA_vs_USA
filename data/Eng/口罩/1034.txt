JERUSALEM  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday night claimed victory in the countrys fourth elections in two years. The announcement came fewer than two hours after exit polls on Israels main three TV channels indicated no immediate winner in the unprecedented elections amid a prolonged political deadlock. A huge victory to the rightwing and the Likud party under my leadership, Netanyahu wrote on Twitter. He said his rightwing Likud party is by far the largest party in Israel, after the polls suggested it won about  seats. It is obvious that a clear majority of the citizens of Israel are rightwing and they want a stable and strong rightwing government that will take care of Israels economy and security, Netanyahu added. In a bid to form a government coalition, Netanyahu talked over the phone with leaders of three rightwing parties that already vowed to join a coalition under his leadership. Exit polls projected that they have won some  seats together. Naftali Bennet, leader of the prosettler Yamina party, said he also held a talk over the phone with Netanyahu. Polls projected Yamina won about seven seats. If Bennet, a former close ally of Netanyahu, will decide to join the longtime leaders coalition, they could form a coalition of  seats in the seat parliament.
