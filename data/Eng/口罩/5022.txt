FILE PHOTO Boxes of N protective masks for use by medical field personnel are seen at a New York State emergency operations incident command center during the coronavirus outbreak in New Rochelle, New York, US, March , .  Different recognition standards on medical supplies in different countries and regions should not block cooperation, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday. She made the remark in response to media reports that the US Food and Drug Administration refuses to allow KN masks into the country, which are mostly manufactured in China and considered an alternative to the N mask. Ive seen related reports, but Im not aware of the specific situation, she told reporters at a regular press conference in Beijing. If the media reports are true, she didnt know what are the considerations of the US side for making such decision. Masks are urgent materials for all countries given the current pandemic situation, Hua said, adding that China also has great domestic demand. Chinese companies are working around the clock to meet the demands at home and abroad, she said. The spokeswoman said that it is true that antiepidemic materials involve detailed issues, such as the different recognition standards in different countries and regions. But such issues should not become barriers for cooperation on antiepidemic materials, Hua said.
