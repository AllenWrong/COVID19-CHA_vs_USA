WASHINGTON  Over  percent of U.S. voters said they trust top U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci but not U.S. President Donald Trump when it comes to information on COVID, a new poll has found. According to the Quinnipiac University poll,  percent of voters do not trust information by Trump on COVID while  percent do. On the contrary,  percent say they trust Fauci while  percent distrust the information he offers. The poll came as the White House reportedly stepped up efforts to discredit Fauci. Among the attacks against him, presidential adviser Peter Navarro wrote in an oped published in USA Today on Tuesday that Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on. The attempt to discredit Faucis publichealth expertise is a political move, and one with disastrous implications, The Atlantic recently commented. The Americans who believe the White Houses antiscience campaign risk cutting themselves off from potentially lifesaving information.
