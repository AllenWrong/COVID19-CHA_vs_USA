US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden delivers remarks during a voter mobilization event, at Miramar Regional Park in Miramar, Florida, US, October , .  WASHINGTON  A third person tied to Joe Bidens campaign has tested positive for the coronavirus. The news comes as Bidens running mate, Kamala Harris, paused her inperson campaigning after finding out two others, one of her staffers and a crew member on her flight to Arizona last week, tested positive for the virus. Both Biden and Harris tested negative for the coronavirus Thursday morning. Biden campaign manager Jen OMalley Dillon said in a statement that an administrative staffer for the company that charters Bidens campaign plane tested positive on Thursday morning. The staffer flew with Biden to Ohio on Monday and Florida on Tuesday, but OMalley Dillon says they were always over  feet  meters away from Biden, and both wore masks for the entire flight. Because Biden was not in close contact with the person, the campaigns medical experts have advised that Biden doesnt need to quarantine. Agencies via Xinhua ?
