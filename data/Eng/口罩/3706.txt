JIN DINGCHINA DAILY June  is the International Childrens Day, and people everywhere have tried to make it a special day for their children. However, a safe, happy and prosperous society is the best gift they can have. Children on the Chinese mainland live in relative peace and harmony, especially at a time when terrorism and violence have reared their heads at many places. Protests against racism and police brutality have led to largescale violence in the United States. Although the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has seen rioting since June , the authorities there have shielded children from the violence. With China having controlled the spread of the novel coronavirus to a large extent, children in the country are also safer from the pandemic that continues to spread elsewhere in the world. Even with the situation largely under control, the authorities are not taking any chances, measuring peoples temperatures and asking them to wear masks at public places. Particularly, schools are taking utmost precaution. People need to just visit a primary or secondary school in China to realize how many procedures one has to clear before entering the premises. Basic education in China is among the best in the world and free. Even though China is a developing economy, children in the country enjoy the best facilities technology can provide, as the country is generous with its spending on basic education. Just a few months ago when the epidemic situation was grave in the country, the schools used livestreaming to enable children to attend classes from home. China has vowed to lift all residents out of poverty and build a moderately welloff society in all respects by the end of this year. Children will benefit the most as the living standards of people improve. Thats the kind of gift China is preparing for its children.
