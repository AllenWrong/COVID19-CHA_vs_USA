Beijing has enhanced market management and inspection amid the epidemic, securing relatively smooth operation of supermarkets and wet markets, a senior official said at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. Wang Hongcun, an inspector from the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau, said main markets and stores across the city are in good orders and the number of stores with goods out of stock fell to six on Tuesday from  on Sunday. To contain the further expansion of COVID, the city also suspended group events, such as wedding receptions and banquets. Onsite release conferences and fairs that would easily cause mass gatherings also are? suspended. Population flow is under strict management at business locations, he said. People are required to wear masks and receive body temperature checks and are also required to show their health code when entering these places.
