Fortyone trolleybuses equipped with an atomizing disinfection system for epidemic prevention have been put into use in Guangzhou, capital of South Chinas Guangdong province. The system, developed by a Guangzhou biotechnology company, allows automatic disinfection within just  minutes, after full coverage of atomizing disinfection liquid in  seconds inside the bus. The disinfection liquid is atomized and transmitted to the bus carriage. The atomized gas covers the object surfaces in the vehicle to form a protective film, which has an antibacterial effect of more than seven days, said Zhu Huiyu, chief technology officer of the Guangzhou Sanerqi Biotechnology Co Ltd. According to Zhu, the disinfection liquid used in the buses is a neutral disinfectant product, which is a longlasting physical antibacterial, nontoxic, noncorrosive and environmentally friendly. It can effectively kill more than  kinds of fungi, bacteria and viruses, Zhao said. Also, the trolleybuses are equipped with intelligent facilities to measure passengers body temperature and monitor whether masks are worn by passengers when they get on the buses, according to the Guangzhou Public Transport Group Trolleybus Co Ltd.
