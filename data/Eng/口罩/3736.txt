A man wearing a face mask holds a sign near a burning vehicle at the parking lot of a Target store during protests after a white police officer was caught on a bystanders video pressing his knee into the neck of AfricanAmerican man George Floyd, who later died at a hospital, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, May , .  WASHINGTON  The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN reporter reporting live on television early Friday morning while covering the Minneapolis protests, without giving any reason, and led him and three crew members away in handcuffs. Black reporter Omar Jimenez had just shown a protester being arrested when about half a dozen white police officers surrounded him. We can move back to where you like, he told the officers wearing gas masks and face shields, before explaining live on air that he and his crew were members of the press. Were getting out of your way. This is among the state patrol unit that was advancing up the street, seeing and scattering the protesters at that point for people to clear the area. And so we walked away, Jimenez said before being told he was under arrest and handcuffed by two officers. Why am I under arrest, sir? Thursday marked a third night of arson, looting and vandalism in Minnesota over the death of a black man, George Floyd, seen on video gasping for breath while a white police officer knelt on his neck. Governor Tim Walz had declared a state emergency and ordered the National Guard activated, and President Donald Trump suggested in a tweet that looters would be shot. Twitter accused him of breaking its rules by glorifying violence.  Agencies
