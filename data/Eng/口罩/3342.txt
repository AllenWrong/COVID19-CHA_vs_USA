A man looks at his phone as he walks in Times Square, wearing a mask during the coronavirus disease COVID outbreak, in New York City, the US.  UNITED NATIONS  The United Nations is rolling out a campaign to fight misinformation, particularly that on COVID, telling people who are about to retransmit social media content to pause, a senior UN official said on Monday. The idea of the initiative, Pause, is for people to take care before you share, said UndersecretaryGeneral Melissa Fleming, head of the UN Department of Global Communications. From the work of psychologists and misinformation experts on how misinformation is spreading, it is found that the way people share information plays a part, said Fleming. We hope that takecarebeforeyoushare starts to become a kind of social norm that people have in the back of their head and that will enable a personal behavior change that will help  Im just saying help  stop the spread of misinformation. She said the United Nations will work with social media platforms and technology companies to address the issue. Obviously, changing personal behavior does help. But its not enough. Misinformation is spreading like a virus. Its playing into peoples fears. Its creators are the masters of the platforms algorithms. The Pause initiative will be launched on Tuesday to coincide with Social Media Day. Fleming said it is appropriate to launch an initiative that is a bit of social distancing from social media.
