WASHINGTON  US Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said Friday that if elected, he will make COVID vaccines free for all Americans. Once we have a safe and effective vaccine, it has to be free to everyone  whether or not youre insured, Biden said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware.

The former vice president made the pledge one day after he debated Trump for the final time before the Nov.  election. The coronavirus pandemic was a central topic at the debate. COVID dwarfs anything that weve faced in recent history, and it isnt showing any signs of slowing down, said Biden, adding that the virus, which has now killed more than , people nationwide, is surging in almost every state. Were more than eight months into this crisis and the president still doesnt have a plan, said the yearold. He also laid out his pandemic response plan if elected, which includes consultation with governors of all the  states during the presidential transition period, a national mask mandate in all federal buildings and on all interstate transportation, and an increase in daily testing reaching seven times todays level. Trump, during the debate the previous night, boasted about a vaccine that is coming within weeks, only to backtrack when pressed by the moderator, saying his statement was not a guarantee.
