Costa cited relations with the European Union as the third highest priority of the government. Meanwhile, he said that Europe has lost time to respond to what is essential. We have to make a huge effort to approve, in July, the recovery fund proposed by the European Commission. It is absolutely vital and there are two ways. Either we all get out of the crisis together, or nobody is going to get out, he concluded.
