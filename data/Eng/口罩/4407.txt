In light of the COVID epidemic, the MODE  AutumnWinter apparel and accessories trade fair will feature a new online ordering system that aims to reduce contact between buyers and sellers. The event will take place at ShanghaiMart from April  to . According to Zhang Jie, project director of MODE, buyers simply need to scan a QR code provided by designers during the fair at ShanghaiMart to browse goods and place orders, hence reducing the time needed to perform a transaction in person. Brands can also automatically generate standardized electronic orders on the platform, eliminating the tedious form of traditional paper orders, says Zhang. Launched in , MODE is a trade fair for fashion buyers that features designers from more than  countries and regions. This year,  apparel brands will participate in the trade fair. Because of the epidemic, the organizer has taken special measures such as limiting visitor flows and requiring people to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. We specifically chose this period to hold MODE, says Zhang.If we held it any earlier, we might not have had enough time to prepare. If we held it any later, we might miss the ordering season and that wouldnt be good for the designers. Despite the availability of online ordering, The Timeless, a local brand that will attend the fair, still hopes to have facetoface communication with buyers so as to better understand the market situation. The online and offline synchronous trade fair is held in a timely and effective manner, which not only brings a new ordering mode but also solves the problem that customers could not be present during this special period, says Hu Chunhui, founder of HCH, a local buyers shop.
