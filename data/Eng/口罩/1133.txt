Gyms are highrisk venues for COVID transmission and people need to be wearing masks while there, researchers warned in two papers published on Wednesday in the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. One study described an August outbreak in a Chicago gym where  COVID cases were identified among  attendees of indoor highintensity exercise classes. Twentytwo  percent persons with COVID attended on or after the day symptoms began. Most attendees  percent wore masks infrequently, including persons with  percent and without COVID  percent, the authors reported. The other study reported on three gyms in Hawaii where  COVID cases in July were linked to two instructors who taught classes while infected. The rate of infection among students exposed before the instructors showed symptoms was  percent, the authors said. Gym attendees should wear masks, including during highintensity activities, even when they are  feet . m or more apart, the Chicago researchers said. Facilities should enforce physical distancing, improve ventilation, and encourage attendees to isolate after symptom onset, possible exposure to COVID, or a positive coronavirus test result. Exercising outdoors or virtually could further reduce SARSCoV transmission risk, they said. Agencies via Xinhua
