The setting was not the councils usual chamber in the UN headquarters but the Economic and Social Council conference roomaffording safe distancing for the  council members and the principal people on their teams. People wore masks except when they spoke into microphones. New York City entered phase four of its reopening on Monday without resuming additional indoor activities, as city officials are concerned about a potential second wave of coronavirus infections brought in from new hotspots across the United States.
