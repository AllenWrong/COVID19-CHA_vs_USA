Chinadeveloped telescope captures images of solar corona

KUNMING  Chinese scientists announced that they captured images of the suns hot, thin and outermost layer, called the corona, with a selfdeveloped telescopic instrument. Designed to block light from the main solar surface in order to observe the corona, the coronagraph, with a caliber of  mm, is positioned on a ,meterhigh mountain in Daocheng County of Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in southwest Chinas Sichuan Province. Before the invention of the coronagraph, scientists could observe the suns upper atmosphere only through the annual total solar eclipse, when the moons shadow covers the bright central layers of the sun and allows its dimmer corona to appear, said Lin Jun, head of the coronagraph project with the Yunan Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences CAS. A coronagraph mimics this natural phenomenon with a circular mask that sits inside a telescope to block the suns glaring light, Lin said. After years of site selection and construction of the instrument, scientists using the selfdeveloped coronagraph got a clear look at the solar corona on Feb. . The research team released one of the solar eclipselike images captured by the Chinese lightblocking instrument on social media earlier this month. It shows that China has mastered the key technologies of designing and manufacturing coronagraphs, Lin said. The instrument is a good start and can provide experience for the future development of a larger coronagraph, said CAS academician Fang Cheng. Scientists plan to mount the coronagraph on a balloon, floating  to  km from the ground, to observe and study the magnetic field structure and plasma distribution in the corona in August and September this year.
