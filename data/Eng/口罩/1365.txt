A former inmate, surnamed Guo, was sentenced to death for the crime of intentional injury by a Beijing intermediate peoples court. At about  pm on March , Guo quarreled with a yearold man surnamed Duan. Duan reminded Guo, who took his mask off when waiting to pay in a supermarket in the citys Dongcheng district, to wear the mask and abide by the rules for epidemic control, according to a statement from the Beijing Peoples Procuratorate. Guo was unhappy with Duan and hit Duans head and neck after pushing him on the ground. Duan was sent to a hospital, but died on March  from a head injury. Guo also injured two other staff members while trying to escape from the scene. Caixin media reported that Guo, a Beijing native, was sentenced to life in prison in February  for killing his girlfriend. About two years later, his sentence was cut to  years and then he frequently got commutations, it said.
