ROME  Researchers from the University of Milan have recently found that a woman in the northern Italian city was infected with COVID in November , according to media reports. Through two different techniques on skin tissue, the researchers identified in a biopsy of a yearold woman the presence of RNA gene sequences of the SARSCoV virus dating back to November , according to Italian regional daily newspaper LUnione Sarda. There are, in this pandemic, cases in which the only sign of COVID infection is that of a skin pathology, Raffaele Gianotti, who coordinated the research, was quoted by the newspaper as saying. I wondered if we could find evidence of SARSCoV in the skin of patients with only skin diseases before the officially recognized epidemic phase began, said Gianotti, adding we found the fingerprints of COVID in the skin tissue. Based on data in the world literature, this is the oldest evidence of the presence of the SARSCoV virus in a human being, said the report.
