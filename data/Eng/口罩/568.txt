A man wearing a mask walks in the Duomo square as Lombardy tightens restrictions due to a surge in the number of the coronavirus disease COVID infections in the region, in Milan, Italy, March , .  BEIJING  A World Health Organizationled team has found the novel coronavirus was circulating in China and elsewhere long before the outbreak at Wuhans Huanan seafood market in December  after studying the case of an Italian woman, the Daily Mail reported Tuesday. The yearold woman visited a Milan hospital complaining about a sore throat and skin lesions in November , a month before COVID would be identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan. She left behind a skin sample smaller than a dime. Two tests conducted more than six months later yielded traces of the novel coronavirus, according to research published in January by the British Journal of Dermatology. Scientists say further study of her case could help determine just how long the coronavirus was circulating before it was detected in Wuhan. Yet the womans identity is unknown, researchers say. Milans Policlinico hospital and the University of Milan, which oversaw her case, said they dont have her details. Raffaele Gianotti, the dermatologist who treated her, died in March, days before the WHOled team asked for more research regarding his patient, according to a report published in The Wall Street Journal on Monday. The team has recommended searching for possible COVID cases in other countries that predate the first confirmed Wuhan case.
