Hong Kong residents are beginning to show a degree of maskfatigue. After all, they have been wearing it like an appendage to their faces since Jan  when the citys first COVID case was reported. Its understandable after practicing three straight months of social distancing, some people are eager to reclaim their previral invasion lives. New cases are down to single digits. Incidences of community transmissions are next to nil. Which is to say nothing of the fact that the sun is out after weeks of gloomy, wet weather. So at a time when much of the worlds population remains under lockdown, Hong Kong residents are spilling out on the streets. To be fair, a vast majority of them continue to wear masks and maintain hand hygiene even when they are out and about. It might be worth remembering that the second wave of the Spanish Flu in  was far deadlier than the first, and largely because it was not expected to return. Perhaps it makes better sense to take a cue from the local government which extended its regulations on socializing until May , and keep those masks on for the time being. basuchinadailyhk.com A couple finds a camping spot in a corner of the West Kowloon Cultural District.?Calvin Ng  China Daily The rolling greens of West Kowloon Cultural District saw a number of visitors last weekend.?Calvin Ng  China Daily ?
