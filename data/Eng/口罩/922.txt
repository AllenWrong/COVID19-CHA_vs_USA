The work to build an uninterrupted harborfront from Kennedy Town to Aldrich Bay and beyond in the Eastern district  covering a span of . kilometers  has been progressing at a steady pace, all this while. If you have not been to the Belcher Bay or Wan Chai promenades in the last few months, chances are that you will have a big smile of utter delight under your face mask when you go there the next time, for the regenerated sections of the harborfront have turned into a favorite haunt of small children. Its a heartwarming sight to watch the tiny tots skipping down lowrise, wide wooden steps on the promenade, climbing on to and inside playground installations and checking out sculptures of prehistoric creatures, while their slightly older peers spend time hanging out around sculptures of their favorite animated characters at the AniCom Park in Wan Chai.
