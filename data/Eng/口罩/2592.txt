PARKER ZHENG  CHINA DAILY HONG KONG  Hong Kongs Education Bureau EDB on Monday announced a twophase resumption of facetoface classes by the end of September. Schools will initially have only halfday classes. Education Secretary Kevin Yeung Yunhung announced in a press conference that first, fifth and sixth grades of local secondary and primary schools and upper kindergarten grades will resume onsite classes on Sept . The remaining, including the second through the fourth grades of secondary and primary schools, as well as lower kindergarten grades, will resume classes on Sept . Schools shall conduct halfday classes so as to be done for the day before lunchtime. Students will need to take off masks during lunchtime which comes with risks of infection and EDB is trying to avoid that. International schools and special schools are required to generally follow the timetable with proper adjustment according to the situation on the ground. Arrangements for crossborder students have not yet been decided, said Yeung. EDB also reminded teachers, staff, and students to wear face masks, maintain personal hygiene, and take regular temperature while on the campus. The government will distribute child masks to families in need, said Yeung. The resumption of classes follows a closure of over more than months as the city battled a fierce resurgence of infection. Authorities imposed strict social distancing measures, including an early summer holiday for schools that started on July , to contain the surge in cases.
