Research is being conducted, but currently the effect of the coronavirus remains uncertain, said Qiao Jie, president of Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing, during a video conference arranged by the Chinese embassy in Singapore on Tuesday. We hope to have deeper research to understand the impact the COVID on the reproductive systems of men and women, she said. Research so far has been small scale during the epidemic due to the risk associated with samples, so evidence is not solid yet, Qiao said.
