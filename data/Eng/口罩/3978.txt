Medical staff work in the isolation ward at Wuhan No. Hospital in Wuhan, Central Chinas Hubei province, Feb , .  The Ministry of Civil Affairs on Thursday asked charities to redeploy donated face masks and other supplies across regions based on epidemiccontrol needs and warned against hoarding or reselling such supplies. In a circular on its website, the ministry said the move was aimed at making the most of public donations to contain the novel coronavirus outbreak. Many public donations were mainly directed to Central Chinas Hubei province C an early coronavirus hot spot. As domestic infections have abated in recent months, some border cities are facing growing pressure to fight imported cases. The circular said charities can end fundraising activities earlier in light of local conditions and relocate surplus supplies to places in need if they can get consent from donors. Donated materials also can be used to as gifts to frontline workers and impoverished households. The ministry asked local civil affairs authorities to track the flow of donations to rule out embezzlement, and noted it is forbidden for charities to draw operational fees from donated funds. The ministry said charities can ask recipients to correct their deeds or return donations if they failed to use the money or supplies in prescribed ways. Charities also should produce certificates or receipts to donors as soon as possible. The ministry encouraged charities to roll out programs that help restart social lives, fight imported cases, care for impoverished households and show support to those who lost family members to the epidemic.
