Shanghais air quality is likely to suffer from high levels of PM  particles less than  micrometers in diameter  on Tuesday as air masses have carried dust and sand particles above the sea in the northeast toward the city, local authorities announced. According to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Ecology and Environment, the weather condition is also due to a decrease in the precipitation levels in the city which started on Monday night. Authorities expect the situation to improve by Tuesday evening due to winds and rain. The bureau has reminded residents, especially the elderly, children, pregnant women and people with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, to stay indoors. Protective measures such as wearing masks should be taken when going outside.
