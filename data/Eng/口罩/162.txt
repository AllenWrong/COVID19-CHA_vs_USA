Photo by Bruce Connollychinadaily.com.cn The recent sevenday National Day holiday, which saw many visitors coming to Beijing, was also a time for locals to go out to shop, dine or just enjoy the many attractions of their city. For photographer Bruce Connolly, it was a time to be out with a camera, for there are so many moments to capture through the lens. His outings took him to Sanlitun Taikooli, a very popular lifestyle area that attracts many younger people, as well as the historic Wangfujing Street, a mustsee area for domestic tourists in particular. With my camera I simply want to record everyday life in Beijing, the scenes of the city I appreciate and have a deep affection for. Many people arriving at Taikooli Sanlitun in Beijing, Oct , .
