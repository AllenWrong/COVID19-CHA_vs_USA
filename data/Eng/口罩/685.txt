WASHINGTON  The United States has seen an increase in COVID adolescent hospitalization rates in April, according to a report released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC on Friday. Most COVIDassociated hospitalizations occur in older adults, but severe disease that requires hospitalization occurs in all age groups, including adolescents aged  to  years. The CDC examined COVIDassociated hospitalizations among adolescents aged  to  years, including demographic and clinical characteristics of adolescents admitted during Jan  to March , and hospitalization rates among adolescents during March and April. COVID adolescent hospitalization rates peaked at . per , in early January , declined to . in midMarch, and rose to . in April, according to CDC data. Among hospitalized adolescents, nearly one third required intensive care unit admission, and  percent required invasive mechanical ventilation. No associated deaths occurred. Recent increased hospitalization rates in spring and potential for severe disease reinforce the importance of continued COVID prevention measures, including vaccination and correct and consistent mask wearing among persons not fully vaccinated or when required, the CDC said in a report. I am deeply concerned by the numbers of hospitalized adolescents and saddened to see the number of adolescents who required treatment in intensive care units or mechanical ventilation, said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky in a statement. Until they are fully vaccinated, adolescents should continue to wear masks and take precautions when around others who are not vaccinated to protect themselves, and their family, friends, and community, Walensky said.
