The first batch of  Chinese construction staff members who will start work at a mining project in Guyana, recently arrived on a charter plane and went to its Aurora mining project department, after completing isolation and observation procedures. The staff members are from the mining project contractor Sinohydro Bureau  Co, a subsidiary of POWERCHINA. Their arrival has provided a solid guarantee for fully promoting the resumption of work and production of the project and achieving the goal of reaching and exceeding production. The first batch of  construction workers from Sinohydro Bureau  Co arrives in Guyana.  The Guyana Aurora mining project is located in the Amazon rainforest in South America, about  kilometers west of Guyanas capital Georgetown. It is estimated that the total amount of mining and stripping of the project will reach  million metric tons a year. With a contract period of five years, the project construction includes rock drilling, blasting, transportation, dumping and road maintenance. Affected by the COVID epidemic, to date the construction progress has stagnated. Sinohydro Bureau  Co appointed capable management and construction personnel and completed deployment of personnel, involving passports and visa processing, vaccination injections and chartering the plane. The company also purchased a large number of antiepidemic materials  such as masks, protective clothing, gloves and goggles, and organized for construction workers to conduct epidemic prevention knowledge training, nucleic acid testing and temperature testing. The Guyana Aurora mining project is the first mining project undertaken by Sinohydro Bureau  Co in South America. It will lay a solid foundation for the establishment of POWERCHINAs mining construction brand in South America and further its development in the international market. ?
