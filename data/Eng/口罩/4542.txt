SAN FRANCISCO  Governor Jay Inslee of Washington said Friday that President Donald Trumps calls for liberating parts of the country are dangerous. ? New York Police officers wear protective masks as they keep an eye on demonstrators who protest against U.S. President Donald Trump and his policies outside Trump International Hotel during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease COVID in New York, US, April , .  He is putting millions of people in danger of contracting COVID. His unhinged rantings and calls for people to liberate states could also lead to violence. Weve seen it before, Inslee said in a statement. His words are likely to cause COVID infections to spike in places where social distancing is working, the statement said. I hope political leaders of all sorts will speak out firmly against the presidents calls for rebellion. Americans need to work together to protect each other. Its the only way to slow the spread of this deadly virus and get us on the road to recovery, Inslee concluded. In a series of tweets Friday morning, Trump urged liberating Virginia, Minnesota and Michigan, three political swing states that now have Democratic governors, throwing his support behind protesters opposing restrictive measures imposed there to slow the spread of COVID.
