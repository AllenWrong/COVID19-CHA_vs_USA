Pedestrian wear face masks on a street in the center of Amsterdam, The Netherlands on June , .  THE HAGUE  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced on Tuesday that wearing a face mask will be mandatory again in public indoor places. The announcement came amid rising COVID infections over the past few weeks. Rutte told a press conference here that face mask use will now apply to all publicly accessible indoor spaces, including libraries, town halls, supermarkets, shops, train stations and parts of hospitals and universities. The requirement of a corona pass that has been mandatory for access to restaurants, cafes, theaters and stadiums, will be extended to museums, zoos, amusement parks, gyms, swimming pools, terraces and sports events outside and indoors. The corona pass can be a negative COVID test result, a proof of vaccination or a proof of recovery. The new measures will come into effect on Saturday. Once again a difficult message, now that the infection figures and hospital admissions are increasing, Rutte said. It remains difficult because everything about corona leads to more and more discussion in society.
