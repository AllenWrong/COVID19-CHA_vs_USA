OTTAWA  Canada announced Friday afternoon to extend the current ban on most international travelers another month to Sept  to stem the spread of COVID. Our government is extending the existing restrictions on international travel to Canada by one month  until Sept ,   to limit the introduction and spread of COVID in our communities, said Canadian Public Safety Minister Bill Blair in a tweet. Canada implemented a series of measures against the COVID pandemic, including the restrictions on entry to all travelers who are not Canadian citizens and permanent residents, to stem the spread of COVID in March. The restrictions, which were first put in place in late March for a day period and extended since every month, prohibit all nonessential or discretionary travel to Canada from countries other than the United States. This includes any leisure travel, such as vacation and entertainment travel, for nonCanadian citizens or permanent residents. Canadians who choose to travel abroad, including to the United States, will be required to selfisolate upon their return. Essential workers, including healthcare professionals, airline crews and commercial truckers, will continue to be exempt from quarantine measures. Some immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents will be also allowed to enter Canada by air if exempt. Fridays announcement does not affect the CanadaUS border, which remains closed to all nonessential travel until Sept .
