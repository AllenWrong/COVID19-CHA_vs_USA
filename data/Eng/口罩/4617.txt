On  April, Beijing reported one new imported confirmed case of COVID. The patient tested negative in the nucleic acid testing at the quarantine station, but came down with a fever and became a confirmed case two days after being released from quarantine. Head of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control cautioned that although there have been few local infections in Beijing, there are sporadic cases caused by imported cases and high risks of catching the disease still remain. All city residents must continue to maintain safe social distance, wear masks and take other selfprotection measures.
