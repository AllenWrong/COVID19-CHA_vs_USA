LOS ANGELES  All bars in Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the United States with a population of over  million, were ordered to shut down again due to the rising number of COVID cases. Seven counties in the state, including Los Angeles, must close their bars and eight more counties are recommended to do so, according to a mandate issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom on Sunday. NEW Due to the rising spread of COVID, CA is ordering bars to close in Fresno, Imperial, Kern, Kings, Los Angeles, San Joaquin, and Tulare, while recommending they close in Contra Costa, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Stanislaus,  Ventura, Newsom tweeted. The governor released a statement later, saying it was a critical step to limit the spread of the virus as the counties were seeing the biggest increases of infections after the economy reopened. The statement noted that public health professionals within California and throughout the nation had identified bars as the highest risk sector of nonessential business currently open because consumers hardly maintain social distance in bars and patients are hard to trace. Newsom previously banned all bars and restaurants in California to open in midMarch at the early stages of the COVID pandemic, a ban which was lifted last weekend. Los Angeles County officials have reported significant increases in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and positive test results in recent days.
