A sign asks people to wear a face mask in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg on Oct ,  in New York City.  WASHINGTON  The US peoples distrust of the government and their deep conviction that disasters are things happening to others have resulted in the countrys current predicament amid the pandemic, said an opinion piece published recently by the US magazine Foreign Policy. The article, titled Why the United States Cant Defeat the Coronavirus, pointed out that for too many Americans, disasters are things that happen to other people, never themselves. It noted that since the outbreak of the epidemic, many Americans hold the belief that This cant really be happening, a denial of reality. By quoting what South Dakota nurse Jodi Doering told CNN, the article said People are still looking for something else, and they want a magic answer, and they dont want to believe that COVID is real ... Their last dying words are, This cant be happening. Its not real. Considering the fact that government departments are underfunded, the article said Americans everyday experience with government services is bureaucratic, oppressive, and unpleasant. From crumbling infrastructure to a tax system and a carceral state that target the poor, Americans have ample reason to not trust the government to do its job, it said. Moreover, the article analyzed that the United States never really imposed a lockdown and the country has not carried out a centralized testandtrace program, which is necessary to spot and stamp out possible outbreaks. Key among these has been a centralized and mandatory system for quarantine and isolation, not just for patients themselves but for those exposed to them, it pointed out. It was this step that crushed the spread of the virus in China and has helped contain it elsewhere, it added.
