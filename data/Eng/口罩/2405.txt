The warning, issued by the Education Steering Committee of the State Council, Chinas Cabinet, said related departments should coordinate to strengthen management around schools, resolve disputes happening near campus involving students, and prevent students from becoming victims of violence. This is the fifth warning that has been issued by education authorities since the beginning of the year. The committee said the warning was issued as violent incidents in which students were injured have recently been reported in provinces like Guangdong and Hunan. The committee also requested schools at all levels to offer emergency training and drills to students, and called on parents to cooperate with schools to ensure students safety on their way between school and home. Education departments will work with local public security authorities to check whether schools have hired security guards, installed surveillance cameras and the press the button and report to the police system. Any school leaders whose neglect of campus security leads to accidents will be held accountable, the committee said in the warning.
