Many Chinese doctors are working with our local doctors in many health institutions under the already existing bilateral framework and without any doubt, this new challenge will create new avenues of expanding the scope of cooperation programs which could include preventing and controlling of emerging and reemerging communicable diseases like COVID, Winnie Chibesakunda, Zambias ambassador to China, told China Daily in a written interview. Chibesakunda said that despite its domestic challenges, China has shown global leadership and demonstrated a strong resolve to assist countries in fighting the spread of the contagion by sending medical supplies and technical teams to various countries, both developed and developing. According to her, both Chinese Stateowned enterprises and private companies have voluntarily assisted Zambia. For example, the country has benefitted from the Jack Ma Foundations donation of COVID test kits, protective equipment for frontline staff, masks and thermal guns, among others. Given the capacity challenges faced by many African countries weak health systems, the timely assistance by China will help save lives and give time to African governments to build domestic capacity to deal with the crisis, she said. Chibesakunda noted that what is needed now is for all African governments to seriously consider investing in the health sector by building more hospitals and focusing on research and development. We thank the Chinese government because under the Forum on ChinaAfrica Cooperation, flagship projects such as the headquarters of the African Center for Disease Control and Prevention and ChinaAfrica Friendship Hospitals were considered, she said.
