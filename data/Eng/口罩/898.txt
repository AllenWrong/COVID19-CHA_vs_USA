Taiwans Democratic Progressive Party and independence separatists were warned on Monday by a senior official not to misjudge the situation. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Councils Taiwan Affairs Office, was responding to Taiwan leader Tsai Ingwens provocative remarks at a conference on Sunday that DPP authorities will make Taiwan a normalized country. Ma said DPP authorities had manipulated, played up and spread Taiwan independence, further exposing their hypocrisy and tearing off their mask of easing crossStraits relations. He said there is only one China and Taiwan is a part of China and will never split from the country. Issues concerning Chinas sovereignty and territorial integrity must be decided by all Chinese people. The DPPs ugly show proves that provoking independence is the biggest destabilizing factor of peace and stability across the Straits and a cancer that threatens the interests and wellbeing of Taiwan compatriots, Ma said. This fully demonstrates that our resolute efforts to curb and combat Taiwan secessionist activities are to safeguard peace and stability across the Straits as well as the common interests of our compatriots on both sides, he said. He noted that the future of Taiwan and the wellbeing of Taiwan people both lie in national reunification, which is a trend that no individual or power can change. Those who stubbornly cling to their illusions about Taiwans independence, build themselves up by relying on foreign powers and seeking to provoke independence will eventually suffer a shameful defeat and be judged by history, he added.
