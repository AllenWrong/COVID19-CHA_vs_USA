WASHINGTON  Two White House executive offices closed their cafeterias on Wednesday after an employee tested positive for COVID. The eatery of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, known as the Ikes Eatery, and the cafeteria of the New Executive Office Building NEOB have been temporarily closed, according to an email to staff of the Executive Office of the President EOP, which was obtained by media outlets. Both buildings are close to the White House. The Eisenhower Executive Office Building is located next to the West Wing, and houses a majority of offices for White House staff. As a result of proper safety protocols in place for food service staff, which include masks, gloves, plastic shielding at checkout, and the discontinuation of community service vessels, as risk of retransmission to anyone who may have frequented Ikes Eatery or the NEOB Cafeteria remains very low, read the email. The White House Medical Unit has already conducted contact tracing and based off of their interviews, they have determined that no EOP staff should selfquarantine due to exposure, it said.

The White House recently ended regular temperature checks for all those entering the White House complex but those who will come into close contact with Trump also should be given still given rapid tests.
