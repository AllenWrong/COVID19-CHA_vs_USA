Its a milestone for the war against the COVID, but weve clearly recognized that there are still possible risks, while removing the lockdown doesnt mean well loosen control and prevention work, said Cao Guangjing, the provinces vicegovernor, at a news conference in Wuhan. Starting Wednesday, train services and domestic flights departing Wuhan, as well as passenger liners except for cruises, resumed. The government will coordinate and organize transportation of people with green health codes to leave Wuhan in good order, he said. But its advised that people reduce outdoor activities or going out of the city, except for necessary trips, he said. Also, control measures for communities will remain strict, including checking visitors identity and body temperature and reminding them to wear masks. The war against COVID is yet to finish so we have to remain calm and alert, he said. The province also will strictly examine the issue of the green health code, without which nobody can travel in the city or get out the city, he said. He said that the province also is making efforts to push forward the mutual recognition of health codes with its neighboring provinces to facilitate population flow.
