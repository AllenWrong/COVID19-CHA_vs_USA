KUALA LUMPUR  AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation APEC members should lift export bans and other barriers to trade involving medical goods to support the fight against COVID, said an expert with APEC. Dr. Denis Hew, director of the APEC Public Support Unit, stressed in an article sent to Xinhua that in facing the pandemic, the flow of medical goods was especially important. COVID is a multifaceted global pandemic that has impacted the health and safety of billions and has longterm economic and social effects. This moment offers an opportunity for APEC economies to relook trade policy response to ensure that it supports health systems across the region. Hew suggested APEC economies could commit to refrain from implementing trade restrictive measures on these products even after the pandemic abates and maintain open supply lines. Hew said APEC represents . percent . billion of the global import value of these essential medical goods, and . percent . billion of global exports. More importantly, APEC economies occupy many of the top spots on the lists of importers and exporters of these items, he said. It may now be an opportune time for economies to consider the elimination or reduction of tariffs on these lifesaving products. These products include face masks, hand soap, sanitizers and other personal protective equipment, he said. Such a timely and lifesaving trade liberalization initiative would send a positive signal to the rest of the world and contribute in steering the global response to the pandemic in the right direction, he concluded.
