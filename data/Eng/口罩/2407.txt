Looks like we are almost back to normal. Gyms and swimming pools have reopened. Schools are about to. Bars are serving customers until midnight. Earlier in September, Hong Kong Food and Health Secretary Sophia Chan Siuchee announced that the novel coronavirus situation in the city had stabilized. Like the local government, Hong Kong people have accepted that while stray COVID cases are likely to emerge from time to time, a largescale wave of infections has been stalled, for the time being. The governments twoweeklong mass testing program detected  cases from screening . million, putting the infection rate at . percent. The credit for being able to rein in a virus still infecting vast swathes of people every day in other parts of the world belongs largely to Hong Kong residents, who have been meticulously practicing hand hygiene and keeping their masks on since the citys first coronavirus case was reported on Jan . Now as Hong Kong people go about taking a walk in the park, visiting beauty salons or attending a friends birthday party, the mask stays on the face. Even the most absentminded who might miss combing their hair before stepping out of the house are unlikely to forget the mask. Even if it werent mandated by the local government, Hong Kong residents will probably continue to wear a face mask, until most people are vaccinated and the Department of Health confirms that it is safe to pull down the coverings that have become an extension of our faces these last few months. When that day arrives  and arrive it surely will, probably as unexpectedly and suddenly as COVID did  it will probably feel a tad unnatural being seen in public without a mask and our faces exposed. basuchinadailyhk.com Lunchtime crowd in a restaurant in Tseung Kwan O.
