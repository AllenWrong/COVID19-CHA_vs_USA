A new survey in the US found that  percent of Americans believe wearing a mask in nearly all public areas would be effective in reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus, Fox News reported. According to the report, large majorities of Americans  eight in   approve of their state or local government enacting such requirements. Seven in ten Americans think the worst of the virus is yet to come, twothirds report infections are increasing in their state, and more than three in five are highly concerned that someone in their family will contract the virus. The case for wearing a mask is persuasive. Americans see that a mask can be a powerful tool in getting back to some sense of normal  by reopening the schools, workplaces, etc. Wearing a mask shows decency and respect and caring for everyone, particularly those who are ill, elderly or most at risk, the report says. Fox News said although traditional acts of compassion that promote the healing touch of human interaction are not available when people are advised to be socially distant, everyone can show their compassion for others by wearing a mask. The report also said by taking action together to wear masks, Americans can bring the virus to its knees and get back to normal life more quickly.
