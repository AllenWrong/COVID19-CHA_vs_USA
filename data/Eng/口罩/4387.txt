Teachers and students will each be provided with one face mask every day when schools start to reopen since April , Lu Jing, director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission, said at a news conference held by the municipal government on Friday. Lu added that all schools are required to disinfect key areas such as the canteens, dormitories, selfstudy classrooms and toilets every day. Hand sanitizers and masks are required in classrooms and all extracurricular activity are prohibited. In addition, schools must designate isolated places within their premises for emergency observation. In terms of screening, people entering the school must have their temperature taken as well as display their personal health QR code. Schools with more than  teachers and students must install thermal imaging devices at their entrances. We also hope that parents will pay more attention to their childrens health. If the kids develop a fever and other ailments, they should promptly be sent to the hospital and return to school only after they have recovered, Lu said. According to Yun Minxia, director of the Education Commission at Minhang district, the commission has coordinated with several schools to have their teaching staff undergo nucleic acid testing.
