The supplies came from the Chinese Consulate General in Chicago. The volunteers spent hours making , health kits, each with different items. The first batch went to teenage Chinese students. Some of them are far from their parents, and there will be no commencement for them this academic year. Hope the health kit from the motherland will give them some comfort and help, He said. The distribution of the health kits lasted for three days. Many students who have received a health kit posted pictures of it through WeChat. A girl wrote, Spring has come. Flowers are blossoming.
