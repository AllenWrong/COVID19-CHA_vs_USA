Customs workers check an inbound passengers health information card in Shenzhen, South Chinas Guangdong province, on April , .  There is little possibility of a major new outbreak of COVID in China, even though cases of imported infections have been reported, according to Zhong Nanshan, a prominent respiratory disease expert. Chinas efforts to prevent and control the novel coronavirus have been already taken effect in residential communities, with peoples awareness of selfprotection against the disease being strengthened, Zhong said. Once a person notices a symptom, such as fever, it will soon be reported to the health authorities for further diagnosis and then isolation if coronavirus is confirmed, he said. Generally, there will be a risk of spreading the disease in residential communities. But chances of a second big outbreak in China remain slim, he said. In an interview with Peoples Daily on Sunday, Zhong said the risk of transmission of imported cases from abroad definitely exists  even in cases where no symptoms are present. They are highly infectious and will transmit the virus, he said. As of Sunday, Guangdong province had reported  imported cases of infections of COVID, according to the local health commission. Zhong said Chinas experience in prevention and control of the disease might be duplicated in countries that are now being hit by the COVID pandemic. Chinas efforts  including lockdowns and a collective response for prevention and control of the disease in communities  should be promoted, Zhong said. Wearing face masks is still of great importance to prevention and control of the coronavirus, he added. It is not a right time to throw away the masks, given that a number of countries and regions are still being hit hard, and there will a high rate of humantohuman infections.
