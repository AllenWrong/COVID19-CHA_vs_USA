US assistant secretary of health Brett Giroir.  WASHINGTON  Brett Giroir, US assistant secretary of health, warned Wednesday of local governments draconian measures if the public do not take safety precautions seriously. Giroir said in an interview on NBCs TODAY show that the nation is at critical point in the response to the pandemic, noting we can still control the virus by observing social distancing, wearing masks and being cautious about small indoor gatherings. If Americans do not follow those measures, he warned, it may force local officials or government officials in the states to have more draconian measures because cases will go up if we dont make a change. The official refuted President Donald Trumps repeated claims that growing testing is the reason for surging cases, but rather the widespread infections. He also called on the country to bolster testing capacity to conduct more tests. The United States averaged more than , cases per day over the past week, bringing the nationwide count to over ,,, according to data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, directorgeneral of the World Health Organization, urged efforts earlier this week to stop the politicization of COVID. Where there has been political division at the national level where there has been blatant disrespect for science and health professionals, confusion has spread and cases and deaths have mounted, he added.
