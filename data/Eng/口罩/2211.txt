WASHINGTON  US Democratic presidential nominee Joe Bidens town hall on ABC drew . million viewers on Thursday night, surpassing the Nielsen ratings for President Donald Trumps town hall on NBC, according to data from Nielsen Media Research on Friday. Trumps event, aired across NBC and its sibling cable channels of MSNBC and CNBC in the same hour, drew . million viewers altogether. It was a result virtually no one in the TV business expected, said a CNN report. Before the competing town halls, it had been widely expected that Trump would score a higher Nielsen rating, an estimate of the total number of viewers for a particular television program, than the former vice president since Bidens town hall only aired on ABC but the presidents also appeared on NBCs sibling cable channels. Nielsens ratings include viewership on broadcast and cable channels that aired each town hall ABC for Biden and NBC, MSNBC and CNBC for Trump, as well as viewership of those channels on internetconnected TVs and outofhome viewership viewership at bars, restaurants, etc. The Nielsen ratings only measure viewership on TV sets. Both town halls were livestreamed to phones, computers and other devices. Trump and Biden were originally scheduled to face off on Thursday in Miami at the nowcanceled second presidential debate. The Commission on Presidential Debates decided to stage the event virtually after Trump tested positive for COVID on Oct  but rejected the arrangement. A final presidential debate is still scheduled for Oct  in Nashville in the southern US state of Tennessee.
