NEW YORK  Walmart will require shoppers to wear face masks starting next week, the US retail giant announced Wednesday, joining an increasing number of businesses in mandating the protection amid the latest spike in coronavirus cases. The move by the worlds biggest retailer, which had previously only encouraged consumers to use face coverings, adds to the momentum in favor of an item broadly embraced in many countries but which has become a cultural flashpoint in the United States in the struggle with COVID. Walmart said masks are critically important and the requirement will take effect July , which will give the company time to post signage and train health ambassadors to facilitate the new policy. The company has more than , Walmart and Sams Club stores in the United States and is a giant retail presence in many of the southern and western states that have seen increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks. The US death toll from the virus stood at , Wednesday, but the country should hit , by August , according to an average of models of  research groups in the United States and elsewhere. Some of the models estimate the deathtoll will rise above , by November. On Wednesday, Alabama became the latest state to require face masks, joining California, Texas and local governments that have mandated the coverings in recent days. The group does not include Oklahoma, another state with spiking cases. Republican Governor Kevin Stitt confirmed Wednesday he tested positive for the virus, but said he would not impose a mandate out of concerns about individual freedom, according to news reports. AFP
