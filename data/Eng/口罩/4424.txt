GENEVA  The Swiss federal government on Wednesday said it will guarantee the supply of face masks as parts of the current lockdown measures are expected to be eased next week. Swiss Federal Councilor and Defence Minister Viola Amherd told a press conference Wednesday that the Swiss armed forces are planning on buying up to over  million face masks, which will be sold to retailers at purchasing price. The official said that some  million face masks have already been distributed among Switzerlands  cantons. Despite the efforts to guarantee the supply, the Swiss government will not make it a general obligation to wear a mask, said Alain Berset, head of the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs. A mask does not replace the basic rules like distance and hand hygiene, he said. However, the government has recommended that passengers using public transport in rush hours wear protective masks. According to a survey published by local media earlier this week, threefifths of the respondents in Switzerland said they are in favor of the mandatory wearing of protective masks in public to fight COVID. Switzerland reported  new cases of COVID on Wednesday, bringing the total infections to ,, with , fatalities.
