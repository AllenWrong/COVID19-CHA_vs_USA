LONDON  The United Kingdoms novel coronavirus outbreak is starting to peak but it is too early to lift the lockdown because the virus would run rampant if the government eased social distancing measures, health minister Matt Hancock said on Thursday. The United Kingdom has the fifth highest official death toll from COVID in the world, after the United States, Italy, Spain and France, though the figure only covers hospital fatalities and the real number is probably much higher. We think it is too early to make a change, Hancock said. While weve seen a flattening of the number of cases, and thankfully a flattening of the number of deaths, that hasnt started to come down yet. If we just released all the measures now, then this virus would run rampant once again and we cant let that happen. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson recuperates at a country residence from COVID complications that nearly cost him his life, the British government is due to discuss a review of the lockdown later on Thursday. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, has already made clear there will be no immediate lifting of the social distancing measures announced on March . Raab will chair a cabinet meeting at  GMT at which the governments chief scientist will update ministers. Later in the afternoon Raab will chair an emergency response meeting to discuss the lockdown. The United Kingdoms hospital death toll from COVID rose by  to , as of  on April , the health ministry said. Broader statistics that include deaths in care homes and in the community suggest the total toll is much larger. Reuters
