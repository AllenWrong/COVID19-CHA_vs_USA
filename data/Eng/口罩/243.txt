A total of  people involved in the outbreak of COVID in Jingzhou, Hubei province, in July, were punished for failing in their duty of prevention and control of the spread of the virus, local authorities said. That included those who were in charge of the Jingzhou Railway Station, where a construction worker was in contact with a tour group from Huaian, Jiangsu province, and was infected. The infection then spread to Wuhan, Hubei. Li Gang, Party secretary of the station, and Fu Sanhe, head of the station, received disciplinary warning within the Party, for not giving effective guidance for passengers about selfprotection. Managers of the company in charge of the construction site where the infected individual works were removed from their posts or admonished for failing to implement strict control measures such as disinfection, body temperature measurement, and wearing face masks, as well as realname registration for everyone coming to the site.
