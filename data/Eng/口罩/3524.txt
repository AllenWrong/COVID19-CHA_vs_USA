Wineries in the Ningxia Hui autonomous region are offering both incentives and supplies to medical staff who had worked on the front lines of the COVID epidemic. The Party committee of the Ningxia Helan Mountains East Foothill Wine Association has circulated a proposal to all wineries in the region to offer a free holiday for the medical staff around the country who have been involved in the epidemic fight in Hubei province. The wines are for the medical staff to open when they finally put their masks down and celebrate their victory over the epidemic. It is our social duty and responsibility as Chinese entities, companies and just as human beings, to take good care of the medical staff who take care of patients every day, said Christelle Chene, the French director of the Ningxia Helan Mountains East Foothill Wine Education Institute. Chene, a French woman who has been living in China for  years, decided to settle down permanently in the region last year, as she saw a greater and meaningful cause behind the business where local companies work together to help build and develop society and change peoples lives for the better.
