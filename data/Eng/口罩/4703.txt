Wuxis Binhu district used a local Party school as a quarantine site on March  for people returning from overseas in an effort to reduce imported cases. Medical workers from the districts health system have been taking hour shifts to help manage and provide for people being quarantined there. As part of epidemic prevention and control efforts, foreigners and overseas students are being subject to medical observation and are having their health conditions checked every day. The quarantine site is being disinfected regularly as well. Medical workers wear protective clothing, goggles, and masks when delivering meals, collecting garbage, and checking temperatures during the quarantine period. The quarantine site has been working to ensure there are enough daily supplies for international arrivals and is also attending to their psychological health. English, Korean, and Japanese translators are helping overcome language barriers and a WeChat group chat has been established to help satisfy the needs of foreigners. For example, one year old international student faced difficulties installing software needed to attend online classes and a medical worker helped him successfully install it. When receiving a nervous Australian mother and a crying threeyearold boy, medical workers explained the necessity of quarantine during the epidemic to the mother and helped comfort the boy.
