Pandemic defense deficiencies must be fixed

On the COVID resilience list of a US media outlet, the US ranked first. Thats something beyond normal thinking. Just think of , when the US almost collapsed due to COVID. Its politicians vacillating between lockdown and work resumption. While US society was so deeply split that it could not even form a consensus on wearing masks. This year there is the vaccine, but the US has only slowed the pandemic, not cut it. Its total number of infections is more than  million, while the number of deaths is above ,. Accounting for just  percent of the global population, the US accounts for  percent of the worlds deaths due to the virus. Its No  in its contempt for lives. On measuring the success of antipandemic efforts, there is only one index, namely keeping people safe. There is only one correct way of doing it, namely curing the sick and ensuring healthy people stay healthy. When vaccines came out this year, China helped the whole world get them, while the US has hoarded as many doses as it can. So who would speak highly of the US antipandemic efforts? This No  is a false and wornout crown, signaling the betrayal of the right to life. Time for US media to do their job, and push the politicians to stop wasting precious time.
