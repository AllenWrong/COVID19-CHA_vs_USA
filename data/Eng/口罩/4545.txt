As for overseas freight vehicles entering the border, the drivers are required to unload at the port and leave the country on the same day without having any direct contact with the working staff at the port, he said. Foreign drivers who are unable to leave China on the same day will be subject to temperature check, and will be directly transferred from the port to a designated place for closedoff management, he said, adding that they will not be permitted to go out of the designated place before leaving China. Li also noted that the ministry will set up temporary channels and special accommodation areas for the freight drivers and required transportation companies to ramp vehicle disinfection and epidemic prevention and control gears for the drivers.
