WASHINGTON  US Presidentelect Joe Biden on Monday received the second dose of the COVID vaccine, four weeks after he was administered the first shot. U.S. Presidentelect Joe Biden receives his second dose of a vaccine against the coronavirus disease COVID at ChristianaCare Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, US, January , . Biden was injected the second dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine at a hospital in Newark, Delaware, his home state were his transition headquarters is based. He received the first dose on December . Wearing a shortsleeved polo shirt so that the jab can be easily injected into his arm, Biden urged Americans to continue wearing masks, waving a black one of his own. The Pfizer vaccine  which, together with the Moderna vaccine, is being distributed across the country after gaining emergency use authorization  requires two doses to be injected several weeks apart. So does the Moderna vaccine. Biden has recently vowed to release nearly all of the coronavirus vaccines the country now possesses after taking office on Jan. , rather than withhold millions of vials to guarantee second doses are available. He also plans to get  million Americans vaccinated in his first  days in office. While the rollout of vaccines under the administration of President Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for being too slow that it failed to hit the initial target of delivering  million into the hands of Americans by the end of last year, Bidens plan seems to remain fluid, as reports surfaced that Biden vented frustration over the underperformance of his own transition team.
