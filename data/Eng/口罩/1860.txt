The US plans more arms sales to Taiwan. But the arms are just time bombs. Tsai Ingwen has tried to please the US with money, and by providing face masks during the pandemic. The US is busy facing its own troubles like social division, as well as failure to cope with the epidemic. Even though the US tried to offer her a hand, it wont be able to intervene in Chinas domestic affairs. How could they give up the issues at home, and keep looking across the Pacific instead? If Tsai fails to recognize the situation, she will pay for her illusions. Better do not let that happen. Tsai should realize that she is being used as part of the US game. The door for peaceful reunification remains open.
