JIN DINGCHINA DAILY At the opening ceremony of the third China International Import Expo in Shanghai on Wednesday, President Xi Jinping said via video that by Oct , China had offered assistance in the fight against the novel coronavirus to  countries and seven international organizations, exporting over  billion face masks, . billion personal protection suits and  million nucleic test kits. Among the first countries to have largely controlled the virus, China has shared its experience and offered necessary medical goods to other countries, as is expected from a major country with longterm commitments to global affairs. The assistance has helped in a big way in the fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has affected livelihoods and economies across the world since the beginning of this year. At this critical juncture, the world needs, more than ever before, to stay united, in the fight against the pandemic. Instead of blaming others for their failures, as some countries politicians have been doing, the correct attitude is to help each other. Of course, no matter how many face masks China manufacturers and sends to countries the world over, it cannot protect those who refuse to wear them. Although the experience of China and some other countries have proved the efficacy of face masks, people in some countries are still debating whether wearing face masks is effective in protecting people from the novel coronavirus. We hope that better sense prevails and these countries learn more from the good experience of other countries for their own good.
