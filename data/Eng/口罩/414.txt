US President Joe Biden.  WASHINGTON  US President Joe Biden on Friday urged unvaccinated Americans to get a jab sooner as the COVID pandemic continues to pose a threat to the countrys economic recovery. My message today is not one of celebration. Its one to remind us we got a lot of hard work left to be done both to beat the Delta variant and to continue our advance of economic recovery, Biden said in remarks from the White House following the release of a July employment report which showed nearly  million jobs were added to the economy. America can beat the Delta variant just as we beat the original COVID, Biden said. We can do this, so wear a mask when recommended, get vaccinated today. All of that will save lives and it means were not going to have the same kind of economic damage weve seen when COVID began. Because of our success with the vaccination effort, this new Delta variant wave of COVID will be very different, Biden said. Yes, cases are going to go up before they come back down. Its a pandemic of the unvaccinated, he said. Its taking a needless toll on our country. The COVID cases are surging across the United States because of the highlycontagious Delta variant while millions of Americans remain unvaccinated. White House COVID data director Cyrus Shahpar tweeted Friday that  percent of Americans all ages are now fully vaccinated.
