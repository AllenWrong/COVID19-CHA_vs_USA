Stricter measures should be taken to crack down on illegal acts related to antiepidemic supplies including hoarding, price gouging, as well as producing or selling fake and inferior products, said a teleconference held Wednesday by the State Administration for Market Regulation and six other departments. The country will step up supervision for all categories of antiepidemic supplies and raw materials, including masks, protective suits, ventilators, infrared thermometers and testing kits, said the conference. The conference also stressed the coordination of domestic and international markets and efforts to ensure the quality and order of medical supplies exports.
