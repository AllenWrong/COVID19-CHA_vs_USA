A pair of red Mary Jane shoes, by Lewis Walt. .com I still remember the day when I went to the market after being caged at home for nearly one month due to the COVID epidemic. People wearing masks walked slowly in the market, bargained casually with the vendors, and enjoyed the time that they could come out freely again. It was a large market in my hometown in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, where Han, Uygur and Kazakh people sold their specialties  homegrown vegetables, homemade yogurt, dried fruits and even ethnic clothes and musical instruments.

Among the people clad in dark colors, the red shoes, like a flash, soon highlighted her whole ensemble and left a strong impression with me. In that moment, I suddenly realized the beauty of red, especially as the color of shoes. It projected a sexy vitality, a strong desire to enjoy life and a subtle statement about ones existence in the world. This is exactly what people need to start anew after a natural disaster, like the epidemic that is still sweeping around the world. In the foreseeable future, the virus will be conquered. And when we win the battle, wear a pair of red shoes to celebrate the victory and begin our new life. From Gabors  spring collections.?.com ?
