? Bill Gates, cochair of Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, attends the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan , .  The majority of all US tests are completely garbage, wasted, said Bill Gates during an interview with a magazine. The US is the only country in the world where the most money is wasted on tests, according to the cofounder of Microsoft Corporation. Its mostly rich people that are having access to quicker tests, he said. You have to have the reimbursement system pay a little bit extra for  hours, pay the normal fee for  hours, and pay nothing if it isnt done by then, Gates told WIRED, a monthly American magazine. Gates also mentioned that he is disappointed with the performance of the United States during three time periods. The first period is from  until the coronavirus pandemic hit. If we had built up the diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine platforms, and if wed done the simulations to understand what the key steps were, wed be dramatically better off , Gates said in the interview. The second period is the first few months of the pandemic, when the US actually made it harder for the commercial testing companies to get their tests approved, the CDC had this very low volume test that didnt work at first, and they werent letting people test. The travel ban came too late, and it was too narrow to do anything, he added. The third period is that after the first few months, the US eventually figured out about masks, according to Gates.
