As for the five closedoff subdistricts in Dalian Jinpu New Area, they can make an application after  days of closed control with no new positive infections identified since Dec , , said Tang Yi, head of the Dalians Bureau of Civil Affairs. They must meet the standards made by the citys epidemic prevention and control headquarters, Tang said. The lifting of restrictions for those quarantined at home will come after  days of closeddoor isolation and negative results of four nucleic acid tests, he said. Tang said the communities efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic should be strengthened after lifting restrictions, including monitoring residents health and requiring people entering and leaving the residential compounds to scan their health code, wear a facial mask and monitor their temperature. In particular, they need to strengthen scanning people from key areas of epidemic concern. People coming to Dalian from abroad must complete  days of quarantine, while people from other domestic areas must take a nucleic acid test, which is given for free.
