Meanwhile, additional antiepidemic measures will be placed in those places, including virus tests for their staff every two weeks and customers required to use the LeaveHomeSafe app or register personal information to get in. The government also plans to allow group gatherings of no more than four people, relaxed from two currently, and resume inperson learning in schools and kindergartens with limited school time and scale. Despite the epidemic has begun to ease, Cheung called on residents to keep their guard up and stick to protective measures from wearing masks to reducing group gatherings as the battle against COVID has not ended.

Besides, the government is preparing for the mass inoculation of the COVID vaccine and aimed at giving free doses to most Hong Kong residents this year, Cheung added.
