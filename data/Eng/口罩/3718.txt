WASHINGTON  MLS teams Atlanta United and Sporting Kansas City on Sunday both announced that they will begin small group training sessions starting next Monday. The MLS announced on Thursday that clubs have been cleared to use outdoor team training facilities for small group training sessions. The small group training sessions must be voluntary and not be in conflict with local restrictions from public health officials or local government policies. According to guidelines laid out by the MLS, players may pass the ball and shoot on goal, but all training exercises must allow players to maintain a physical distance from each other. Coaches and technical staff must wear face masks at all times and goalkeepers may not spit on their gloves. This is the the first time that MLS players have been allowed to train together since the league suspended play on March  due to the spread of COVID. Earlier reports said the league is in negotiations with the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Disney World in Orlando for a possible season restart.
