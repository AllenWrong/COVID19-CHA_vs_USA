Schools and firms planning to accept them will be required to report in advance their planned activities in Japan and how they will be monitored. The government will begin accepting applications from their sponsors starting on Monday. However, the entry for tourists is yet to be open. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiji Kihara said, This time, the measures do not cover tourists. But the government is considering a plan to allow tourists to enter the country in stages. We will examine the effectiveness of monitoring new arrivals and the coronavirus situation, at around the end of the year.
