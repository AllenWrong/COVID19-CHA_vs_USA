Some sites will invite movie industry insiders and actors to share their views with audience before or after the movie. Altogether  movies,  making their China debuts, will be presented during the festival, at  cinemas in the city. The municipal COVID containment measures demand indoor cinemas have no more than onethird of seats occupied during each screening.

All tickets are sold to verified ID holders, and audiences will have their temperatures taken upon entering the cinema, which also provides hand sanitizer, free masks and disposable gloves. Audiences are asked to keep their masks on throughout their stay in the cinema, so no food or beverages are available. The festival suggested cinemagoers arrive a few minutes earlier than usual to avoid a long waiting period at the vending machine to pick up their tickets.
