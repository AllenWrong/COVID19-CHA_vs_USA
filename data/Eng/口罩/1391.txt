We must remain vigilant  it is critical we are getting tested with the mildest of symptoms, follow the health advice and continue to be COVIDSafe right across the state. A one person per  square metres still applied for hospitality venues, however authorities said if current trends continued that could change to a one person per  square metres in roughly two weeks time. NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant urged the public to continue attending free testing clinics if they showed any symptoms in order to prevent the virus from spreading again.
