PHOTOS PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY Logistics companies were reminded by the Ministry of Transport on Friday to conduct thorough disinfection of coldchain food imports to prevent the transmission of COVID. Dockworkers are also required to wear masks when moving imported coldchain food cargoes, especially from highrisk areas, said ministry spokesman Sun Wenjian at a news conference. When handling imported cargoes, workers should avoid putting goods close to their face and not touch their mouth or nose. They are also forbidden from opening food wrapping to prevent potential contact with the virus, Sun said. The strict safety protocols are to protect frontline workers including drivers, porters and maritime workers, he said. The ministry this month released a guideline to prevent the transmission of COVID through coldchain foods imported via road and sea. It has also urged regulators of the civil aviation, rail and logistics industries to draw up regulations on transportation of coldchain imports to prevent COVID. Recent confirmed cases in China have been associated with imported frozen foods.
