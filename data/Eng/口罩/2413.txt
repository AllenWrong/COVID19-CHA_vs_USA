With all appropriate sanitary measures in place, as mentioned below, the  States Parties to the  Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage will come together after strenuous lockdown measures. Many issues vital to the Convention are to be discussed. Beyond the usual discussions such as revisions of the Operational Directives, elections to the Committee or management of the ICH Fund, the States Parties will be invited to reflect on the listing mechanisms of the Convention and the very timely topic of intangible cultural heritage in emergencies. A virtual ResiliArt debate will also take place on  September, during lunch, to allow communities from Italy, Mali, Palestine, Peru and Sri Lanka to speak about their living heritage in the context of the COVID pandemic. During the meeting, participants will be asked to respect strict sanitary measures, including wearing a mask at all times, maintain physical distance and following strict circulation measures. To allow all stakeholders of the Convention to follow the debates in spite of travel restrictions, the UNESCO Secretariat has made efforts to webcast the proceedings, and, for the first time, the General Assembly of the  Convention will be fully videocast, in all  languages of the UN. As the sanitary situation continues to evolve, the Secretariat will publish any further changes to these measures on the website of the Convention.
