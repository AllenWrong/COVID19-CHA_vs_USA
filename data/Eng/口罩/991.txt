Nantong in East Chinas Jiangsu province recently started offering free COVID vaccine shots to local residents as part of the countrys vaccination campaign against the virus, local media outlets reported. Those aged between  and  can make an appointment for the vaccination using their ID cards at community centers or workplaces. Each person will receive two doses of a vaccine  to  days apart. Some people might think getting vaccinated isnt urgent as China has successfully controlled the epidemic, but it is still raging globally and no one can remain isolated from the world, said He Qinghua, an official of the National Health Commission. Experts from the Nantong center for disease control and prevention explained that vaccination is the most effective way to control the epidemic. Current data shows that the domestically produced vaccine is safe and effective and a twodose vaccine can provide protection for more than six months. However, experts stressed that people should still take regular precautions, such as wearing masks, washing their hands frequently, and receiving nucleic acid tests if necessary, as no vaccine is  percent effective in preventing the virus.
