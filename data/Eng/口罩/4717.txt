On the afternoon of  April, Dr. Zhang Wenhong sat down for an online interview with Peoples Daily and discussed some hot topics with netizens.  Dr. Zhang refuted some foreign medias claim that China is hiding cases, You cant hide infectious disease cases.  Dr. Zhang said, China has controlled it very well, so well that you cant believe it. Many foreign media are saying the number of cases in China is so small, especially in Shanghai, and are there patients who have been kept under wraps? When this question was discussed in my recent talks with heads of public health schools of some countries, I said, What is there to hide? We restarted business operation on  February and it has been two months now. If we were hiding many cases and I am sitting here talking to you today, dare I not wear a mask? Infectious diseases have a characteristic that the cases cannot be hidden. If there were many hidden cases, I will ask you only one question Dare we reopen Wuhan? We dare not. This is something the experts understand perfectly well. There are many people in the world who recognize what China has achieved. I think it is important to publicize more about how we did it, and how these experiences might be applied to other countries, in terms of what kind of strategies may work in what kind of countries. I believe we need more exchanges in this regard in the future.
