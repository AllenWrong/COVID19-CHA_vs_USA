Passengers with face masks are seen in a bus in New York City, the United States, Aug , .  Caleb Wallace, who had organized an antiface mask movement in Texas, United States, died of COVID on Saturday. He was just . Before him, H Scott Apley, a Texas Republican official who participated in a maskburning party had died of COVID. The antimask movement, which started during the  flu pandemic, seems to have gained strength during the ongoing COVID pandemic. A century ago, the antimask groups said masks prevented people from getting enough oxygen. Today, such groups also claim the vaccines are actually microchips that connect vaccinated people to the G network so they can be spied on. In other words, people are still spreading conspiracy theories in the US despite the great scientific and technological progress humans have made. Worse, the antimask groups enjoy the support of some politicians. During the Donald Trump administration, most of those opposing mask wearing were Republican supporters. Even after the incumbent president, Joe Biden, issued an administrative order making the wearing of masks in public places mandatory, many people in Florida defied the regulation even though they had to pay a fine for it. Unfortunately, wearing a mask has become a political, not a healthrelated, issue in the US. The antimask groups are using social networking sites to spread disinformation and attract more supporters. They have formed teams on social media platforms and held discussions to spread antiscience messages. Will Wallaces death make them change their minds? Probably not. For Apleys death made no difference to them. But by spreading lies, the antimask groups are making more people vulnerable to the novel coronavirus, which is still to be contained in the US.
