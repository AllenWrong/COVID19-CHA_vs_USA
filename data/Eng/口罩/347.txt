Texas Governor Greg Abbott speaks at the annual National Rifle Association NRA convention in Dallas, Texas, US, on May , .  HOUSTON  Governor Greg Abbott of US state Texas has tested positive for COVID though he is fully vaccinated, the governors office announced in a statement on Tuesday. Governor Abbott is fully vaccinated against COVID, in good health, and currently experiencing no symptoms, said the statement. Abbott will isolate in the governors mansion and continue to test daily, said his office, adding that Abbott is receiving Regenerons monoclonal antibody treatment. Texas First Lady Cecilia Abbott tested negative, the statement added. Abbott, a Republican, tweeted photos of him addressing a maskless crowd in Collin County on Monday night, according to local media outlet the Texas Tribune. The governor also tweeted pictures of a meeting with guitarist Jimmie Vaughan just hours before his diagnosis was announced Tuesday afternoon. Abbott issued an executive order late last month banning vaccination and mask mandates despite the rapid surge of COVID cases across the state and fierce pushback from local officials and schools districts. The states Supreme Court recently upheld the governors executive order. However, school districts in Harris and Tarrant counties, two of the most populous areas in the state, defied the order as students prepared to return to classrooms. The rise in new infections has already pushed some healthcare systems in Texas to capacity. Abbott earlier asked hospitals to stop nonemergency medical procedures to free up space for COVID patients, and announced that outofstate healthcare workers would come to assist, according to local media reports.
