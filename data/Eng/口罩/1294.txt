A woman wears a protective face mask while carrying her dog as the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease continues, in New York City on Nov , .  Its been a long winter for the United States, with hospitals seeing more coronavirus patients than at any point in the pandemic and the average number of daily deaths topping , for the first time, the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC reports on Saturday. Experts say theres still a long path ahead before life in the US return to some form of normality over the next few months. It will be many more months before we see not necessarily a return to normalcy, but the emergence of a new normal, Dr Keri Althoff, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, told the Londonbased broadcaster. Im hesitant to put a date on it because every time we figure something out with this virus, it seems to have another trick up its sleeve, said Dr Althoff. New normal will see public health officials continuing to recommend social distancing and face masks while warning against any large social gatherings, inside or out, she added. Many people in the US are feeling exhausted by this virus. Its totally normal and we need to be empathetic towards that, but this virus is not going to just go away, said Dr Althoff. So we have to continue to protect ourselves and our families and our communities.
