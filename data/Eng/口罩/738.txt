TOKYO  The mandatory quarantine period for inbound travelers to Japan who have visited India, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan or Sri Lanka within  days of arrival will be extended from six to  days, the Japanese government said Tuesday. The move, which will come into effect on Friday, comes as Japan is grappling with a fourth wave of infections amid mounting concerns over the highlytransmissible variant first detected in India, the government said. There is a strong feeling of unease among the Japanese people regarding coronavirus variants, so we have decided to further tighten border controls in order to protect their health and lives, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a press briefing. Travelers who have visited any of the six regions will be subjected to a mandatory day quarantine period spent at a designated facility, during which time they will have to undergo three COVID tests, the government said. The new measure will mainly affect Japanese citizens who have been to any of the six countries, as the government had already banned entry to all foreign nationals and those who have residency status, who have visited India or any other of the five South Asian countries within the past two weeks. A threeday quarantine period will also be imposed on those who have recently been to Kazakhstan or Tunisia.
