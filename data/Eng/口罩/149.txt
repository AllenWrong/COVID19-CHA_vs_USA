A medical worker administers a dose of COVID vaccine to a citizen at a community health center in Qingxiu district of Nanning, South Chinas Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, Aug , .  China may open its borders after it vaccinates over  percent of its population by early , said Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in a recent interview. The current epidemic control measures against COVID in China have won a lot of time to produce enough vaccines and inoculate people, he told news outlet ifeng. If the vaccination rate can reach more than  percent in early , there will be few infections and none of those infected would be in serious condition or die. Besides, the virulence of the coronavirus is also decreasing, according to Gao. By that time, why shouldnt we open up? he said. When the prevalence and fatality rate of COVID are more like that of the flu, and it seems it would coexist with humans, the efforts to root out the virus will be a protracted war, he said. In that case, we should continue to vaccinate more people, develop new vaccines, and especially, produce effective drugs. He added since its still possible for vaccinated people to get infected, its important for everyone to keep wearing masks, maintain social distancing and wash their hands frequently.
