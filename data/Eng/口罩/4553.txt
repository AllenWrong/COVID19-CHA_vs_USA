SHENYANG  A branch company of Chinas largest oil and gas producer PetroChina has put into operation a new production line of meltblown nonwoven fabric in Northeast Chinas Liaoning province on Thursday. It is expected to manufacture  tonnes of meltblown nonwoven fabric a year. Another production line with the same annual capacity is being built to further boost the raw material supply to mask producers, according to PetroChina Liaoyang Petrochemical Company. As the essential material to make medical masks, meltblown nonwoven fabric is the filtering layer in the middle part of the mask. It took workers around  days to build the production line, which usually needed at least six months, the company said. Chinas centrallyadministered Stateowned enterprises have joined the efforts to stem COVID by producing raw materials for mask makers. On Wednesday, Chinas largest oil refiner Sinopec has built and begun operating another two production lines of meltblown nonwoven fabric in Beijing.
