BEIJING  Chinas new loans have reached nearly  trillion yuan  billion in the first quarter of this year as the country steps up financial support to shore up the virushit economy, according to a senior banking official. This compares with the . trillion yuan of new yuandenominated loans in the same period last year. Zhou Liang, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, revealed the figure at a press conference Friday, noting that the increased new loans have greatly supported the real economy in a time when the global COVID pandemic has given rise to economic recession risks and brought external shocks to Chinas economic and social development. Liu Guoqiang, vice governor of Chinas central bank, said at the press conference that for the next stage, Chinas prudent monetary policy will be pursued with more moderate flexibility, and more attention will be paid to supporting the recovery of the real economy. The central bank will keep market liquidity reasonably sufficient to meet practical demands and avoid either a cash shortage or soaring inflation, and that the increase in M money supply and aggregate financing should match or be slightly higher than the nominal GDP growth, he said.
