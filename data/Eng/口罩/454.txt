 WASHINGTON  The United States on Monday hit President Joe Bidens goal of administering  percent of adults with at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, almost a month after the July  target date. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions website showed that . percent of adults, and . percent of the total population, have now been fully vaccinated. The Biden administration initially targeted the countrys Independence Day to hit the goal and declare victory over the worst of the pandemic. But falling vaccination rates, particularly in politically conservative regions in the South and Midwest, and among groups like younger people, those with lower income and racial minorities, meant the objective was missed. Recent weeks however have seen an uptick in the vaccination rate in the regions hit hardest by the latest Covid wave, which is being driven by the hypercontagious Delta variant. States such as Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, and Florida have all seen significant increases. The national average of daily cases is currently higher than , and rising rapidly. However, with  percent of seniors fully vaccinated, hospitalizations and deaths are rising far slower than in previous waves. While one dose of an mRNA vaccine by Pfizer or Moderna conferred strong protection against previously dominant variants, new peerreviewed research highlights the need for two doses against the Delta variant. Federal health authorities are also debating whether a third dose may be required for certain groups such as the immunocompromised. The CDC has also reinstituted guidance for fully vaccinated people to wear masks indoors in highrisk areas, after a preliminary analysis suggested that people who have breakthrough cases of the Delta variant might be able to transmit the virus onward.
