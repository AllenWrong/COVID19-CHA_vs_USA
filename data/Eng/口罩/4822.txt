Local corporations and institutions in Shanghai are encouraged to provide novel coronavirus tests to employees from regions most affected by the virus, said the leadership group for the containment of COVID in Shanghai on Wednesday. As Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, lifted its day travel ban and allowed those with the necessary certifications to leave the city, Shanghai has called on the public to remain vigilant as asymptomatic infections remain a threat. We have to give priority to preventing imported cases from abroad, while strengthening the management of the asymptomatic cases of infection, said the leadership group office. The municipality will further strengthen its measures to contain the spread of the virus. Medical institutions, including  fever clinics and  community locations, will screen suspected cases and conduct epidemiological investigations. Those who have traveled to the most infected regions or have come into close contact with high risk individuals will be tested for COVID. The city will also encourage and support local enterprises and institutions to test their employees  new hires and returning staff from such regions  for the virus. Employers can apply for the tests through the districtlevel public health administrations, which will designate medical clinics to take the samples.
