Eight selfservice machines have been set up at each entrance of the two amusement projects  GuMuYouLong and JueDing XiongFeng. Through the machines, tourists can receive tickets with a queuing number after registering their identity via facial recognition. Afterwards, they must subscribe to the official WeChat account of the park ghbacc by scanning the QR code on the ticket. After finishing the aforementioned procedures, visitors can rest assured, as the WeChat account will provide an estimated realtime wait time before they can enter the park. Visitors can still enter within  minutes after missing their number. If visitors exceed this grace period, staff at the park are still authorized to allow entry. The park is open from  am to  pm, with some indoor attractions remaining closed. Visitors are required to wear face masks, have their temperature taken and maintain a safe distance from others during the visit. Official Website httpwww.happyvalley.cn
