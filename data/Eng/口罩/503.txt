Top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci responds to accusations by Sen. Rand Paul RKY as he testifies before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Capitol hill in Washington, July , .  WASHINGTON  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is weighing revising its COVID guidelines to recommend that even fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, said Anthony Fauci, White House chief medical advisor, on Sunday. Fauci told CNN that he has taken part in conversations about altering the guidelines, something he described as being under active consideration. He noted that some local areas where infection rates are surging are already urging individuals to wear masks in public regardless of their vaccination status. COVID cases, deaths and hospitalizations continue to increase among the unvaccinated across the United States. Health experts have blamed the recent surges on the low vaccination rates and the accelerating Delta variant transmission.
