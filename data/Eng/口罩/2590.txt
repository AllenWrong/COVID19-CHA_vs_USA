Universities and colleges have started the autumn semester with strict epidemic prevention and control measures in place, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission announced on Wednesday. Zhang Xu, director of the Logistics Department of the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission, said each university must manage the flow of personnel entering the school, ensuring that all staff and visitors register and verify their identities. Masks, thermometers, disinfectants and other antiepidemic materials must be stored in public areas such as the school entrances, dormitories and teaching buildings, Zhang added. Many universities have implemented a new educational model that incorporates online and offline teaching. For example, Shanghai Jiao Tong University has turned  classrooms into livestreaming classrooms, said Wang Weiming, viceprincipal of the university. According to Wang, classes for students will be livestreamed so that those who are unable to be on campus will not miss out on lessons.
