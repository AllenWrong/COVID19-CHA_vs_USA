The Chinese Mission to the European Union EU has slammed the European External Action Service EEAS for accusing China of disinformation regarding COVID. The mission said, a disinformation report that has no factual basis is in itself an example of disinformation. The remarks on Thursday came after the EEAS released an updated version of the short assessment of narratives and disinformation around the COVID pandemic. The report accused China and Russia of using statecontrolled media to spread disinformation and claimed that vaccine diplomacy has replaced mask diplomacy.
