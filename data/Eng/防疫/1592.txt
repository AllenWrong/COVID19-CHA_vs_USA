PhotoAgencies    Responding to researchers claims that a lack of resources and insecure employment terms within Swedens elderly care system contributed to a failure in protecting the elderly, Hallengren told Radio Sweden that she agreed and that the epidemic had revealed major flaws in the elderly care system. Marta Szebehely, a professor emeritus in social work at Stockholm University who specializes in elderly care research told Radio Sweden The systems resources have not increased as the number of elderly people has gone up and therefore there was a lack of preparedness when the coronavirus arrived and that could have been avoided had there been higher staffing levels and fewer temps. Those are the two most significant aspects here. Hallengren agreed, noting that a new effort to raise the quality of care will involve offering permanent positions to those who currently rely highly on temporary contracts, as well as extending further education opportunities so they can obtain auxiliary nurse certificates and thereby also earn higher salaries. However, Mats Thorslund, a professor in social gerontology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said the major challenge is not how to shore up todays elderly care system but rather how to guarantee a functioning system in the future. If we are to keep todays standard in, say,  years time when we will have far more elderly people who are in the final stages of life and who will need both medical and social care, then the budget needs a boost of around  million SEK . million U.S. dollars per year, at the very least, said Thorslund, who is part of the Swedish governments newly appointed Corona Commission, Radio Sweden reported.
