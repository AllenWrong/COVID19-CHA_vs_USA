With the novel coronavirus outbreak highlighting the need for systems that can prevent, detect and respond to public health crises, the United Nations has designated Dec  as the International Day for Epidemic Preparedness, with Sunday marking its debut.That neither the  flu pandemic nor the HIVAIDS pandemic starting in the s prompted the UN to establish such a day, shows not only the magnitude of the ongoing COVID pandemic, but also how urgent the world body thinks it is for the international community to draw lessons from it.As of Sunday, the novel coronavirus had infected about . million people around the world, and killed . million of them. But in the face of urgent need, even the health systems in the developed countries have proved to be frail and unreliable. Not to mention the lack of international cooperation and multilateralism in the response to the pandemic, particularly during the early stage of the outbreak, when name calling, conspiracy theories and unilateralism were rife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
