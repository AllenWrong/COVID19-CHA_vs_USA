Expert group will conduct joint scientific studies with their Chinese counterparts                     An international expert team from the World Health Organization has arrived in Wuhan, Hubei province, to work with their Chinese counterparts on origin tracing and scientific research of the novel coronavirus.  The team arrived at the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport on Thursday morning and will follow local epidemic regulations by undergoing quarantine first, according to a brief report by the China Global Television Network.  The WHO posted a tweet writing that an international team of  scientists examining the origins of the COVID virus had arrived in Wuhan.  Another two scientists are still in Singapore completing tests for COVID.  All team members had multiple negative polymerase chain reaction and antibody tests for COVID in their home countries prior to traveling.  They were tested again in Singapore and were all negative for PCR.But two members tested positive for IgM antibodies. They are being retested for both IgM and IgG antibodies, said the WHO.  Prior to this visit, the WHO expert teams tracing the origin of the novel coronavirus had visited China twicein February and Julyat the invitation of China. The two sides have continued exchanging information on the latest progress in origin tracing, and worked together to formulate a broader plan for global cooperation on tracing the origin of the virus.  WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at an earlier media briefing that he is pleased that the team, which comprises of members from countries including the United States, Russia and Japan, will travel to China for joint scientific research on origin tracing with their Chinese counterparts.  Scientific evidence will drive hypotheses, which will then be the basis for further, longerterm studies, he said. This is important not just for COVID, but for the future of global health security and to manage emerging disease threats with pandemic potential.  Some experts have said that it will be a very difficult task to find the origin of the novel coronavirus, and no significant progress has been made over the past year.  Although some of the earliest COVID cases were reported in Wuhans Huanan Seafood Market in December , there was no evidence to link the wholesale market to the origin of the coronavirus, despite great efforts from Chinese researchers to search for an answer, said Gao Fu, director of Chinas Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in an earlier interview with China Daily.  The latest research and discoveries about the earliest cases of the novel coronavirus in some other countries have pointed to the possibility that the virus may have existed in nature for a long time before the earliest COVID cases were reported, he said.  wangxiaodongchinadaily.com.cn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
