Song Chen  China Daily    In early January, China announced the outbreak of a novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic later known as COVID. In order to control and contain the wide spread of the virus, the Chinese government took appropriate measures by first shutting down all transports connected to Wuhan and restricting the movement of people within the country. A total war was launched against the epidemic, with the government, medical workers, engineers and the people standing together with one heart to fight a common enemy. Within a period of less than two weeks, a hospital with a capacity of more than a thousand beds was built in the city to accommodate those who had been infected. As the war against the virus intensified, the academic sector was fully involved from every side possible. In order to ensure the continuation of academic activities, a stayathome online class program was deployed, and universities also launched a practical measure to protect foreign students on campus from being infected. Zhejiang Normal University was on the frontline in this regard. Like a mother caring for her child, the management and staff of Zhejiang Normal University took up the care for her foreign students still on campus. The students were checked on regularly and were given advice on taking preventive measures against the virus. The university gates were locked down, with restrictions of movement in and out of the university. Only those with authorization can leave the premises, and no outside is permitted within the campus. To make life on campus more convenient during the stayathome period, the university provided a temporary minimarket on campus for students to purchase foods. This helped in a long way to reduce the possibility of contracting the virus when going to outside market. Apart from protecting international students from the virus, they also showed great concern as students were visited in their respective dorms with gifts like cake bread, milk, dry foodstuffs and face masks, along with words of encouragement to students to firmly believe in victory and also shoulder responsibilities with confidence.        Author NNEBEDUM MAGNUS TOCHUKWU     From the experience I have in this unique period, one thing is clear China is a great country and capable of fighting together to overcome this virus. It is very obvious from the resources deployed by the Chinese government and the people no country has such a level of national unity in combating a common enemy. The Chinese effort combating this virus is a model for every country of the world on how a country and people should stand up with unity of purpose always, not just in a time of crisis. People from different parts of the country were seen willingly volunteering to go to Wuhan to join medical workers on the frontline and be part of efforts to overcome the virus. Those who are not in the medical field contributed their own way by giving what they had to those living in Wuhan and areas affected by the virus. The major victory for China in this battle is the spirit of unity and love among the people, and this is what enabled China to surmount the challenge of COVID. Though the battle is still ongoing, victorys light can be seen at the end of the tunnel. When the battle against the virus is over, the unity of purpose among the Chinese people will become stronger and nothing will stop the country from rising up again after the virus is overcome. The care and love shown to us by the management and staff of Zhejiang Normal University was very heartwarming. We the students firmly believe in victory and we stand together with China to fight and overcome the common enemy COVID. March on Zhejiang Normal University! March on Wuhan! March on China! Let us all arise as one family to root this virus out of China and the whole world.
