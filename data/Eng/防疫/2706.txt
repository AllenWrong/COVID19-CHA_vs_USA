She then saw her heartbeats turn into small stones thrown into the water, creating beautiful, rhythmic ripples in a pond on the ground. Its an amazing experience! Hearing the slapping sound and seeing the ripples made me feel more than alive and calm. Interestingly, I felt connected with my inner self, said Shen, a visitor who interacted with Chinese artist Zhang Muchens Heart Beats, a digital art installation on show at the Beijing Times Art Museum. Zhangs work is one of the  installations, spanning photography, GIF, video, and interactive media, featured at Empathy  Connection, a contemporary art exhibit, inspired by the status quo of human society because of the ongoing COVID pandemic.
