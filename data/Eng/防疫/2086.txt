Coordinated protection by neighbors

In the face of the novel coronavirus outbreak, the Republic of Koreas difficulties are ours.  Confronting the epidemic, China and Japan are in the same boat.  That was what the Chinese foreign minister said in his respective telephone conversations with his ROK and Japanese counterparts.  While it has come about in the worst conceivable way, the public health threat that is no respecter of borders has been a reminder to the three countries that they share the same neighborhood. Timely and sufficient information sharing, response coordination and mutual assistance are key to containing the epidemic both at home and across borders. And mutual understanding is the cornerstone for all that.  In his phone call with the ROK foreign minister, Wang Yi spoke of the critical significance of controlling and reducing unnecessary crossborder personnel mobility at the earliest possible time to cut off the spread of the virus. And speaking to his Japanese counterpart, he called for greater coordination to prevent the crossborder spread of the epidemic and effectively safeguard public health in both countries and the region at large.  Yet as the foreign ministers communication indicates, there is a dilemma facing all three countries. Stringent control over human mobility and corresponding quarantine measures have already disrupted industry chains and supply chains in the neighborhood, which is being most keenly felt throughout the auto manufacturing sectors in three countries.  While the top priority for the moment is closer engagement among the three parties to curb the spread of the virus, helping their struggling enterprises and preserving their industry chains and supply chains are also crucial tasks.  The chief diplomats exchange of vows for deeper collaboration on the official level sent an inspiring message of hope that the three governments may get along better after this is over. That there is mutual goodwill and support on the peopletopeople level is already evident. Helping hands from the two neighbors from the very beginning of the outbreak have been much appreciated by the Chinese public.  Mountains and rivers apart, we share same winds and moon under same sky. Those heartwarming lines printed on boxes of lifesaving essentials from Japan have been etched deeply on Chinese hearts.  The ROK and Japanese governments and people have provided China with strong support and assistance since the start of the epidemic, for which the latter is deeply grateful. And while combating the virus at home, China is ready to reciprocate the kindness they have shown.  In times of misfortune a good neighbor is a blessing. By upholding their pledges to stand together, the three neighbors can make their troubles less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
