The overwhelming season of celebration is just two weeks away, while the suspicion of a mystery respiratory disease outbreak at an epidemic level looms over two densely populated Chinese cities, Hong Kong and Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuetngor announced on Tuesday contingency plans for public health and disease prevention after Wuhan reported a mini outbreak of viral pneumonia of unknown causes with  patients placed in isolated hospital care. The social impact of the disease is not alarming and the majority of residents in Hong Kong do not wear masks, though the price of masks increased and the supply of N respirators is running low. According to latest news reports on Monday, no new cases of infections have been found, and no patients have died from the disease so far. All  are recovering in hospital and medical professionals working on finding the source of the mystery virus have ruled out those that cause such epidemics as SARS, Middle East respiratory tract infection RTI and bird flu. Still, Hong Kong residents have every reason to take preventive measures against any form of RealTime Innovations, particularly viral ones. It is somewhat comforting to know that the viral pneumonia in Wuhan has shown no evidence it can be transmitted from person to person through physical contact or airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing. However, we do know some of the patients had been to one particular wet market in Wuhan in late December before they were diagnosed with viral pneumonia. That is why public health professionals have maintained close observation of more than  people who came into close range of the patients when the latter showed signs of RTIs. The good news is none of them has fallen ill so far, but it is not time to let our guard down. Although the mysterious pneumonia has not triggered panic among members of the public, there is no guarantee other infectious viruses will not reach epidemic levels during the holiday season, when people busy themselves with feasts and parties. Excessive partying can cause exhaustion and mess up peoples immune system with poor diet and lack of sleep, while bad ventilation in crowded bars and similar places makes it much easier for viral RTIs to spread than outdoors. After all, there are no better times and conditions for epidemic outbreaks than winter, especially when Chinese people celebrate their most cherished time of family reunions. Residents on the mainland and in Hong Kong travel across the country to hold almost nonstop feasting and partying for days on end. In addition, the risk of respiratory disease outbreaks remains alarmingly high when millions of people take overcrowded public transportations on their journeys to their hometowns. As such, the chief executive said her administration is fully prepared for the challenge. Besides the readymade thermal imaging systems which are the legacy of fighting against SARS in , the Hong Kong government has made it compulsory for doctors to notify authorities about any suspected cases. The Department of Health has gazetted a bill to amend the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance to give legal powers to the health authorities to isolate patients suspected of having contracted the unidentified virus. The Spring Festival is approaching and surveillance of the pneumonialike illness is being stepped up. Hong Kong has experienced a black Christmas the city now longs for a festive season that offers muchneeded relief to usher in the Year of the Rat.                                                                               !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
