The new measure applies to all arrivals except confirmed COVID cases, suspected cases, close contacts, and people who have a fever or respiratory symptoms, as well as those who have traveled or lived overseas within the past  days, it added. Arrivals are asked to follow requirements, including holding valid exit or entry documents and a health certificate, and to cooperate with relevant agencies at mainland port areas in epidemic prevention and control, and border inspections, the announcement said. Personal health information should also be declared when entering the mainland. If travelers show symptoms such as a fever, fatigue or a dry cough after arriving, they should promptly go to a designated hospital for screening and treatment, and report to their local community or other relevant departments.
