JU HUANZONGXINHUANANNINGAfter putting on a red uniform and a face mask at  am, Huang Juan gets ready to conduct a daily quarantine check on  households and shops in her community in Nanning, capital of South Chinas Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.For the past few weeks, she has done this each and every day. The necessary routine designed to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus disease, or COVID, was so arduous that Huang regularly topped the table on the cellphone pedometer app she uses.Among her everyday items is a resident roster on which she has logged the health condition of every household. Now, she has memorized most of the information.Guangxi has more than , gridbased community workers like Huang. Millions more safeguard a total of , urban and rural communities across China. Since the outbreak, they have done their utmost to keep the virus out of their territories.Gridbased management of populated communities and neighborhoods is like dividing a big cabinet into small grids and placing objects in order, so you are no longer clueless. Whenever you need to check or sort out anything, its easy to do, says Chen Wenjun, a senior official of Liuzhaizi village in Liaoning, a province some , kilometers northeast of Guangxi.As for Anhui, an inland province, all the villages and residential communities of its  cities have adopted closedoff management since Feb  under a series of thorough and strict measures, where gridbased community workers had to multitask between gatekeepers, publicists and stewards, says Meng Kai, a yearold gridbased worker in the city of Bengbu.Meng says that he could not recall how many times he had climbed up and down to bring in food, take out the garbage and offer psychological advice, noting that on the busiest day, he climbed more than  flights of stairs.Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, has some , grids and , gridbased community workers. Each worker takes care of  to  households, according to Luo Ping, deputy secretary of the Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China Municipal Committee of Wuhan.Gridbased management in Wuhan has been running at full speed since Feb , when the citys headquarters for epidemic prevention and control required all residential areas to implement closedoff management.Grid staff are versatile, says Hua Qing, head of a local community affairs committee on Hanxing Street of Jianghan district, Wuhan, who also served as an ordinary gridbased community worker. We are not only community workers, but also purchasing agents, delivery workers, barefoot doctors and psychologists.Grid workers in Huas community would queue at the hospital around midnight to buy drugs for their residents who were in urgent need.Since the community was closed off, we have completed  orders for those who suffer from diseases like cancer, diabetes, hypertension and heart attacks, Hua says.Many foreigners have volunteered to join the gridbased campaign.The hard work Chinese grassroots workers have done is unforgettable. Their assistance reached into seemingly trivial matters, and they never complained, says Thomas Deshors, a French national who has helped deliver batches of face masks to several communities in Chengdu, capital of Southwest Chinas Sichuan province.Gridbased workers have built the first line of defense against the virus, says Luo Ping, the Party official from the city of Wuhan.There have been no newly confirmed coronavirus cases reported in Huas community on Hanxing Street of Jianghan District, Wuhan, for a week.Meng Tianyuan, an urban management worker in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu province, recently had a busy day working together with gridbased workers, whom he would prefer to consider as net weavers.Their work is like thousands of threads woven into a net, firmly protecting the residents in communities, Meng says. They may not be as professional as medical staff at the frontline, but they are great and respectable.No winter lasts forever, and no spring skips its turn. I believe that with the joint effort of the whole nation, the epidemic will eventually pass, Meng says.
