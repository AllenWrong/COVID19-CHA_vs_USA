The patient looked well and spoke in a low but powerful voice. Another hospital staff member present when He was discharged wore a full protective suit, on the back of which were four handwritten characters that translated as welcome home. When He visited the Xinfadi wholesale market, to which all the cases in the new cluster were linked, he pulled his face mask to one side to get some fresh air. He remembers going to the market on June  to buy mutton, and staying there for about  minutes. The beef and mutton trading hall at the market was later found to be the source of the most of the new infections.
