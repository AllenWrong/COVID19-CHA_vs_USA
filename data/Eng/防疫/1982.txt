China has seen huge benefits brought by the deep integration of information technology and digital transformation amid the outbreak, Gao Gao, deputy secretarygeneral of the National Development and Reform Commission, said during a news conference. Big data, telemedicine, ecommerce, mobile payment and other technologies and services have played a key role in epidemic prevention and resumption of work. And now we have a better understanding of emerging sectors such as telecommuting and online education. He believed digital economy will be a critical engine for the economic growth, and various industries will accelerate the push for digital transformation. To better hedge against the epidemics impact, China will step up the construction of new infrastructure such as G, data centers and industrial internet, Gao added. More efforts will also be made to promote the development of big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, internet of things and other technologies, foster a batch of digital economy sectors that will create more jobs, accelerate the transformation of traditional industries and promote the sustained and healthy development of sharing economy. In the next step, the NDRC will also focus on weak links, and increase the investment on related fields.
