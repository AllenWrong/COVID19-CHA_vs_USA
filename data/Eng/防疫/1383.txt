Japans Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga speaks during a news conference at the prime ministers office in Tokyo, Japan Aug , . PhotoAgencies    Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Friday that he will not run for president of the Liberal Democratic Party in order to focus on the COVID pandemic prevention and control. That means Suga will step down as Japans prime minister when his term as LDP president ends at the end of the month. As a matter of fact, his withdrawal is partly due to the LDPs loss of popular support. Since he took office, Suga has led the LDP to defeat in several byelections for Diet members, and elections for local assembly and mayoral elections, such as in Tokyo and Yokohama. The Suga administration has failed to control the pandemic and its response to the epidemic has disappointed the public. The vaccination rate in Japan has been the lowest among developed countries. It is against that background that the approval rating of Sugas cabinet dropped from around  percent when he took office last year to less than  percent now, similar to the approval rating of Abes cabinet when he resigned last year.That has fueled discontent about Suga within the LDP. It is Sugas plummeting influence within the LDP that has ultimately forced him to drop his bid for the LDP presidency. The ensuing LDP presidential election will be fierce, but the direction of the Japanese political situation after the election will be worth paying attention to.Whoever wins will immediately face three thorny tasks securing the LDPs victory in the lowerhouse elections, raising Japans vaccination rate and keeping the economy growing. Given the difficulty of tackling these challenges, after Suga steps down, Japan is likely to return to the era of shortlived cabinets as it experienced before , when the average tenure of the countrys  prime ministers was just two years.
