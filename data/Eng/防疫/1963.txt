Fact According to Ruan Guangfeng from China Food Information Center, the saying that vitamin C helps improve immunity originates from peoples knowledge about colds, which is scientifically groundless. There is no proof that vitamin C relieves or cures colds. Ruan said it is not necessary for healthy people to take extra supplements to prevent the disease as long as they get enough nutrition from a balanced diet.? As for those who stay at home during the epidemic control, Ruan suggests taking vitamin C if fresh vegetables and fruit are temporarily unavailable   milligrams for adults and no more than  milligrams for those who are pregnant. Vitamin C supplements are not an alternative to fresh food, he said.?
