Weve all been looking forward to heading outdoors with the horses again, he said.Chinese equestrian activities and interest had been on the upswing before COVID hit, with industry figures recording about , riding clubs across the country, growing more than three times in the past few years.But as part of comprehensive antioutbreak efforts, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Sports put out strict guidelines for the prevention and control of the operation of outdoor sports and fitness venues.Michelle Wang, founder and CEO of Equuleus Corp, said activities at her toptier Equuleus International Riding Club in Beijing were suspended at the end of January in line with the antiepidemic measures.During the outbreak, the club also strengthened employees wellbeing and site management according to public health regulations, she said.Due to the special nature of the equestrian industry, even if offline activities were suspended amid COVID, the care of horses and the management of the stables cannot be separated from people, Wang said.There were still many of her colleagues who stayed in the front line while employees who had taken leave to go home continued to work with the company online. All of them stood ready to resume production at any time, said Wang, whose group has been held up as a sport industry model.During the epidemic, Wangs club used the latest communications technologies to develop online courses.

We know the measures to take to prevent any fallout from the outbreak and all of us are now raring to go, said Liu, , who hosts about  to  riders on busy weekends.
