General Secretary Xi Jinping, putting the health and safety of our people before everything else, has personally taken charge and planned our response. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the central leading group for covid response has made timely decisions and plans the central guidance group has provided effective guidance and supervision the State Council interdepartmental task force has coordinated the response efforts all local authorities and all government departments have fulfilled their respective duties, and people from every walk of life have given their full support. Together, we have waged an allout peoples war against the virus. Our medical workers have fought with courage. Our servicemen and women have shouldered heavy responsibilities. Our scientists and researchers have joined forces in order to find a cure. Our community workers, policemen and women, officials working at the primary level, media personnel, and volunteers have stood fast at their posts. Our deliverymen and women, our sanitation workers, and all who make and transport emergency supplies have continued their work with dedication. Hundreds of millions of other workers outside of the spotlight have also made their own contributions. In Wuhan City and Hubei Province the people have carried on with fortitude and resilience, while people from all sectors of society and our fellow compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and overseas have made generous donations, both monetary and inkind. Through all these efforts, we, all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, have stood together in the most trying of times and built a Great Wall of solidarity against the epidemic.?Responding to the central Party leaderships call to stay confident, come together in solidarity, adopt a sciencebased approach, and take targeted measures, we have carried out all our work in a solid and meticulous manner. We adopted containment measures promptly, treating covid as a Class A infectious disease and activating a Level One public health emergency response in all localities. We have achieved a decisive victory in the battle to defend Hubei Province and its capital city Wuhan by firmly implementing strict control measures, rallying the support of the entire country, and dispatching over , doctors and nurses. We built Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals as well as cabin hospitals to increase the number of hospital beds within a short time, and ensured the availability of medical supplies. We continuously refined diagnostic and treatment plans, incorporated traditional Chinese medicine into treatment, and concentrated patients, experts and resources in designated facilities to provide treatment, thus doing everything we could to maximize the cure rate and minimize the mortality rate. We extended the Spring Festival holiday nationwide, postponed the spring semester, facilitated flexible resumption of work, and staggered commute times. We have carried out a societywide prevention and control effort, ensured early detection, reporting, quarantine, and treatment of cases, firmly controlled sources of infection, and effectively curbed the spread of the virus. Intensive efforts have been made to develop drugs, vaccines, and testing reagents. We expanded production of medical supplies by a large margin within a short time, ensured supply and price stability of daily necessities, and maintained smooth transportation on trunk lines, as well as stable supplies of coal, electricity, oil, and gas. In response to changing covid dynamics, we have adopted regular prevention and control measures in a timely manner. In the face of the global spread of covid, we promptly set up a shield against possible imported cases, and we have provided increased care and support for Chinese citizens overseas. With an open, transparent, and responsible attitude, China has actively engaged in international cooperation, providing timely information, actively sharing prevention technologies and practices, and helping other countries with their response efforts.As a developing country with . billion people, it is only by overcoming enormous difficulties that China has been able to contain covid in such a short time while also ensuring our peoples basic needs. Our success has come at a great price. The economy posted negative growth in the first quarter of this year, and daily life and work have been greatly affected. However, life is invaluable.

These policies have benefited our people, and ensured the stability of supplies and prices and the resumption of work and production in a timely and effective way.

On behalf of the State Council, I express sincere gratitude to the people of all ethnic groups, and to all other political parties, peoples organizations, and public figures from all sectors of society. I express heartfelt appreciation to our fellow countrymen and women in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, in Taiwan, and overseas. I also express sincere thanks to the governments of other countries, international organizations, and friends from all over the world, who have shown understanding and support for China in its endeavor to achieve modernization and in its fight against covid.?While recognizing our achievements, we are also keenly aware of the difficulties and problems we face. The shock of the covid pandemic has sent the world economy into severe recession, disrupted industrial and supply chains, and caused a contraction in international trade and investment and volatility in commodity markets. Domestically, consumption, investment, and exports have declined. Pressure on employment has risen significantly. Businesses, especially private firms and micro, small, and medium enterprises MSMEs, face growing difficulties. There are increasing risks in the financial sector and other areas. The budgetary imbalances of primarylevel governments have intensified.In the work of government there is still room for improvement. Pointless formalities and bureaucratism remain an acute issue. A small number of officials are reluctant to take on responsibility, are unwilling or unable to perform their duties, or behave irresponsibly. Corruption is still a common problem in some fields. During the covid response, many weak links have been exposed in public health emergency management, and the people have expressed their views and suggestions, which deserve our attention. We must strive to improve our work and fulfill our responsibilities and make every effort to live up to the peoples expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ??
