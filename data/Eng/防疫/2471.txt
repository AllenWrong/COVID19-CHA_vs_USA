The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said at a news conference that the daily production volume of domestic protective suit makers has exceeded demand in Central Chinas Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, in the past dozens of days. But the supply of protective suits is still tight, and companies should not relax their minds, said Cao Xuejun, deputy director of the ministrys Consumer Products Industry Department. Cao said the ministry will guide protective suit makers to increase their flexible production capabilities and manufacture their products according to demand. Meanwhile, as some foreign countries are faced with a shortage of epidemic prevention goods, China will encourage domestic protective suit makers to actively meet the surging demand from overseas regions, Cao added.
