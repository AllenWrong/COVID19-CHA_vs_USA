CPC strives to ensure no one gets left behind on the path to become a modern, prosperous socialist country                                             A patchwork of wooden ladders that rose precariously up the steep side of a mountain used to be the only link between Mose Lazuos village, perched on a ,meterhigh cliff, and the world outside. For Mose and the other children living in Atuleer, a village in Zhaojue county, Liangshan Yi autonomous prefecture in Sichuan province, navigating the steep cliffs via the ladders was the only way to get to school and then go back home, a trip that was exhausting, often treacherous, and at times fatal. Moses family, who have lived in the cliffside village for generations, delayed her attendance in primary school until she was , when they believed she was capable of making the trip. Even then her father tied a rope around his waist and hers to ensure her safety. The lack of convenient access to the outside world also defined the villagers subsistence living, as most residents would only travel outside once a week to obtain basic necessities and sell crops such as Sichuan peppercorns and walnuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
