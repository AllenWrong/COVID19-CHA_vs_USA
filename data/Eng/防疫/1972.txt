Diverging perspectives on COVID and the elderly
2020-09-18 07:48
It is patently clear that the COVID pandemic has severely affected older persons. Less robust physically, they are more prone to infection and the symptoms arising have typically been more serious  often gravely so. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States highlights on their website that Eight out of ten COVIDrelated deaths reported in the United States have been among adults aged  years and older. We have seen reports from around the world, including Australia, Canada, the US, the United Kingdom and the European Union detailing the devastating effects of COVID infections within Long Term Care homes for older folk. We initially avoided this impact in Hong Kong but have more recently seen limited but still depressing mortality figures within LTC facilities following the latest COVID spike. There is commentary, both thoughtful and more radical, that what we should bear in mind that COVID deaths may well be displacing likely imminent deaths from other causes, in older victims. Still, according to the Daily Mirror in the UK, a detailed study provided by the University of Glasgow, drawing on data from Italy, estimated that Years of Life Lost after taking into account underlying existing chronic illnesses averaged over  years per person. The YLL impact of COVID was comparable, the study argued, to that which would be expected from a major uplift in the rate of coronary heart disease. Professor Daniel Bell from Shandong University observed in an interview in May that, The Confucian value of filial piety, or reverence for the elderly, helps in part to explain why East Asian countries took such strong measures to protect people from a disease that is particularly dangerous for the elderly. It is increasingly evident that East Asian societies have done notably better than most other jurisdictions in containing the spread of COVID infections. Bell contrasts this focus with the prioritizing of individual autonomy which, more than ever, lies at the core of socialcomprehension across most advanced Western nations. One British writer, Theodore Dalrymple, captured this actuality with the observation that so many today, in such societies, consider themselves to be the Sun King of their own soul. Early in September, World Health Organization DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus took a strong position objecting to the view that high COVID death rates for the elderly were not a major concern Accepting someone to die because of age is moral bankruptcy at its highest, and we should not allow our society to behave this way. At about the same time, former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott offered an alternative view. Mr Abbott said, according to The Guardian, that Health Dictatorships were failing to consider the economic costs of the crisis and that some elderly COVID patients should be allowed to die naturally. Mr Abbott stressed how costly it was to maintain certain lives and he cast serious doubt on the wisdom of striving to achieve very low or zero transmission rates.There is another facet of this aged COVID victim reality, which has received scant examination due to its sensitivity, but which still remains in plain sight. Mr Abbotts view tends to draw attention to this aspect of the COVID impact. Outside of these LTC homes there are children and other relatives, many of whom will be entitled as beneficiaries, upon the death of those living in such facilities. Moreover, the assets of the LTC resident, which will comprise the ultimate estate, are often a primary source of payment of LTC fees. In such cases, the longer the period of such care, the less will be the amount available to be inherited. The hard fact is that, although most will not welcome the COVID pandemic in any overt way, a number of beneficiaries, not least in the individualized West, may see an earlier death in these circumstances as not all bad news. China was, of course, the first responder to the COVID pandemic. It struggled, initially, to cope with a disease never before encountered. Yet it learned remarkably quickly how best to respond. The solutionfocus swiftly and radically moved to containing and controlling the spread of the virus  and to saving lives, above all. This imposed conspicuously stringent personal controls and, as The Times in London recently reported, it initially effectively stopped economic activity. However, as the same report highlighted, these powerful disease control measures laid the foundations for an early normalization of production with Chinese exports posting their strongest growth in  months in August. China now has a firmly advancing economy. This is a postCOVID outcome unmatched by any other major market. China thus confirms that the best economic response to the epidemic is also the most lifesaving and humanitarian  provided governing circumstances and the quality of governance create this option and wellresourced, scientifically informed decisiveness prevails. As it happens, the businesslike advice offered by Mr Abbott indirectly confirms this. His sharp realism is distinctly influenced by the experience of jurisdictions where infection numbers have accelerated and sometimes soared, despite local efforts to test, contain and control. Where, as has regularly been the case, such measures have not been robustly effective, the COVID pandemic has caused increasingly acute economic stress. Mr Abbotts remedial approach is a policy molded by a certain degree of locally shaped desperation.The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.       ?                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
