In all ports of the city, Shenzhen Customs has installed infrared body temperature monitoring equipment, which covers all passenger channels. Once it detects fever in passengers, it sets off an alarm. Meanwhile, to prevent the epidemic from spreading from ports, Shenzhen Customs has taken a series of measures that strengthens sanitary quarantine of vehicles, requires drivers and passengers to report their health conditions, jointly conducts onsite inspections of passengers with medical staff, and sterilizes public area in ports. More than  additional officers were sent to support frontline epidemic prevention at different ports in the city. In the past few days, many officers skipped their Spring Festival holiday, and took the initiative to work extra hours at their posts. As such, Shenzhen Customs officers have formed a strong line of defense in protecting peoples health against the epidemic with their professionalism, dedication and tenderness.
