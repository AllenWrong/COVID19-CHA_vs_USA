BEIJING  China firmly opposes any form of official exchanges between the United States and Taiwan, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Thursday, adding that some US politicians would pay a heavy price for their wrongdoings concerning Chinas Taiwan region.Spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks at a daily press briefing when responding to a question about US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft, who held talks with Taiwan leader Tsai Ingwen via video link on Thursday.Crafts words and deeds interfere in Chinas internal affairs, gravely violate the oneChina principle and the three ChinaUS joint communiques, and go against the US political commitment on the Taiwan question. China firmly opposes this, Zhao said.There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory, Zhao said. The government of the Peoples Republic of China is the sole legal government representing China. This fact is recognized by the international community and a basic principle governing international relations, he said.The United Nations consists of sovereign states. The participation of Chinas Taiwan region in international organizations, including the World Health Organization WHO, must be handled under the oneChina principle, Zhao said, adding that it is also an important principle recognized in the UN General Assembly Resolution  and the World Health Assembly Resolution ..The central government of China attaches great importance to the health and wellbeing of Taiwan compatriots. Since the outbreak of COVID, we have repeatedly and timely informed Taiwan region of the latest epidemic prevention and control developments, and made appropriate arrangements for Taiwans participation in global health affairs, he said.There is an International Health Regulations Contact Point in the Taiwan region, and its exchange of information with the WHO and other countries is smooth, Zhao added.The US should abide by the oneChina principle and the three ChinaUS joint communiques, and stop interfering in Chinas internal affairs and undermining ChinaUS relations, Zhao said.China will continue to take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty and security interests. Some US politicians will surely pay a heavy price for their wrongdoings, he added.
