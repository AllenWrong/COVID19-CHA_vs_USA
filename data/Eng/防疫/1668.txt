Speaking at a press conference of the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council in Beijing, Lin Wei, an official with the General Administration of Customs, said one of the measures is requiring all entryexit people to submit declaration of health to screen people with epidemic symptoms. According to Lin, entryexit personnel can submit their declarations of health through mini mobile programs and obtain QR codes before they arrive at the port. Anyone entering or exiting the ports should have their temperatures checked and strict inspections will be carried out on people with symptoms, those from regions severely hit by virus and those who have contact with confirmed patients, he said.
