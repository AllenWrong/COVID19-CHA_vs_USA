Anyone who violates or impairs inspection and quarantine measures at Chinese ports or after they enter the countrywhether Chinese nationals or foreign citizenswill be held liable in accordance with Chinese laws, top judicial authorities said on Tuesday. The Supreme Peoples Court and the Supreme Peoples Procuratorate issued the clarification as the country sees a rising risk of imported infections of the novel coronavirus. Authorities have listed six behaviors that could constitute the crime of impairing frontier quarantine measures in a guideline targeting individuals who spread or risk spreading an infectious disease identified by the Chinese State Council, including plague, cholera, yellow fever and COVID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
