Trump says he would be signing executive order for the suspension                    President Donald Trump pledged a temporary ban on immigration to the United States because of the invisible enemy of coronavirus, as the disease sparked angry street demonstrations to demand an end to crippling lockdowns. In just four months, the virus has turned the world upside down, confining half the planet indoors and killing more than , on its march through virtually every country. Drastic measures never before seen in peacetime have shredded the global economy, resulting in the extraordinary spectacle of oil prices turning negative as demand evaporates. World leaders are agonizing over when to loosen restrictions, terrified of a second wave but aware their citizens need to work and live amid growing signs of social tension. Trump, who has encouraged antilockdown protests roiling parts of the country, said Monday he would halt immigration, a theme long popular with his supporters. In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States! he tweeted. At least  million jobs have been lost in the US since sweeping lockdowns were implemented to slow the spread of the virus. South Carolina on Monday allowed some businesses to reopen and two other southern states planned the same, while some governors warned that testing for the virus remained inadequate to quickly identify and contain new outbreaks. Trump said at a White House briefing Monday that he was working with governors to make sure they had the resources needed to ramp up testing and added that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo would visit the White House to discuss the response to the pandemic. US VicePresident Mike Pence attempted to reassure governors on Monday in a call that the federal government was working as quickly as possible to get states coronavirus testing supplies. More tests needed There are currently about , diagnostic tests conducted daily, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Researchers at Harvard estimated last week that to ease restrictions, the nation needed to at least triple the pace of testing. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said Monday that his state acquired , test kits enough to run , tests over the weekend from South Korean company LabGenomics for about  million. But Hogan, a Republican and president of the National Governors Association, and Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, said they dont have the testing capability to open their economies. The administration made it clear over and over again they want the states to take the lead, Hogan said at a news conference Monday. And so thats exactly what we did. We are fighting a biological war, Northam said. We have been asked as governors to fight that war without the supplies we need. Northam and other governors said they need more swabs and reagents required for the test. New York, the state suffering the most from the virus, began tests Monday. The New York tests are looking for coronavirus antibodies in bloodsigns that a person has fought off an infection, which could be present even if that person doesnt appear ill. The state plans to initially test , people chosen randomly. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster allowed some businesses to open Monday, including retail shops ranging from department stores to flea markets shortly after he signed an executive order reversing some of the closings he ordered earlier this month. On Friday, residents of Georgia will be allowed to return to the gym and get haircuts, pedicures, massages and tattoos, Governor Brian Kemp said. On the economic front, US crude oil prices dropped by almost  percent Monday, turning negative for the first time on record. Trump said his administration was looking at the possibility of stopping incoming Saudi Arabian crude oil shipments as a measure to support the battered domestic drilling industry. WHO working with CDC The World Health Organization confirmed on Monday that it has been working very closely with US COVID experts since the beginning of the outbreak, a rebuke to Trumps claim that the WHO did not inform the US of the threat in a timely fashion. WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the comment when asked about a Washington Post report on Sunday that US citizens working at the WHO transmitted realtime information about the virus to the Trump administration. More than a dozen US researchers, physicians, and public health experts, many of them from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were working fulltime at the Geneva headquarters of the WHO as the novel coronavirus emerged late last year and transmitted realtime information about its discovery and spread in China to the Trump administration, the Post reported, quoting US and international officials. A number of CDC staff members are regularly detailed to work at the WHO in Geneva as part of a rotation, something that has operated for years. Senior Trumpappointed health officials also consulted regularly at the highest levels with the WHO as the crisis unfolded, the officials told the Post. Tedros described the WHOs relationship with the CDC as long standing and praised the US institution as a model for the world and for helping the WHO. But, at the same time, having CDC staff means that there is nothing hidden from the US from Day One, he said during a virtual news conference from Geneva. Trump has repeatedly accused the WHO of failing to communicate the extent of the threat posed by COVID and announced last week he was halting US funding to the global health body. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said the WHO has  US government representatives embedded with it on COVID since Jan , and added that there are two permanent US colleagues on his program, working specially on influenza and epidemic readiness. Ryan emphasized that since Jan , the WHO has had  details from the CDC on COVID, meaning that  CDC staff have been detailed specifically to work with the WHO on COVID. Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead of the Health Emergencies Programme and a US epidemiologist, said working with colleagues from CDC and the National Institute of Health in the US and academic partners was very usual for us.
