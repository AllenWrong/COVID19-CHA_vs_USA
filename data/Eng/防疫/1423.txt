PhotoPOWERCHINAAfter two hours of careful debugging, the first stator frame section of the No  hydrogenerator unit on the left bank of Baihetan Hydropower Station was hoisted into place.It was fitted by the Sinohydro Engineering Bureau No  Co, a subsidiary of POWERCHINA, marking the start of the installation of the worlds largest single capacity  million kw unit.The stator frame is composed of nine sections. The outer diameter of the frame is , millimeters, and the upper and lower ring plates have a total of nine layers, of which four upper ring plates are nonmagnetic steel structures.The inner diameter of the ring plate of layer one, from the lower end to the upper end of the frame, is , mm. The inner diameter of ring plate of layer two to layer nine is , mm. The clear height of the frame is , mm.?Since the start of the mechanical and electrical installation project on the left bank of Baihetan Hydropower Station in the second half of , Sinohydro Bureau No  has faced severe issues of tight construction schedules and huge construction challenges.A worker directs the hoisting.
