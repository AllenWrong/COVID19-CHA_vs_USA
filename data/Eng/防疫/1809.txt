In common with the rest of the sports world, Chinas League of Legends Pro League LPL was forced to hit the pause button when it temporarily suspended the action in February. Nicolo Laurent, the CEO of Riot Games, which developed LOL, admitted this year has been a crazy journey but lavished praise on local organizers, saying Chinas successful control of the epidemic was crucial to the world championship not falling victim to the pandemic. The uncertainty of the pandemic, sports shutting down around the world, many events canceled and full seasons entirely postponedbut during all that time, League of Legends esports proved its resilience, said Laurent, who had to go through a strict epidemic prevention process to enter China. We needed to take extreme measures to make sure the show is safe. Safety is the priority. We got a lot of help related to COVID testing, quarantine measures and daily bodytemperature checks. There are also many safety procedures inside the venue. The city of Shanghai has offered immense help to make sure this happened. Welcoming the elite players and league staff from across the globe was another logistical challenge for organizers. The foreign teams made it to Shanghai in late September, when they were all subject to nucleic acid tests and a day isolation period. Throughout the group and knockout stages, teams stayed in designated hotels where frequent medical testing was conducted. There wasnt much to do to pass the time in the hotel. Mostly we trained. Sometimes I would watch shows online or go to the gym, said Hong Haoxuan, aka Karsa, of TopEsports, which fell  to Suning Gaming SN in the semifinals. Due to the pandemic, the matches before the final were staged behind closed doors. For some of the younger players of our team, it was their first time playing in the world championship. But its a pity that there were no fans cheering for us. John Needham, Riot Games global head of esports, was among the foreigners who had to observe the epidemic protocols upon entering China. He praised the process as smooth and comfortable. I want to thank the Shanghai local governmentWe have our own medical staff at the hotel testing us and keeping us safe. We have a lot of protocols in terms of the players travel, but so far its been great here, said Needham. The success of this years worlds is framed against a backdrop of a booming Chinese esports market. According to the  Global Esports Development Report published by Tencent Esports and Penguin Intelligence, the number of Chinese gamers and esports fans reached  million in , with that number projected to reach  million by the end of . The Chinese esports market was valued at . billion yuan  billion in . In , there were only about , people working in Chinas esports sector, but last year employers could not fill all of the , vacancies due to a talent vacuum, illustrating the industrys huge potential. If you asked me  years ago, my answer would be South Korea was the crystal ball of global esports, said Laurent. I think now China is taking over. From the market perspective, China is making a lot of policies and investment, and it really understands that the future of sports lies in esports. Last year I was in Paris for the  world championship final. When I met the local officials there, they all asked me to tell them how they do it in China. I think China is now taking the lead.
