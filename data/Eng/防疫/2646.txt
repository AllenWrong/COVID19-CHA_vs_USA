State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the Highlevel Video Conference on Belt and Road International Cooperation in the AsiaPacific on Wednesday.Focusing on COVID prevention and control cooperation in the region and the regions economic recovery, the conference provided a platform for the representatives of more than  countries and international organizations to pool their wisdom in addressing the challenges the region faces.In all,  countries and  international organizations are participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, highlighting the great significance attached to it. With plentiful substantial achievements having been made since it was proposed in , the initiative has provided the world with many global public products that manifest practical progress toward the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has served to highlight the initiatives practical benefits, as it has prompted countries to work together to protect public health and promote common development. Not only are essential medical supplies provided under the framework through mutual assistance programs but also the participants have never ceased their intensive exchanges on epidemic prevention and control work, and macro policy coordination. That demonstrates the vitality of the Belt and Road Initiative, which is an open and inclusive multilateral platform.As Wang proposed in the conference, the quality of Belt and Road cooperation projects will be higher in the future, and although infrastructure constructions remain crucial, more attention will be paid to strengthen public health collaboration and ensure the reliability and security of supply chains, and enhance cooperation in innovation, technology and green development.The active responses these proposals have received from the other participants in the conference reflect that they are highly consistent with the appeals of all countries in the region, which are looking to get their socioeconomic development back on the right track at an early date, build more responsive and efficient public health systems, and develop new growth engines through international cooperation.Unlike the Build Back Better World initiative the United States proposed at the G Summit earlier this month, the Belt and Road Initiative starts from the practical needs of the participants rather than any single countrys geopolitical ambitions. Functioning on the basis of joint construction, collective consultation and benefit sharing, instead of one participant telling the others what to do, it produces tangible benefits for the people.It is the common will of the people in the region working together for a better world that enables the Belt and Road Initiative to stand the tests of such grave challenges as the COVID pandemic, and continuously demonstrate robust vitality and strong adaptability.
