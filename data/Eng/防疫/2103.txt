Contain the epidemic with collective efforts
2020-02-13 08:28
Latest figures released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention early on Wednesday showed that the number of newly confirmed COVID cases, suspected cases, and deaths from the epidemic around the country continued to fall by the end of Tuesday while the number of fully recovered patients kept growing. However, the nationwide battle against the deadly scourge is far from over and requires collective efforts by all members of the public, including those in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, to achieve ultimate victory. It is safe to say that Hong Kong residents who experienced the fight against the SARS epidemic of  are no stranger to this kind of peoples war and need no prodding to cooperate unless one has ulterior motives to undermine the SAR government at Hong Kong societys expense. All known pandemics and epidemics in human history ran their course until mankind figured out ways to minimize their devastation andor became immune to the pathogens. Right now, roughly . billion mainland compatriots are contributing to the nationwide campaign led by the central government to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, in whatever way they can. The least that . million Hong Kong residents can do for their own sake is make conscientious efforts to avoid infection according to expert advice and government rules, beginning with faithfully observing a mandatory selfquarantine for at least  days by all those who have returned recently from the mainland  and especially Hubei province. Quarantine is the most effective way to stop any contagion from spreading in densely populated communities found everywhere in Hong Kong. The SAR government has left no stone unturned in finding appropriate sites for quarantine purposes. But its efforts have been compromised by strong opposition from neighboring local residents who are enslaved by the not in my backyard mindset. This harmful mindset must be overcome if we are to win over the fight against the virus sooner rather than later. Every resident can also contribute to the eventual victory against the virus by strictly observing recommended protection measures, such as staying away from crowded venues as much as possible always wearing a face mask in public places and avoiding unnecessary gatherings to minimize the risk of infection.In addition to personal protection measures, employers are encouraged to help their employees by letting them work from home whenever possible. This is obviously a practical way to kill two birds with one stone minimizing the odds of employees catching the coronavirus in public transportation or the office, while helping mitigate the severe shortage of surgical masks in the city. Landlords also have a role to play in easing the woes of the community in this difficult time. They should seriously consider giving their commercial tenants  particularly small businesses  a rent reduction if not a break, which is crucial to the survival of small businesses, whose operations have been hardhit first by the monthslong violent campaign and then by the coronavirus. Hong Kong is wellknown for innovative talents, whose ingenuity is now needed more than ever in the battle to stop the spread of the COVID epidemic in its tracks. There is no better way to prove ones humanity and integrity than by contributing to the wellbeing of ones own community as a whole instead of fueling mass panic or noncooperation for political profit.       ?                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
