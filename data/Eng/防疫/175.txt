?        White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah Birx speaks during the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington, April , . PhotoAgencies    In a news conference on Saturday, Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, compared the number of deaths per , people caused by the virus in various countries  . in Belgium, . in Spain, . in Italy, . in the United States, . in Germany, and . in China, to quote some  and implied that while the US has done a good job doctoring its patients, China has doctored its statistics. The logic applied to try and prove that conclusion was these countries are developed countries, while China is a developing one, so given the discrepancy in mortality rates Chinas statistics cannot be true. But the low fatality rate in China is because it locked down Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and epicenter of the pandemic in the country, and concentrated its national resources on the city. The rest of the Hubei province was locked down soon after Wuhan in order to provide a buffer zone. With a population of . million, similar to the . million of Belgium, Wuhan boasted of , sickbeds and , medics at the peak of the pandemic, with  temporary hospitals put into operation, which made the responsiveness and coverage of its medical care system in the city similar to the aforementioned developed countries. Even with the concentration of resources, the number of deaths per , residents in Wuhan is ., similar to the worsthit developed countries in Europe. Chinas relatively low national mortality rate is because Wuhan bore the brunt of the pandemic. As of Tuesday, Wuhan accounted for  percent of the national death toll. That the same medical teams from around the country that went to fight on the front line in Wuhan are now strengthening the defense against imported cases in the northeast of the country shows that if the decision had not been made to lock down Wuhan and fight the virus there, the countrys medical system would have been swiftly overwhelmed. That the total number of infections in China is nine times less than the number in the US, is because the authorities acted quickly and decisively when the speed of transmission became clear. As a medical expert overseeing the US governments billions of dollars spending on epidemic control and prevention, Birx is no doubt aware of how unfounded the charges against China are. She should also realize how reprehensible it is to politicize the loss of lives in this way. The US administration usually offers neither witness nor proof when subjecting China to its calumnies one can see why. In attempting to use data to support its censuring of Chinas pandemic control efforts, it has instead highlighted how effective those measures have been.
