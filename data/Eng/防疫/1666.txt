Gao Gao, deputy secretarygeneral of the NDRC, expressed confidence that the coronavirus epidemic will not alter sound fundamentals of Chinas longterm economy. The Chinese economy enjoys solid resilience, potential and flexibility, Gao said We have full confidence and tools to prevail over the epidemic, stabilize the economy, keep stable level of employment and foster highquality development. Despite Chinas effective efforts of epidemic control and prevention, the spread of the virus across the globe makes it difficult to predict the magnitude of its impact on both China and the global economy. Gao told a news conference in Beijing, adding that theres tough work ahead. To better deal with the epidemics impact, the government has rolled out a series of measures, such as cutting taxes and fees and offering financial support, to ensure the orderly resumption of work and keep employment stable. In the next step, the country will offer subsidy for small and mediumsized companies that recruit new graduates and encourage Stateowned companies to hire more graduates for two consecutive years. And the country will ramp up efforts to help migrant works return to work, giving priority to those living in hardship.
