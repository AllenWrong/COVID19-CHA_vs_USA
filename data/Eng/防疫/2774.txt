Medical workers cheer for each other in the ICU intensive care unit of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, central Chinas Hubei Province, Jan. , . XinhuaXiong Qi    Editors Note Two China Daily readers studying in Wuhan voiced their support to China in its fight against the novel coronavirus epidemic. I am from Nepal, currently studying in Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease outbreak. Since the outbreak, the Chinese government is making unprecedented efforts to prevent and control it. The safety of the people is given higher priority, and top priority is given to the protection of international students. However, some countries have evacuated their citizens from Wuhan, preventing possible transmission. But, I have decided should stay in Wuhan, I should not abandon people of the Wuhan at this distressing time, and I should unite with people of the Wuhan to win the battle against the CoViD. I learned many things in Wuhan and experienced more than my expectations in Wuhan. China provided a learning platform for me with warm hospitality. So, how can I abort this hospitality at this juncture that China is fighting against the CoViD? I have confidence that China is capable of overcoming this crisis. I request the rest of the world to fight shoulder to shoulder against the CoViD instead of spreading rumors. I am with China I am with Wuhan I pray for China I pray for Wuhan. Whn ji yu! Zhng gu ji yu! Jham Kumar Bishwakarma
