ASIANS BATTLE OUTBREAK OF US XENOPHOBIA
2020-02-17 00:00
Racial prejudice rears its ugly head                    As China races to contain the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak and minimize the international spread, Chinese living abroad are battling stigma and discrimination. In the United States, only  cases of infection from the virus have been confirmed and the immediate risk to the public remains low. But false health information has circulated, including warnings to avoid Asian food and Asianpopulated areas. A barrage of vicious comments and derogatory jokes about Chinese or Asians in general has also gathered steam online. Former US ambassador to China Gary Locke said, These negative, uninformed comments only stress the need for US public health officials and government leaders to do a better job of educating the public about the virus, how it is spread and how to protect themselves. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stressed that there is no need for people to fear Asians in their community. Its unfortunate. It really saddens me to hear these stories, she said. Marybeth Sexton, assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, said, All of the infected patients are either isolated at home or hospitalized, and public health officials are closely monitoring anyone else who is at high risk of having had exposure. Theres no reason to assume that anyone you meet in public, of any ethnic or racial background, poses a risk to you. It is critical that the US public guards against any xenophobia surrounding the outbreak and lets common sense prevail, as urged by officials, doctors, entrepreneurs and experts at the CDC, she said. Observers said the virus of misinformation and disinformation, which might be used to spread xenophobia, could pose a greater danger than the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak itself, and concern over public health should not justify any antiAsian racism. Stereotyping fight During a news conference on the outbreak, UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres said, Its easy to move into ... perspectives in which there tends to be discrimination there tends to be violation of human rights there tends to be stigma on innocent people just because of their ethnicity. In recent weeks, an yearold boy from Washington state, who was wearing a medical mask, was told by a worker at a sample stand in a Costco outlet to go away because he may have come from China, while students at Columbia University in New York were welcomed by a Chineselanguage message reading, Wuhan virus isolation area. The health services center at the University of California at Berkeley listed xenophobia toward Asians as a normal reaction in an Instagram post on managing fear and anxiety about the outbreak videos of Asians eating bats accompanied by inaccurate speculation about the cause of the virus and dehumanizing comments went viral and The Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece titled China is the Real Sick Man of Asia. Reports of such racist incidents have sparked public outcry, prompting many to speak out and action to be taken. Costco has since apologized to the boy and his family Columbia University has called on students to report any racist incidents UCBerkeley has revised its handout, which now reads, Be mindful of your assumptions about others and Selfawareness is important in not stigmatizing others in our community. The bateating video was shot on the Pacific island nation of Palau, where the dish is a delicacy and social media users have accused The Wall Street Journal article of resurrecting an archaic stereotype while making light of a serious outbreak. An online petition, demanding an apology from the newspaper to the Chinese community and either a retraction of the article or a rectification of the headline raised more than , signatures in just days. Meanwhile, Peter Koo, a New York City Council member for an area that includes Flushing, where more than onethird of the , residents are Chinese Americans, warned against calling the virus Wuhan coronavirus or China coronavirus. Viruses are colorblind. Naming a virus after a country or a city is an unfair insult that exacerbates discrimination against people from China, Koo said. Understanding needed A recent video on Twitter showed a man attacking an Asian woman wearing a mask at a subway station in Manhattan, New York, while cursing her and shouting, Dont touch me! The man called her diseased, according to Tony He, a New York resident who posted the video. Asians often wear face masks for protection from germs, allergies and dust. Since the viral outbreak, many Chinese living abroad have been wearing surgical masks in public areas, but few people foresaw that this could heighten fear and generate dislike among the US public. Koo said his office has received complaints from parents whose children are bullied when they wear masks at school, adding that while many people might only wear them when they are sick, they should not stigmatize Asians for doing so. I hope Americans will understand that when Asians wear face masks, it does not mean they are sick. But it takes time and education to change cultural perceptions, he said. Koos deputy chief of staff, Scott Sieber, who has years of experience working in Asian communities, said he appreciates Chinese wearing face masks. He said this indicates that people are taking precautions and looking after those around them, adding, I understand this, as I am familiar with the culture. The CDC and doctors in general believe there is no need to wear masks in the US, but are urging people to wash their hands often and avoid going out in public when they become sick. But Locke, who used to be governor of Washington state and is a former US secretary of commerce, said the CDC is only making a recommendation, not a requirement or a law. Americans in general, and the Chinese community in particular, are free to do as they wish, without any repercussions, he added. Charlie Woo, cofounder and CEO of toy manufacturing company Megatoys in Los Angeles, called on Asian Americans to continue explaining that they are not sick just because they are wearing a mask. If any Asian feels more comfortable wearing a mask, he or she has every right to do so, said Woo, who is also vicechair of the Committee of , a group comprising leading Chinese Americans striving to ensure full inclusion in the country and to advance USChina relations. The United States has had racial issues since the beginning. Hopefully, we make progress one day at a time, he said. Chinatowns still safe Angela Wang, the owner of a decadeold hair salon in Flushing, said onethird of her regular customers used to be nonChinese, but two days after her employees started wearing masks, these clients all stopped returning. There has also been a significant drop in the number of her Chinese customers. All of us have taken off the masks, but our business has declined by  percent in the past week. If customers are not coming back and rents are not going down, we might have to shut down within two months, said Wang, who arrived in the US  years ago from Zhejiang province. Her salon is just one of many businesses struggling financially in Flushing. A sales manager at a spacious dim sum restaurant believed the outbreak could deal the neighborhood its heaviest blow for many years. Amid fears of business slowing down in Chinatowns and Asian communities such as Flushing, city officials have told people not to change their daytoday activities. Mark Treyger, a New York City Council member, tweeted Stick to the facts about coronavirus by getting your info from trained medical professionals and reliable sources. Basic hygiene rules apply. Call out hate when you see it, and continue to shop, dine and go about your normal everyday routine. New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot took the initiative to frequent Chinese restaurants, attend celebrations in Chinatown and share all her experiences on Twitter. Ive been disheartened by reports of bias and discrimination against the Asian community recently. Let me be clearour public health response is about a virus, not a group of people, she tweeted, along with a picture of her and two others dining at a Chinese restaurant. During Spring Festival, she tweeted Today, our city is celebrating the Lunar New Year parade in Chinatown, a beautiful cultural tradition with a rich history in the city. I want to remind everyone to enjoy the parade and not change any plans due to misinformation spreading about coronavirus. Flu a bigger threat The CDC and the Chinese government have joined hands for the past  years to address public health priorities affecting the two countries and the world, according to Barbara Marston, head of the international coronavirus task force at the CDCs Center for Global Health. While the epidemic continues to dominate headlines, officials and doctors have reminded the US public that influenza poses a bigger threat. Koo said that in New York, where there have been no confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia, there is a much higher chance of becoming sick from flu. Sexton, from Emory University School of Medicine, said Getting a flu vaccine is very helpful. If people are sick with respiratory symptoms, they should put on a mask in a healthcare waiting room to avoid infecting others. The CDC estimates that, so far this season, flu has caused at least  million cases of illness, , hospitalizations and , deaths. In a recent interview with The Boston Globe, Paul Watanabe, director of the Institute for Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said, AntiChinese racism centered around the coronavirus outbreak isnt just ugly, its illogical. The fact of the matter is we are facing a health crisis right now in the United States. Its a domestic one and its the flu. ? ?
