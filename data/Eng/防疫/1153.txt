PhotoXinhua    ROME  With confirmed coronavirus cases in the US hitting  million Sunday, by far the highest of any country, the failure of the most powerful nation in the world to contain the scourge has been met with astonishment and alarm in Europe. Perhaps nowhere outside the US is Americas bungled virus response viewed with more consternation than in Italy, which was ground zero of Europes epidemic. Italians were unprepared when the outbreak exploded in February, and the country still has one of the worlds highest official death tolls at over ,. But after a strict nationwide, week lockdown, vigilant tracing of new clusters and general acceptance of mask mandates and social distancing, Italy has become a model of virus containment. Dont they care about their health? a maskclad Patrizia Antonini asked about people in the United States as she walked with friends along the banks of Lake Bracciano, north of Rome. They need to take our precautions. ... They need a real lockdown. Much of the incredulity in Europe stems from the fact that America had the benefit of time, European experience and medical knowhow to treat the virus that the continent itself didnt have when the first COVID patients started filling intensive care units. More than four months into a sustained outbreak, the US reached the  million mark, according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Health officials believe the actual number is perhaps  times higher, or closer to  million, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as  percent of all those who are infected have no symptoms. We Italians always saw America as a model, said Massimo Franco, a columnist with daily Corriere della Sera. But with this virus weve discovered a country that is very fragile, with bad infrastructure and a public health system that is nonexistent. With Americas worldshighest death toll of more than ,, its politicized resistance to masks and its rising caseload, European nations have barred American tourists and visitors from other countries with growing cases from freely traveling to the bloc. ?

I am very well aware that this impinges on individual freedoms, but I believe that this is a justifiable intervention, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said last week. Mistakes were made in Europe, too, from delayed lockdowns to insufficient protections for nursing home elderly and critical shortages of tests and protective equipment for medical personnel. Hardhit Spain, France, Britain and Germany have seen infection rebounds with new cases topping , a day, and Italys cases went over  on Friday. Some scientists say Britains beloved pubs might have to close again if schools are to reopen in September. Europe as a whole has seen over , confirmed virus deaths, by Johns Hopkins count. In the US, new cases are running at about , a day  an immensely high number even when taking into account the countrys large population. And while thats down from a peak of well over , last month, cases are rising in nearly  states, and deaths are climbing in most. In contrast, at least for now Europe appears to have the virus somewhat under control. Had the medical professionals been allowed to operate in the States, you would have belatedly gotten to a point of getting to grips with this back in March, said Scott Lucas, professor of international studies at the University of Birmingham, England. But of course, the medical and public health professionals were not allowed to proceed unchecked, he said, referring to President Donald Trumps frequent undercutting of his own experts. When the virus first appeared in the United States, Trump and his supporters quickly dismissed it as either a hoax or a scourge that would quickly disappear once warmer weather arrived. At one point, Trump suggested that ultraviolet light or injecting disinfectants would eradicate the virus. He later said he was being facetious. Trumps frequent complaints about Dr. Anthony Fauci have regularly made headlines in Europe, where the US infectiousdisease expert is a respected figure. Italys leading COVID hospital offered Fauci a job if Trump fired him. Trump has defended the US response, saying the US numbers are so high because there is so much testing. Trump supporters and Americans who have refused to wear masks against all medical advice back that line. Theres no reason to fear any sickness thats out there, said Julia Ferjo, a mother of three in Alpine, Texas, who is vehemently against wearing a mask. Ferjo, , teaches fitness classes in a large gym with open doors. She doesnt allow participants to wear masks. When youre breathing that hard, I would pass out, she said. I do not want people just dropping like flies. And health officials watched with alarm as thousands of bikers gathered Friday in the small South Dakota city of Sturgis for an annual day motorcycle rally. The state has no mask mandates, and many bikers expressed defiance of measures meant to prevent the viruss spread. Dr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who is leading a team seeking treatments for COVID, decried such behavior, as well as the countrys handling of the virus. Theres no national strategy, no national leadership, and theres no urging for the public to act in unison and carry out the measures together, he said. Thats what it takes, and we have completely abandoned that as a nation. When he gets on Zoom calls with counterparts from around the globe, everyone cannot believe what theyre seeing in the US and they cannot believe the words coming out of the leadership, he said. Amid the scorn from other countries, Trump national security adviser Robert OBrien, newly recovered from the virus, gave an upbeat picture Sunday on CBS Face the Nation. Were going to fight like heck. Were working hard on vaccines. Were working hard on testing machines that are portable and fast. ... Were working on therapeutics, he said. Im so impressed with our scientists and our doctors and our first responders and the folks who are attacking this disease, and God bless them all. Many Europeans point proudly to their national health care systems that not only test but treat COVID for free, unlike the American system, where the virus crisis has only exacerbated income and racial inequalities in obtaining health care. The coronavirus has brutally stripped bare the vulnerability of a country that has been sliding for years, wrote Italian author Massimo Gaggi in his new book Crack America Broken America, about US problems that long predated COVID. Gaggi said he started writing the book last year and thought then that the title would be taken as a provocative wakeup call. Then the virus hit. By March the title wasnt a provocation any longer, he said. It was obvious. Agencies via Xinhua
