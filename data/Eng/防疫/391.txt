Reports suggest that no statement was forthcoming after the G foreign ministers video conference on Wednesday because US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted that it use the term Wuhan virus. While that serves to show the way in which the US administration has sought to exploit the pandemic as part of its campaign to isolate Chinaand divert attention from its own misjudged response to the pandemic because of that strategyit also shows that Washingtons blameChina cureall for the worlds problems is not easy to sell. The appreciation many countries have shown for Chinas assistance, among them some of the countries worsthit by the virus, is testimony to that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
