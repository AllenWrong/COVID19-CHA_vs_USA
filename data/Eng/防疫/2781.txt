People from all walks of life in Beijing have played their part in preventing and controlling the COVID pandemic, which helped the capital respond swiftly with proven measures. Hu Baogang is a community volunteer in Beijings Xicheng district. He has engaged in epidemic prevention and control since March. His daily tasks include measuring every entrants temperature, checking community residents passes and registering visitors basic information. The community, where Hu has lived for decades, has , households and more than , residents, of which more than  are migrant workers. Facing the challenge of epidemic prevention and control, Hu said that he feels a responsibility to protect the health and safety of his community. Gao Hongying, director of the communitys neighborhood committee, said Thanks to all these volunteers, community workers and officials from all levels of government, we have more time to focus on the management within the community as they take on the task of guarding the entrance. On June , a new COVID case was reported in Beijing after no new local cases were reported in the past  days. On June , Beijing raised its public health emergency response from the third to second level due to more than  cases being confirmed in just five days. It meant higher requirements for the citys epidemic prevention and control. Gao has been busy screening residents and their close contacts who have visited Xinfadi in the Fengtai district of Beijing and two other markets. The Xinfadi market is the place where almost all the cases were related for the new round of novel coronavirus infections. So far, more than  residents of the community have been quarantined at home. They have been tested for novel coronavirus and all have come back negative, Gao said. In the past two weeks, Gao and her colleagues visited every household in the community to learn about the recent whereabouts of residents, provided daily necessities and epidemic prevention supplies for those in quarantine and disinfected the area regularly. Gao and Hu are among nearly , community workers and volunteers who have fought the new outbreak in Beijing. They have stuck to their posts in Beijings , communities and villages. To reduce the risk of spreading the virus, people are cutting back on social activities, such as hanging out and partying. Under this context, deliverymen, as one of the important groups serving residents, have played a key role in maintaining the normal life and work of more than  million residents in Beijing. Song Xuewen, head of a JD Logistics station in Beijings Haidian district, said that it has  delivery workers and handles more than , packages a day. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic in January, he and his colleagues have gone to work at  am and finished after  pm, with little time for a good rest, according to Song. The company distributes masks twice a week and equips its logistics stations with other epidemic prevention and control supplies such as forehead thermometers, Song said. Song and his colleagues disinfect their office and accommodation on a daily basis and have measured one anothers temperature twice a day for months. The epidemic has not affected my income and life, but prompted us to work more carefully, Song said. To avoid customers flocking together to pick up parcels, we stagger deliveries, arrange the packages in order on shelves and mark information clearly. zhangdandanchinadaily.com.cn ?       ? ?                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
