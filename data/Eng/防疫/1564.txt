On the morning of Jan , Khalmehmet Kuxyan, a yearold Kazakh herdsman in Khujirt, a small village in Ili Kazakh autonomous prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, led nine companions on horseback to the government headquarters and asked to meet Li Dong, the local Party chief.Using broken Mandarin, it took Khalmehmet Kuxyan two minutes to make the chief understand that he and his fellow herdsmen were asking if they could help local cadres with prevention measures amid the rising number of novel coronavirus pneumonia cases in the area.I told Li to trust us because we are familiar with this area, and as the sons of nomads who have lived here for ages, it is time for us to unite and do something for our community, Khalmehmet Kuxyan said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
