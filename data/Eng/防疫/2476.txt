Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus outbreak, China Eastern Airlines has sent multiple charter flights not just to bring medical workers to Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, but to send consignments of medical supplies to other virusravaged places. The airline has also sent flights to bring Chinese nationals stranded overseas back home. China Eastern Airlines is the largest provider of charter flights during the outbreak.

It was on a mission from the Civil Aviation Administration to send the first batch of  medical workers to help the infected and stem the spread of the novel coronavirus in the city. It was the first civilian charter flight to Wuhan, a CEA executive said. The demand for charter flights offered by CEA reached a peak on Feb . Eighteen planes took off from six airports carrying , medical workers and nearly  metric tons of medical supplies from cities such as Shanghai Qingdao, Shandong province and Nanjing, Jiangsu province, to Wuhan. Longhaul airplanes like the Boeing B and Airbus Awhich have been used in many antivirus battles and evacuation missionswere chosen for the missions. Yet there was more to do than deploying flights. One staff member with CEA recalled Two charter flights landed at Shanghai one after another that day, which meant more attendants were needed. So we opened five checkin counters on Island B and four counters on Island C in Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport to offer fast checkin and baggage checkin services for the two medical teams. To ensure a safe flight operation, two experienced fivestar captains flew one airliner, according to CEA. As of Feb , a total of , medical workers from cities such as Taiyuan in Shanxi province, Xian in Shaanxi province and Suzhou in Jiangsu province flew to Hubei province on  CEA charter flights.

Since the early months in which the epidemic escalated and hospitals faced shortages of medical equipment, CEA has been working with Alibaba Group, Chinas ecommerce giant, to conduct an extensive global search for masks like the N to prevent the novel coronavirus. Eastern Air Logistics, a subsidiary of CEA, ran logistical services. A string of jobs were done in a timely manner, from the best flight selection, suitable model calculation, cabin reservation and material preparation to coordination among stations and customs clearance and cargo distribution, one company executive said. All the links were seamlessly connected to gain precious time for a fast delivery of medical equipment to Wuhan. By Feb , nearly , tons of medical equipment, including surgical masks, medical goggles and protective suits, were transported from inside the country and from foreign nations including France, the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Singapore and Japan, traveling either on cargo planes or in the belly of passenger flights, to the front lines. yinruoweichinadaily.com.cn ?
