Zhong Nanshan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a prominent expert on respiratory diseases, has said evidence shows the new virus can spread from human to human, and the epidemic may spread further, given that China will see a massive human migration during the upcoming Spring Festival holiday, which begins on Saturday. The source of the infection has not been located, and its means of transmission is not clear. Health experts agree the possibility exists for mutation of the virus, according to the National Health Commission. China is ramping up efforts in several areas. On Monday, President Xi Jinping ordered that resolute efforts be made to curb the spread of the virus, stressing putting peoples safety and health as the top priority. On Tuesday, the National Health Commission listed the pneumonia caused by the virus among Grade B infectious diseases, a category that includes such major infectious diseases as SARS, AIDS and polio. Currently, however, the new virus will be treated as a Grade A infectious disease, which requires the strictest prevention and control measures, including mandatory quarantine of patients and medical observation for those who have had close contact with patients, according to the commission. On Tuesday, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang called on locals not to leave the city and people from outside not to come to Wuhan if there is no particular need. Less human migration can reduce the spread of the virus, easing the pressure of prevention and control of the disease, he told China Central Television. Hubei Governor Wang Xiaodong asked on Tuesday for full efforts to monitor and report the outbreak. He asked for better public communication to respond to public concerns. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said in a statement that the Chinese government is sharing information regularly and working closely with the WHO, adding that a team of WHO experts is working with health officials in Wuhan in response to the virus.

Meanwhile, Matthew Cheung Kinchung, acting chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said on Tuesday that local authorities had adopted a multipronged strategy in response to the surging number of patients on the mainland, and because the Lunar New Year holiday rush is approaching. Beginning on Tuesday, all air passengers arriving from Wuhan are required to make health declarations when entering Hong Kong. The authorities also will require reports on patients with pneumonialike symptoms and a history of travel in the past two weeks to Hubei province. In Japan, at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and some ministers agreed that quarantine officials will thoroughly screen people coming from highrisk areas to prevent entry of the virus into Japan, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. Japans Health Ministry said on Monday that it had identified  people who may have had longterm contact with patients who had pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, the Japanese news agency Jiji Press reported. The ministry said last week that it had confirmed the first case in Japan of infection with the new coronavirus, adding that the patient is a Chinese man in Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, who tested positive for the virus after returning from Wuhan. South Korea is also ramping up screening efforts at its airports after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the virus on Monday in a Chinese woman who arrived in the country through Incheon International Airport.
