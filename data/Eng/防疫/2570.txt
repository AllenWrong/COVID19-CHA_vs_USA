Capital residents urged to be vigilant as heavy rain arrives
2020-08-11 00:00
Much of northern China, including Beijing, will have strong rainfall starting on Tuesday, according to the citys weather authority, which has reminded the public to be aware of potential risks. The citys flood control authorities also warned of mountain torrents that could pose challenges. Beijing had thunder showers with gusts and hail on Sunday night, triggering a yellow alertthe thirdhighest level in the fourtiered warning systemfrom the municipal meteorological station. With the roaring thunder, I was a little scared, said Chen Lei, a resident in Beijing. But he added it makes us feel safe to see no flooding around my community, and the water on the ground drained quickly, so traffic was not affected. With more rains coming, I hope the capital can do better, he added. In fact, the quick drainage of the torrential rains can be attributed to various measures that had been undertaken. For example, the Beijing Drainage Group responded quickly to the storm on Sunday night, sending about , workers to remove water to ensure clear roads and transportation. Torrential rains are forecast to start again on Tuesday by the local weather authority. As many areas in southern China have endured floods in the past month, cities and provinces in the north have been preparing for any risks. Asked what worries him most during the flood season, Huo Fenglin, an official in charge of flood control and drought relief at the Beijing Water Authority, said mountain torrents in Beijing is the most challenging problem. Its very difficult to forecast flooding in mountainous areas because it comes very quickly in a short period of time with a large amount of rainfall, and the geological conditions in the surrounding mountain areas in Beijing are not good for flood drainage, he said. To prevent any loss of property and human life caused by mountain floods, the municipal water authority has organized , people to improve monitoring at  ravines and gullies that might flood when it rains heavily in Beijing. The towns and villages where those ravines and gullies are located have held drills for the local residents to practice their escape routes. They should be familiar with where to go and how to get there as fast as possible, according to the standard of the authority. Meanwhile, the city has set up a cooperative mechanism for experts and local districts, especially suburban areas. The city has selected  experts from a hydrometric administration and two research institutions under the Beijing Water Authority to provide technology support for  districts in the city, which has ensured the capability of flood monitoring and prediction, emergency rescue work and related supplies in each district. Its the first such mechanism in China to match experts with every local district to ensure safety and a swift emergency response during the flood season, Huo said. The experts will be particularly familiar with the district he or she is responsible for and would provide accurate guidance when professional suggestions are needed. The COVID epidemic has created obstacles to the flood prevention work this year. Due to the prevention and control measures, some regular checks will take longer due to more procedures. The most important task is to ensure the safety of people and property in the capital during the flood season for the water authority, Huo said. Thus, no matter how complicated it can be, we will work closely with experts and the local administrations to prevent any damages it might bring. dujuanchinadaily.com.cn ?
