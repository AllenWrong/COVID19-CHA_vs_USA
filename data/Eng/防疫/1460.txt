In a letter to Chinese suppliers, Henrik Elm, Ikea supply manager, wrote China is a strategic sourcing market for Ikea and we strongly believe it will continue to be. In the spirit of true partnership, Ikea wants to support you to secure a smooth production restart, guaranteeing a safe environment for all workers. To that end, we will offer payment within  calendar days, with no interest deduction, for a period of three months, he said. Elm said he hopes this action will support affected businesses to come through this situation in the best possible financial health. Ikeas supply chain in China represents  percent of its global productivity in volume. It is critical for Ikea to ensure smooth production in China. From its entry into China  years ago, Ikea has grown into a company with product development, production and retail, owning  retail outlets, and more than  furniture and home furnishing suppliers and service providers on the Chinese mainland, creating nearly  million jobs.
