They built Huoshenshan Hospital within  days, dispatched more than  medical teams to Wuhan and threw in hundreds of billions yuan into epidemic control and prevention. Touching slogans are everywhere, he said. No one spares any effort in this fight. People in my country are not capable of doing this.Speaking of the severe situation in Italy, Kelu said he is worried about his family.Seeing that my motherland is clouded by the epidemic, Im worried. I already told my family to go out less and wear masks, he said.Italy has deployed preventive measures such as disinfecting, and I hope they will learn more from China. I believe that everything will pass.Another resident, Kim Youngah from South Korea, hailed Chinas cohesion in battling the coronavirus.The epidemic in South Korea is severe now, but preventive measures there are not carried out as effectively as in China, he said.My parents were worried about me before, but after seeing Chinas quick response and effective implementation of antiepidemic actions, they gradually felt at ease.Kim said his parents used to go out every day, but now they follow his advice, staying at home and wearing masks when they cant avoid going out.Many other foreigners in Quanzhou have also given thumbups to the Chinese peoples joint efforts to contain the coronavirus.
