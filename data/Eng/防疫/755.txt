Representatives from religious circles around the world called for greater religious exchanges and cooperation regarding global COVID pandemic prevention and control at a seminar on Monday.The seminar was held by the China Committee on Religion and Peace in Beijing, a nonprofit organization consisting of representatives from major religions in ChinaBuddhism, Taoism, Islam and Christianity.Participants from China, Australia, Japan, Belgium, Italy and other countries discussed how interfaith exchanges and cooperation could play a greater role in the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus outbreak.Deng Zongliang, executive vicepresident of the CCRP, said mankind is a community with a shared future as it faces the pandemic, and interfaith organizations are uniquely positioned to serve as advocates for communication, solidarity and cooperation.Interfaith movements should uphold the tradition of love and dedication, guide people to face the epidemic correctly, respect the value and dignity of life and maintain a positive and optimistic spirit and a responsible attitude, he said.Politicizing the pandemic and labeling the virus will not help prevent and control the outbreak or protect peoples lives, he added.He called on more cooperation among religious groups to strengthen understanding and trust among people of all countries.Yan Jue, vicepresident of the Buddhist Association of China, said that when the outbreak happened in China, the global Buddhist circles prayed for the Chinese people or donated money and materials. When the epidemic spread internationally, Chinas Buddhist community also offered to help.Only by abandoning prejudice and uniting and cooperating can countries in the world finally overcome the pandemic, he said.Luigi De Salvia, president of Religions for Peace Europe, said that religions can play important roles in building hope and promoting solidarity, especially in the context of suffering, confusion and even desperation.He said that in recent months, religious groups have played a role in alleviating the suffering caused by the epidemic through prayer, giving comfort and guiding believers to abide by the epidemic prevention and control rules.Nobuhiro Nemoto, secretarygeneral of the Asia Committee on Religion and Peace, said that religious people must work together with politicians, medical workers and research institutions to play a major role in overcoming physical and mental crises.?
