Secretary for the Civil Service Patrick Nip Takkuen, who headed the Universal Community Testing Programme, announced after its conclusion that more than . million people participated in the day operation and that the program had achieved the policy goal. He added that the total number of local residents who took nucleic acid tests for the COVID pathogen or antibody reached  million after adding those conducted at government and private hospitals and certified clinicslabs. However, Hong Kong has been reporting confirmed COVID cases of unknown source since the Universal Community Testing Programme ended, even with all the testing that was done and with contacttracing measures still in force. And there is no decision on when the SAR government will launch the phoneappbased Health Code program. In other words, Hong Kong has yet to establish an effective COVID prevention mechanism of its own, which is why it cannot further relax local socialdistancing rules or visitor entry restrictions at this moment. As a free port and open economy highly dependent on the service trade, Hong Kong wont be able to revive its economy as long as the antipandemic restrictions remain. It could be headed for a deeper recession, or even an economic depression. The third wave of COVID infections hit Hong Kong in July and forced the SAR government to tighten visitor screening, testing and mandatory quarantine, but the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the JuneAugust period held steady from the previous statistical period of May through July. Some observers thus suggest the governments emergency efforts to preserve jobs under the pandemic have worked somehow, and the impact from the resurging pandemic on the economy is still manageable. With a closer analysis of the situation, however, one should find behind the JuneAugust unemployment rate of . percent, unchanged from the MayJuly period, , more people found jobs, about , more lost their jobs and around , were underemployed in JuneAugust, compared with the MayJuly period. The underemployment rate rose to . percent in JuneAugust period, a new high since the SARS epidemic in . Even more alarming is that, in addition to worsening unemployment in consumer services and tourismrelated industries, the unemployment rate in the  age group also rose from . percent in the MayJuly period to . percent in June through August. The yearolds fared the worst jobwise, with . percent unemployed in the JuneAugust period, up from . percent in May through July. The black revolution has no doubt brought Hong Kongs youthrelated problems to the forefront of sociopolitical challenges, which have not subsided since the National Security Law drove the black revolution underground. Although economic recovery alone cannot fix all of Hong Kongs youthrelated issues, there is no doubt that things will get worse if the economic slump continues. Hong Kong has long believed in a freemarket mechanism, which allows far more small and mediumsize enterprises to flourish alongside the big ones while the government typically keeps tabs on the economy through fiscal policy adjustments. Hong Kong may have a whopping financial reserve of over HK trillion  billion, but nearly HK billion of it has been drawn from the Antiepidemic Fund to battle the first two waves of COVID, as well as for financial aid for local residents in the  fiscal year. That is why the SAR government has earmarked only HK billion for the Antiepidemic Fund in the wake of the much worse third wave of infections, much less than in the first two waves. Of the HK billion, HK billion will be spent on preventing future resurgences of COVID, while just HK. billion will go to economic recovery efforts, mostly as consolation packages for the worsthit sectors. For the same reason, financial assistance for underprivileged groups will be just HK. billion. And Finance Secretary Paul Chan Mopo has ruled out further plans to help employers keep workers. The government made it clear, even though the financial reserve has been reduced from over HK trillion to about HK billion but remains healthy, it is definitely not up to further bleeding of the reserves at previous scales. From now on, Hong Kong must do its best in containing the spread of COVID no matter how many more waves will come in the future so as to allow socioeconomic activities to return to basically normal, which requires an effective pandemic prevention mechanism in place as soon as possible. The reality facing Hong Kong, call it gloom and doom if you will, is quite straightforward The government and local society as a whole must do everything they can to stop the spread of COVID in order to resume normal socioeconomic activities as soon as possible. Otherwise, Hong Kong may soon find itself struggling in a recession worse than any crisis in recent history. That will give rise to serious social unrest and political strife for sure. But the government cannot keep drawing from public coffers as it did to battle the first two waves of the pandemic, leaving Hong Kong society no choice but to commit to all effective measures necessary to arrest the pandemic. The SAR government and the public to some extent must maintain an open mind to any successful story out there, such as Singapores experience in contact tracing and quarantine. This is not the time for selfindulgence in anything but particularly individual freedom by risking public health amid a deadly pandemic, not that it ever is, in a matter of speaking. The top priority for Hong Kong right now is definitely getting COVID under control as soon as possible because everything else depends on it going forward.
