A research report, America Ranked First?! The Truth about Americas Fight against COVID, was jointly released by three Chinese think tanks in Beijing on Monday. William Jones, Washington Bureau Chief for the Executive Intelligence Review, attributed the failure to contain the virus spread in the US to the continuous politicization of the pandemic since President Joe Biden took office in January, despite making epidemic prevention and control a priority. In contrast to Chinas distribution of millions of vaccine doses worldwide, the Biden administration boasted that the US, not China, would become the main distributor of vaccines globally, working overtime in order to catch up, which they still have not done, Jones noted.
