In honor of the freights special destination, the train was dubbed Jinbo, which is short for the CIIE in Chinese. The variety of exhibits being transported was impressive, and included machines with an intelligent jetwashing system and electrical machinery parts. The containers were properly disinfected to meet the expos epidemic prevention requirements. According to Wang Jinqiu, chairman of the trains operating company in Shanghai, making use of the train rather than the traditional sea route cut the transportation time by half. With over  routes, the freighttrain service has provided transport support for the economic and social development in countries and regions along the Belt and Road. The new route linking Hamburg and Shanghai provides a fasttrack option to enterprises from those countries participating in the CIIE, highlighting the growing influence of the event and cementing connectivity along the Belt and Road.
