It can cause paralysis and, on rare occasions, can be fatal.Polio is spread when the stool of an infected person is introduced into the mouth of another person through contaminated water or food.There is no cure for polio. However, it can only be prevented with multiple doses of polio vaccines that have long been proven safe and effective.
