The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said China currently has  enterprises making disinfectant and sterilization products. Cao Xuejun, deputy director of the consumer products industry department of the MIIT, said the overall domestic production capacity of disinfectant is enough to meet demand, but more efforts are needed to produce smaller bottles of disinfectant which have seen bigger demand recently. Also, the supply of package material for disinfectant and sterilization products is not enough, Cao said, adding the ministry will take new measures to help solve these problems.
