Solid industrial foundation, policy support help maintain foreign trade development                    Chinas key role in global supply and industrial chains will not be altered due to the temporary disruptions from the novel coronavirus epidemic, said officials and global business leaders. At present, there is no largescale transfer of supply and industrial chains to foreign countries due to the outbreak, said Zong Changqing, director of the department of foreign investment administration of the Ministry of Commerce. Fundamentals of Chinas longterm economic development and its competitive advantage in attracting foreign capital have not changed, said Zong, adding that most multinational enterprises are confident about prospects in the country and have not altered their investment strategy. The government has implemented a number of measures to help domestic and global companies to resolve issues such as work resumption, logistics and gathering sufficient production material, as well as items for epidemic prevention and control, to restore their earnings strength. Volkmar Denner, the CEO of Bosch Group, said most of the companys China plants are ramping up operations again, while also taking precautionary measures to ensure employees safety. He said Bosch believes the impact on the Chinese economy will be temporary. Once China recovers, we have full confidence that it will continue to develop sustainably, he said. Supported by more than , employees in China, the German industrial conglomerate will put its first innovation and software center outside Germany into operation in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, in midyear. Li Xingqian, director of the department of foreign trade of the Ministry of Commerce, noted that China is an important link in the global supply chain for many multinational companies. The impact of the epidemic on the supply chain in the area of foreign trade mainly occurred in material supply and product assembly. Exportoriented companies have encountered temporary difficulties, he said. However, the viruss influence is regional, limited and fully controllable. The work resumption rate of Chinas machinery manufacturers reached . percent by Thursday, data from the Beijingbased China Machinery Industry Federation showed. The countrys foreign trade development has been backed by resilience and ample space for innovation, Li said, and with successive policies related to foreign trade stabilization, more favorable conditions will be created to enrich the nations industrial chain in supporting foreign trade. Honson To, chairman for China and the AsiaPacific at KPMG, said that after more than four decades of rapid growth, China has a solid industrial foundation, a complete industrial chain and a highquality labor force, which cannot be replaced by any other economy in the world. Stan Zurkiewicz, executive vicepresident of Stuttgartbased DEKRA Group, one of the worlds largest testing, certification and inspection companies with more than , employees worldwide, said China responded to various crises in the past by accelerating market reforms and further opening up to the outside world. We believe that after the immediate priority of containing the epidemic has been accomplished, China will embark on another wave of market reforms, further improving the investment environment in the country, he said. The testing, certification and inspection industry is the fundamental backbone which allows trade and commerce to occur both domestically and internationally, said Zurkiewicz. We believe in the enormous longterm potential of the Chinese economy, and DEKRA will continue to invest in the country.

In January, , new foreignfunded enterprises were established across China, while FDI increased . percent in South Korea, . percent in Japan and . percent in Singapore, data showed. Wei Jianguo, former viceminister of commerce, said that since the outbreak is affecting other countries such as South Korea and Japan, further disruptions to the global supply chain are likely. To better control the situation, it is imperative to strengthen international cooperation, Wei said, adding that China, Japan and South Korea could build a mechanism for industrial coordination. China should also cooperate with more economies including the European Union, Australia and African nations to ensure the operation of global supply and industrial chains, Wei said.

Zhang Yansheng, a senior researcher with the Beijingbased China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said the novel coronavirus outbreak may be shortlived, but countries collaboration in the supply chain will be longterm. Thanks to cuttingedge technologies such as artificial intelligence and G, cooperation in the supply chain will evolve and become more flexible, Zhang said. Dimitri de Vreeze, coCEO of Netherlandsbased Royal DSM, said Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by the coronavirus. The Chinese government has been taking the right measures with huge intensity and huge efforts. People always ask, Will China recover? I think that is the wrong question, said de Vreeze. The question should be, When will it recover? Because China and the Chinese people have shown in the past resilience, perseverance and strength. Thats also what we see today and we will see for the future.
