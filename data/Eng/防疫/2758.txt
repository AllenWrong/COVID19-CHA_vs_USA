PhotoSipa    Administrative approval and other arbitrary ways local governments restrict companies from resuming production with the excuse of coronavirus control should be strictly prohibited, said an official on Tuesday. Ou Xiaoli, director general of the social development department at the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a news conference that although it is understandable that local governments are eager to take measures to prevent the coronavirus epidemic from spreading further in regions under their legislation, they shouldnt choose those simple and arbitrary ways, such as lifting bars of approval for companies. Government officials should spend more time and energy finding out the real problems that companies are facing and think of ways to help solve those problems while taking measures to prevent the epidemic from spreading, Ou said. We have observed some of the misconduct from local governments and have urged them to make corrections. Going forward we will make further efforts to help companies to resume production by creating favorable conditions while strengthening the epidemic prevention, Ou said.
