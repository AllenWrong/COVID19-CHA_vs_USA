China has shared virus information with world in timely manner since the beginning                    Editors note With the number of hospitalized COVID patients having dropped to zero in Wuhan, the Chinese city once hit hardest by the novel coronavirus pandemic, China Daily will publish a series of stories sharing frontline experts views on key issues, such as whether China attempted to conceal epidemic information from the world, when the turning point of the epidemic occurred, and how China has managed to keep a low death toll. This is the first of three stories.When asked whether China has concealed epidemic information from the world, Jiao Yahui, an official responsible for medical administration and supervision with the National Health Commission, the nations top health authority, gave a definite no without any hesitation.If China had ever wanted to hide its COVID death toll, it wouldnt have published the revised death figure in Wuhan, which jumped about  percent compared with the previous figure, she said.China has never, ever, intentionally concealed epidemic information from the world. Both the revised death toll and the number of confirmed cases in the city have increased, which shows that we want to share the fact with the world and be transparent.On April , the Wuhan government revised the death toll in the city from , to , after local authorities had the opportunity to correct some inaccuracies in reporting that occurred in the early stages of the outbreak. By the end of Monday, the COVID death toll on the Chinese mainland stood at ,, of which about  percent were in Wuhan, according to the National Health Commission.Actually, during the revision of the death toll, weve seen certain casualties that have been reported multiple times via our epidemic reporting system by more than one medical institute, because they have all treated the patients, so we have to write off the duplication, Jiao said.The revision also shows that the data in the system is reliable and transparent, and medical institutes can directly report confirmed cases and the death toll independently, Jiao said in an exclusive interview with China Daily on Friday.There are two reporting systems for doctors to report the epidemic in China One allows doctors to report more than  identified infectious diseases, and the other, which was established to cope with the SARS outbreak in China in , allows them to report pneumonia of unknown causes. The alarm for COVID was sounded via the latter, Jiao said.Zhang Dingyu, president of Jinyintan Hospital, which specializes in infectious diseases and was the first hospital designated for COVID cases in Wuhan, witnessed how the alarm was sounded.On Dec , a doctor at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine reported three pneumonia cases of unknown origin to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention at Jianghan district in Wuhan. This was the first time Chinese authorities obtained information about the disease.At  pm on Dec , six patients with pneumonia of unknown origin were transferred to Jinyintan Hospital. After consultation with epidemiologists, we filed their cases on the system for reporting pneumonia of unknown origin straightaway. We just followed the protocol, Zhang said in an exclusive interview on Thursday.On Dec , the Wuhan Health Commission issued an urgent notice asking all medical institutions to report patients with pneumonia of unknown origin. On Dec , the commission released a briefing on its website about pneumonia with unknown origin, confirming  cases and telling the public not to go to enclosed public spaces or hold gatherings. On the same day, experts from the National Health Commission arrived in Wuhan to look into the cases.After the new virus was identified and listed as an infectious disease, we then started to use the routine system to report COVID infections, Zhang said, adding that the system also added the option of asymptomatic infection later to ensure all the cases could be filed accurately.In China, its the medics responsibility to report infectious diseases to the local centers for disease control and prevention. The information will be verified and then sent to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, he said.Jiao said the reporting of infectious diseases doesnt need to go through any government bodies. The data is directly collected by CDCs at different levels under a system that was designed to avoid interference from outsiders.In China, CDCs are independent research organizations instead of political bodies. I believe they have no motive to temper the data. As researchers, their first instinct is to find the cause of the infection but not to conceal information, she said.Jiao said China has been sharing epidemic control information with the world in a timely and transparent manner since the very beginning.On Dec , the World Health Organizations China Office was informed of pneumonia cases of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, according to the WHO.Starting on Jan , China has regularly informed the WHO, relevant countries and regions and Chinas Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan about the pneumonia outbreak.On Jan , an expert evaluation team from the National Health Commission initially identified a new coronavirus as the cause of the epidemic.On Jan , China submitted to the WHO the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus, which was published by the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and shared globally.China has been sitting a closedbook exam on containing the outbreak, while it is an openbook exam for the rest of the world due to the information and experiences shared by China, Jiao said. Many countries could have developed diagnosis kits then to find infected people, but they missed the window period.As the COVID death toll has surged around the world, people have questioned whether there are still unreported cases in China. Jiao said the number of patients at fever clinics in Wuhan can clear the doubts.When the epidemic situation was grim in Wuhan, the fever clinics in the citythe outposts of epidemic controlsaw more than , people a day. Now the number has dropped to between  and , even lower than the normal average level, she said.If there are still unreported cases, people will of course seek treatment at fever clinics. You cannot stop them, she said.cuijiachinadaily.com.cn?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
