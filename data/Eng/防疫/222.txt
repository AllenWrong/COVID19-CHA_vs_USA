XINHUA TIANJINAt  pm one chilly evening, yearold Zheng Xukun, protected headtotoe by a hazmat suit together with an N mask, a pair of medical goggles, latex gloves and waterproof protective boots, was still busy detecting nucleic acid of the novel coronavirus. Zheng is one of the virus detectives working at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Enshi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture in Central Chinas Hubei province, the hardesthit by the coronavirus epidemic. Zheng has been working as a CDC laboratory technician for three years in North Chinas Tianjin city, responsible for detecting more than , samples of flulike throat swabs and  samples of measles and rubella every year. I am working with the virus every day, she says, smiling. On Feb , she volunteered to go to Enshi, about , kilometers from her hometown, to aid local colleagues in nucleic acid detection in the hardhit region. Zheng still remembers the day when she arrived in the virushit city with another three technicians. It was a rainy, cold morning. Local staff prepared cottonpadded shoes for us. They are not the most fashionable, but they are warm. Nucleic acid detection has been the most important method to screen the latent virus in the body of a patient since the outbreak, but it was not as easy as people thought. The workload of sample testing was beyond Zhengs imagination.
