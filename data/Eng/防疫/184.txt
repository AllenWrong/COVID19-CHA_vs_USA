Many people are choosing to spend Spring Festival in cities where they work instead of returning to their hometowns to reduce the risk of COVID transmission. But some still want to return home for the festival. Lets hear about their plans for this unusual Chinese New Year celebration.  Ren Jiaqi, , veterinarian Current location Beijing Hometown Taiyuan, North Chinas Shanxi province Its the sixth consecutive year that I dont return home for the Spring Festival. It is partly because my mother also works away from home, and partly because the hospital needs me to be on duty. Every year, my mother and I go back to our hometown together at another time. This year, maybe in April, well return to visit my grandparents on my mothers side. Ive already received my favorite goodie  a large bottle of cooked mutton sent from my beloved grandparents. And Im not alone with the company of the adorable pets in my hospital. They are a big comfort. On Spring Festivals eve, I plan to get off work earlier and eat hotpot or instant noodles with my colleagues.
