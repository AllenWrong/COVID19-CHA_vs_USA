League confident of resumption thanks to help from nations virus expert Zhong                                             Regarded as a hero in the battle against the COVID outbreak, Chinas top respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan is now coming to the rescue of the Chinese Basketball Association. After seeing earlier plans to resume league action pushed back over health fears, CBA boss Yao Ming is confident his latest restart plans can earn approval from the central government thanks to the input of Zhong and his team. The plan we are preparing is to keep the season as complete as possible and to play the remainder of the season at tournaments instead of the homeandaway format, Yao told China Central Television in an interview aired on Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
