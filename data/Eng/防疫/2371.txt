Immigration authorities were asked to set up special areas for checks on personnel relevant to the Winter Olympics at entry and exit points and implement strict antiepidemic measures. Stressing continuing strict entry and exit policies, the NIA encouraged people to avoid unnecessary and nonurgent travel abroad. It also vowed cooperation with law enforcement authorities of neighboring countries in border patrols to crack down on criminal activities and prevent the spread of the virus.
