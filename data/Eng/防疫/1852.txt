The Ministry of Finance and the Civil Aviation Administration of China issued a joint statement on Monday stating that the central government will provide financial support to both Chinese and foreign air transportation enterprises to cushion them from the COVID impact and maintain smooth operation of global industrial chains and supply chains through stable international cargo deliveries. Carriers can receive  percent of the costs involved in converting passenger aircraft into cargo, according to the announcement. Carriers will receive rewards for flying international cargo flights during the COVID epidemic prevention and containment period. The international air cargo market is dominated by leading logistics giants like FedEx, DHL and UPS, while Chinese cargo airlines with an ambition to develop overseas markets are facing challenges in making heavy investments and dealing with the various risks in the global market, said Chen Zhuo, a senior analyst with China Merchants Securities. The government support measures and subsidies will help ease the current pressure on carriers amid the ongoing epidemic and help them to develop their international cargo business, said Chen.

International carriers including United Airlines are also accelerating the ongoing cargoonly flights between the US and Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Hong Kong, so as to ensure vital goods, especially medical relief supplies, reach people who need them.

On Tuesday,  international cargo flights landed at airports on the Chinese mainland and there were another  passenger aircraft turned cargo planes arrived. The COVID outbreak has highlighted the importance of cargo airlines and something that Chinese civil aviation enterprises still need to scale up. Although the cost compensation can hardly make up for the loss in passenger flights, the measures are sending signals that the government supports airlines international cargo operation, said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at carnoc.com, one of Chinas biggest civil aviation websites.
