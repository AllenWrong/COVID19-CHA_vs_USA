There was a bright spot in the data, though. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said stayathome orders and social distancing may be paying off, as the rate of increase in new infections appears to be declining. The daily increases are not in that steep incline, Fauci said. However, evidence of flattening the curve is preliminary. The captain of the US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt has called on Navy leadership for stronger measures to save the lives of his sailors and stop the spread of the coronavirus aboard the ship.

A researcher at MIT says current social distancing guidelines may not be stringent enough to limit spread of the virus. Associate Professor Lydia Bourouiba has studied the dynamics of coughs and sneezes at MITs Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Lab and found that exhalations can create clouds that travel as much as  feet. Theres an urgency in revising the guidelines currently being given by WHO and the CDC on the needs for protective equipment, particularly for the frontline health care workers, she told USA Today. Also, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC told NPR on Monday that the agencys policy on masks is being aggressively reviewed as we speak. Dr Robert Redfield said that now you have individuals that may not have any symptoms that can contribute to transmission, and we have learned that in fact they do contribute to transmission. The CDC and the World Health Organization WHO have previously advised against the wearing of masks by uninfected persons.
