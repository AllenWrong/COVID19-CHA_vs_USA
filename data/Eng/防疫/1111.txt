The CFA top official told the AFP that they had concern when giving a passport to Elkeson, whose Chinese name is Ai Kesen, but added that Chinese fans love to have a few naturalized players in the squad as long as they can make the Chinese team better and take us to the World Cup, hopefully Qatar . Its not a longterm strategy or approach. Were not going to have twothirds of the squad from Brazil. We might have two or three, three or four probably, but thats it, Liu noted. In the Chinese teams last training camp in May, head coach Li Tie called up two Brazilianborn players, Ai Kesen and Luo Guofu. Liu said that the first round of the Chinese Super League CSL matches went better than expected and that a small resurgence of the COVID virus in Dalian has had no real impact on the league. We have another  rounds of the competition, so this is just the start of the entire process, he cautioned. At the moment I can say that we are very safe. Were playing the competition in a very safe and comfortable environment, Liu said. The CSL  season, which had been scheduled to kick off on February , was postponed due to the COVID outbreak and began on July . The  teams have been split into two groups in two locations, one in Dalian and the other in Suzhou, with strict epidemic prevention measures in place.
