Medical institutions face higher risks of novel coronavirus infection and they are prone to cluster epidemics, the circular published by the National Health Commission on Friday read. Medical institutions still face severe challenges in epidemic control, as exposed by the cluster of COVID epidemics that occurred in some individual medical institutions in Shandong and Heilongjiang provinces recently, it said. Medical institutions must strictly carry out epidemic control measures, especially in their fever clinics, and all medical staff in fever clinics should intensify selfprotection and conduct sampling, transport, preservation and testing of novel coronavirus following standards, it said. They must report and isolate suspected or confirmed cases swiftly so they can be transferred to designated hospitals for further diagnosis and treatment, according to the circular. Medical institutions should also intensify management over wards and forbid visits to patients by their family members or friends unless necessary. Local authorities across the country should intensify lab building at hospitals and clinics, so all tertiary hospitals and major hospitals in counties will be capable of coronavirus testing as soon as possible, and all secondary hospitals will be capable of virus testing gradually, the circular said. Medical institutions should provide virus testing to all people in need, including suspected patients, patients to be hospitalized and medical workers, to identify risks of infection in a timely fashion.
