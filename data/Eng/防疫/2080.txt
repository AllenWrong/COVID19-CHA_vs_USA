PhotoAgencies    Across the US, data suggests that people living in areas with high poverty rates  who are often members of minority groups  are hit harder by the novel coronavirus. The Detroit Free Press reported that African Americans, who make up  percent of Michigans population, account for  percent of the states COVID deaths. In New York, African Americans make up  percent of coronavirus hospitalizations but  percent of the states population, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Houston, Texas, an analysis of data released by Harris County in late April revealed a similar pattern. The data indicates that ZIP codes representing several of Houstons primarily African American neighborhoods have double or triple the citywide average per capita infection rate of  case per , residents. The University of California, San Francisco UCSF recently released a study conducted with government agencies and the local Latino Task Force showing unusually higher infection results for Latinos. In the study, a team of community workers and volunteers conducted random tests in San Franciscos Mission District in late April. Of nearly , residents examined, . percent tested positive. And about half of those showed no symptoms. The results showed that Latinos accounted for  percent of the positive cases, although they made up only  percent of those tested. White people accounted for  percent of those tested. Their infection rate was less than  percent. The study also showed that among those who tested positive,  percent reported being unable to work from home. In contrast, among those who tested negative,  percent reported no impact on their work or financial stability. This project represents an exponential leap into the next stage of the fight against COVID, which is to move from diagnostic testing of people who are ill to broad communitybased screening, said Dr Diane Havlir, chief of UCSFs Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine and the principal investigator of the study. This is critical to our ability to identify where the virus is still actively spreading and to enable us to act swiftly to get control of this epidemic, she said. We hope this can be a model for future communityscreening efforts in San Francisco and beyond. As of Wednesday, the US has seen nearly . million confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus resulting in more than , deaths, according Johns Hopkins University. Tara Hayes, director of human welfare policy at the American Action Forum AAF, published research Tuesday on COVIDs impact on minority communities that shows that minorities will disproportionately feel the health and economic impact of the pandemic. The study analyzed available data and found that black Americans, while accounting for  percent of the population in the US, account for  percent of confirmed cases,  percent of hospitalizations and  percent of deaths where racial and ethnic data are being reported. The study said that poor or inconsistent data for other racial and ethnic groups makes it difficult to assess the impact on other minority populations. But the study suggests that based on what is known, it would not be surprising if other minority groups similarly experience disproportionate negative outcomes from the virus. Hayes research delved into why minorities are more affected by COVID They are less likely to have health insurance and more likely to have underlying health conditions, putting them at greater risk for negative outcomes if they contract the virus. They are more likely to be employed in lowwage jobs at risk of loss as a result of the economic downturn, while lowwage workers in essential jobs are more likely to work in environments that require close contact with others, increasing their risk of exposure to the virus. They are more likely to live in dense urban areas and to have more people living within a household, making it more challenging to isolate sick and atrisk family members. The pandemic is not creating these disparities, but rather highlighting and worsening existing disparities, Hayes concluded.
