The virtual event was jointly sponsored by a group of nongovernmental organizations, including the Civil Society Organizations Congress of the Peoples of Colombia, International Solidarity Committee of Venezuela, European Collective of Ecuadorian Diversity, Chinese Society for Human Rights Studies, and Latin American Foundation for Human Rights and Social Development. Prof. Zhang Wanhong, executive director of the Institute for Human Rights Studies at Chinas Wuhan University, said at the webinar that the tragic event unfolded on May  in Minneapolis that resulted in the death of George Floyd illustrates the deeprooted racism and social discrimination against people of African descent in the country. After reviewing the situation of Asian Americans through a historical timeline, Zhang turned to contemporary issues by focusing on COVID related practice, and said that antiAsian American harassment has been further stoked by US governments repeated use of stigmatizing and offensive words. Racism and xenophobia in the United States during the pandemic, he noted, undermine the solidarity in global cooperation against the virus, deteriorate the lives and livelihoods of certain ethnics, and further strengthen the existence of racism and xenophobia. Dr. Zhou Li of Chinas Southwest University of Political Science and Law, told the webinar that the COVID outbreak and the waves of protests after Floyds death are interconnected, since the epidemic has led to increasing risks for certain groups. African Americans, who make up about  percent of the US population, account for . percent of related deaths of COVID cases, said Zhou, citing the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the institutional and psychosocial structure of the United States, there is not only white supremacism, but also the foundation of the interests of capital priority, he said. AlfredMaurice de Zayas, former UN independent expert, said in a written speech to the webinar that Floyds death was not a unique occurrence, but one among thousands of African Americans who have been victims of the excessive use of force by the US police. The United States now needs longterm solutions instead of band aids, de Zayas said, adding that it is crucial to address the root causes of violence, including social injustice, income inequality, lack of proper education training, and employment possibilities. Lucrecia Hernandez, lecturer attorney and director of the social organization SURES, told the webinar that racism as a state policy and a structural policy has long been rooted since the founding of the United States, and the idea of white supremacy has fueled two centuries of racial violence. Floyds death is just the most recent example, in a long history of killings of AfricanAmerican people by police in the United States with little or no accountability, the expert said. Gideon Award recipient Mark Burton told the webinar that there is a massive amount of police violence in the United States, and black people are two and a half times more likely to be killed by the police. For the American attorney, Floyds death is just the last straw that breaks the camels back, since people have seen over the recent years so many similar videos of young AfricanAmerican people being killed by the police. Burton said it is a shame that the United States withdrew from the UN Human Rights Council. The United States took a very hostile attitude towards the protests and even threatened demonstrators with violence, he said, which he believes is also regrettable.
