Huaweis communications solutions continue to add more value to society

Communications enterprise Huawei has appealed to all stakeholders for more focus on Gs real application in society, so as to expand the technologys value. The expectation of G has never been limited to the consumer sector. We are expecting it to change the society and create new values for the society. Such changes are taking place in all walks of life, said Hu Houkun, vicechairman of Huawei. Hu noted there is no outofthebox approach to innovation. Weve got to focus on the real needs in real scenarios and build up the capabilities to meet those needs. Hu made the comments at the annual Mobile Broadband Forum, which was concluded in Shanghai on Friday. This is the second time for the forum to be held in Shanghai. The last time was in , when China had just started the construction of its G network. This year, the G network has been widely deployed in China, and its business has begun to be put into full use. The construction of the G network is accelerating around the world. There are already  networks for its commercial use and more than  kinds of G terminals. In the process of G development, the landscape in China is pleasant, Hu said. More than , base stations have been deployed in China, covering more than  cities and supporting more than  million G connections across the country. China has the best G network in the world. As a consumer, the most intuitive feeling is its fast speed, Hu said. However, the fast speed is not the only one thing that G can bring us. Actually, the G is changing society in all aspects. During the COVID epidemic, it took Wuhan only  days to establish the Leishenshan Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital. At the same time, Huawei worked together with operators and spent only  hours establishing a G network covering the hospitals every corner. With G connectivity, the practice of remote healthcare consultation, remote Bultrasound and multifunctional medical robots became a reality, that provided crucial support amid the epidemic outbreak. Hu shared a case to embody Gs usage in healthcare practiceto help medical staff wear protective suits. As the procedure of putting on protective suits was very strict, most doctors and nurses could spend half an hour or even an hour doing so. In order to prevent cross infection, they should put on the suits in an isolated area where only one person could stay at a time. In this situation, G came in handy. Huawei helped the hospitals to deploy G CPE Pro Router and highdefinition cameras in the workspace. Through remote video, they guided medical staff to wear the suits correctly and check whether standards were met, which not only helped the medical staff to improve their work efficiency, but also provided them with better protection, Hu said. Another case Hu provided took place at Ningbos smart port, where the gantry cranes are the most commonly used equipment. Huaweis G solution brought the working model tremendous changes. In the past, gantry crane drivers had to climb to the control room located  meters high and work for eight hours without rest. During their work time, they needed to bow their heads for a long time, keep staring at the containers under their feet and operate with both hands. After one work shift, a number of them would experience a pain in the waist, neck and back and dizziness. Nowadays, with G enabled there is remote control of the gantry cranes at the port. Today, the driver can sit in an airconditioned office and move the containers remotely. The highdefinition cameras will show the exact position of the containers on the screens. The operator scan control the cranes and put containers down stably onto trucks. Remote control of gantry cranes has improved the loading and unloading efficiency by  percent, and reduced the comprehensive labor cost by more than  percent after scale use, Hu said. More importantly, it significantly improved the unmanned operation level of the port and achieved higher security. Moreover, the working conditions of the operators have been greatly improved. The occurrence of occupational diseases has been reduced, and it became easier to recruit people. Not only at the port, the adoption of G in industry can be seen from steel to power grid, from mining to manufacturing, Hu said. As of September, Chinas three major operators had implemented over , innovative G projects and signed over , G business contracts. China has a perfect industrial structure and massive industrial scale. Compared with that achievement, what we have achieved in the G industry today is only the first step. However, when it comes to meet the vastly different requirements in every industry, there is no such thing as a onesizefitsall solution, Hu said. There is a strong willingness in the industries to embrace G. However, we need to go deeper into different scenariobased needs, make up the standards, screen the requirements and find the real needs that deserve our investment, Hu added. Huawei proposed four criteria to explore the scenariobased needs technical relevance, business potential, maturity of industrial chain and standardization. Technical relevance refers to whether G is the best choice compared with other telecommunications technologies in specific application scenarios. For example, in the remote control scenario of port gantry cranes, optical fiber cannot meet the requirements of moving gantry cranes. WiFi can meet the requirement of mobility to a certain degree, but it cannot meet the requirements of highdefinition video. While G can solve all these problems. Business potential can be understood as follows whether the demand brought about by specific scenarios can be replicated in other different industries on a large scale, and whether a business model beneficial to all parties can be formed. In industries with mature integration capabilities, G, playing as a key connectivity, can be easily and quickly embedded. It is more conducive to its rapid promotion. The degree of standardization is also very important. For industries and scenarios with a high degree of standardization, G technology is easier to get high efficiency. Based on these screening dimensions, we identified some typical scenes, such as remote control, video transmission and machine vision detection. These scenarios in industry have common demands of G and are worthy of more investment, Hu said. Moreover, the prices of G modules are going down, Hu said. Since the first G module was released two years ago, more than  suppliers have provided more than  kinds of G modules and more than  kinds of industrial terminals, including G cameras,  Gunmanned aerial vehicles and G robots. Reduction in cost is also the key to enriching G terminal ecology, Hu said. He expected the G module price will continue to drop in the future. By the end of , the price of G module will be reduced to about , and further reduced to about  by the end of , Hu said. G will create increasingly greater value for industries over the next decade. This means a golden period of rapid development for the telecoms industry. Moving forward, we will have to overcome various difficulties, and moving every step forward requires change. But I firmly believe that the hardest things are the things worth doing most. Because when you succeed, the results will be incredibly valuable. Huawei is ready and willing to join in hands with its operators, enterprise customers and industry partners to push the boundaries of innovation and realize a winwin result. ?
