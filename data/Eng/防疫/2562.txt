Intellectual property authorities around China have ramped up support for enterprises IPcollateralized financing to ease their pressures amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.Earlier this month, the National Intellectual Property Administration issued several policies to help businesses resume production.According to the policies, provincial and municipal IP authorities are called upon to encourage epidemicaffected businesses to collateralize their IP and secure loans from financial institutions. The policies detail that green channels should be established for the rapid approval of IP collateral registration.In response, the Guangdong Administration for Market Regulation, also known as the Guangdong Intellectual Property Administration, in South China has made provincial investigations into emergency supplies and enterprises production status. It has given strong support to cashstrapped companies.Among the beneficiary enterprises is Chunxia New Materials Tech, a manufacturer of nonwoven products in Dongguan, Guangdong province. Chunxia has filed  patent applications and  of them have been granted.Due to the huge demand for face masks amid the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak, the companys orders have surged, leading to a shortage of liquid capital.Having learned about the problem, the Dongguan intellectual property administration instructed Chunxia to register for collateral online and contacted superior offices to open up the green channel.As a result, Chunxia got the patentcollateralized registration certificate one working day after its application was received. With three patents used as collateral, Chunxia secured a loan of  million yuan . million from the Dongguan branch of China Construction Bank.The citys IP administration has also offered interest subsidies. Chunxia only needs to pay half of the appraisal fees and premiums charged during the patentcollateralized application process.Chen Xiwen, head of the Dongguan IP administration, said the city is committed to helping businesses raise capital and expand production in the fight against the epidemic.An IPcollateralized financing platform has been built between banks and enterprises, Chen said. The platform can effectively alleviate financial strain faced by medical products makers because of the lack of a realestate mortgage.As for companies which received IPcollateralized loans before, the IP administration has checked over their financial condition to avoid risks such as the withdrawal or delay of lending due to the outbreak.Other measures released by NIPA include giving priority to patent applications and trademark registrations related to the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus.zhanglinwanchinadaily.com.cn?                                                                    !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
