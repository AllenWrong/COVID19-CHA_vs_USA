Boycott of Olympics against human rights
2021-10-29 00:00
Medals for the upcoming Beijing  Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games were unveiled in Beijing on Tuesday, starting off the day countdown to the Games. Beijing is making every effort possible to hold a comfortable and successful event for athletes and spectators, as shown by the handbooks it has issued on the epidemic prevention and control protocols in place to ensure the safety of the participants and spectators. It is a pity and shame therefore that there are some who are trying to tarnish the image of this international sports event by calling for a boycott, alleging human rights abuses by the Chinese government. What is insensible and absurd is that in their attempt to politicize the international sports event, these antiChina voices are disregarding the fact that the country has lifted more than  million people out of poverty in the past several decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
