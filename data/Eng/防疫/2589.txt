Different strategies adopted by companies, individuals                     In early March, when most businesses in China had yet to fully resume operations, Zhou Yiyan received inquiries from leading property developer Vanke.  The company wanted suggestions for improving the design of its showrooms, so that more space could be provided for disinfection products.  It requested the information amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has changed mindsets and habits.  Zhou, the founder of Yi Organizer, a studio dedicated to decluttering, or better home organization, said, Property developers are now attaching more importance to customers healthrelated demands as people begin to think about storage space for epidemic prevention products.  Zhou, who was born in Shanghai in , has worked in this emerging industry for five years. Her studio has received three requests for similar consultations so far this year, compared with two in the second half of last year.  Our overall business has grown since the COVID outbreak, and we want to focus more on consultation work with real estate companies, but professional home organizers are under huge pressure, and a number of such jobs have been lost due to the outbreak, Zhou said.  Her studio also has an online training program for home organizers, but this business has fallen by  percent during the pandemic, which has had a significant impact on the economy, especially employment.  Although no target has been set for economic growth in this years Government Work Report, there is a clear and specific aim for employment creating more than  million new urban jobs a surveyed urban unemployment rate of about  percent and a registered urban unemployment rate of around . percent.  Premier Li Keqiang, delivering the Government Work Report to the opening of the third session of the th National Peoples Congress on Friday, said, All local governments need to overhaul or rescind excessive restrictions on employment, and adopt all possible measures to bolster employment.  Statistics from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security show that the registered unemployment rate at the end of last year was . percent, with an additional  million jobs created in urban areas.  Zeng Xiangquan, director of the China Institute for Employment Research at Renmin University of China in Beijing, said The shortterm shock produced by COVID has increased pressure on the Chinese job market, but opportunities often go hand in hand with challenges. Opportunities can be anticipated in areas such as flexible employment, information sharing, targeted talent training, new technological changes and the booming digital economy.  In Zhous case, although some of the students participating in the online program at her studio had earlier lost their jobs, most of them have found ways to survive.  For instance, one of them is learning psychology, especially positive discipline, so she can help accompany clients children, and some of them are trying to give clients fashion tips through online platforms, Zhou said.  She is just one of millions of people striving to restructure their businesses as a result of the pandemic.  New venture  Sun Mingze, who was born in , used to work in the information technology sector. He had a schedule dubbed toiling from  am to  pm, six days a week. However, after working in Beijing for two decades, he had saved enough to start his own business.  After spending more than six months investigating the catering sector in the city, Sun and several other investors opened three mediumsized restaurants last year named Daddy Shrimp. The outlets served differentflavored crayfish. Investment in the business, which mainly went on rent and decoration work, exceeded  million yuan ,.  Just as the venture was about to break even, the COVID outbreak emerged, forcing two of the restaurants to close due to high labor and rental costs.  Sun said The monthly rent for our squaremeter restaurant close to Jianxiang bridge on the northeast Third Ring Road is more than , yuan. We need to pay six months rent in advance, plus an extra months as the mortgage.  At peak times, we have  staff members, and the annual cost of running the restaurant is more than . million yuan. Although weve been given a onemonth rent exemption due to the pandemic, we are still finding it hard to survive.  However, Sun has not given up, and since March he has been trying different forms of catering, starting in the community where he lives.  We set up a platform on WeChat for residents in the community, and I made inquiries about delivering popular fast food such as spicy crayfish and lamb spine to neighbors. The platform organizer agreed, saying this would give people more choice than merely cooking at home, Sun said.  On Jan , he gave his staff members a Spring Festival break. Three of them chose to stay in Beijing, and Sun started his new venture with them.  On April , he received the first order from his community, and now his business has expanded to others nearby.  If I can cover eight communities, the business can break even and I can at least support my staff members livelihoods, Sun said.  For him, the community catering business has provided a way out of the dilemma facing the traditional catering industry, one of the sectors hardesthit by the pandemic.  The investment and potential risk is much lower. You dont need to worry about high rents, and the investment yield is also not bad. The only problem is that you need to devote much more time to serving your customers, Sun said.  He used to spend about four hours looking after his restaurants before the outbreak, but now devotes the whole working day attending to business.  I start work at  am, sending product information to different WeChat groups, answering customers inquiries and looking after their orders. After lunch, I begin to arrange orders and monitor the entire process to ensure product quality. In the evening, I send orders to communities, ensuring that they are all received. Sometimes, I do not complete deliveries until  pm, Sun said.  Despite the hard work, he is determined to continue with his new venture and is considering setting up a kitchen to offer family packages and healthy meals, in addition to the existing fastfood products.  Ive rented a booth close to my community for about , yuan a month. The gross profit is around , yuan a month, and if everything goes smoothly, I can break even in two to three months, Sun said.  After giving customers a brief online summary of his products and prices, Sun also offers them this observation During your childhood, you cry after you tumble if there are people nearby when you grow up, you cry after you tumble if there is nobody nearby when you are middleaged, you are the only one that you can count on.  Fiercer competition  By last month, the number of representatives on Victor Zhaos sales team at the Beijing branch of insurance company AIA had risen from  to , while about , agents were working for the company, compared with , at the end of last year.  Most of the new staff members come from industries hardhit by the pandemic, such as tourism and overseas study consultation businesses, said Zhao, who joined AIAs Beijing branch in , when China become the worlds secondlargest life insurance market. Before this, he was a contract manager for a European multinational company.  One of the new employees at the branch is Ryan Yuan, born in the s, who joined in March. After obtaining a postgraduate degree in the United Kingdom in business management, he worked for an overseas studies consultation company, mainly in the UK and the United States. This sector has been severely affected by the pandemic.  Yuan said I expect it will need at least two years to recover. On the one hand, most overseas schools and colleges have stopped enrollment for the autumn semester. On the other, Chinese parents are not likely to risk their childrens lives if the pandemic is not totally over.  However, unlike when Zhao joined AIA, competition in the insurance sector is now much fiercer.  When I joined AIA four years ago, the Beijing branch had , to , insurance agents, but during a phone call several days ago, one of my friends said five people he knew had joined AIA. A few years ago, I was the only one he knew working for the company.  However, despite a rising number of insurance recruits, slower economic growth has led to reduced consumption. In the first quarter, Chinas GDP contracted by . percent yearonyear, and most economists expect the growth rate to be about  percent this year, mainly due to the pandemic. Last year, the rate was . percent.  The shock waves caused by the outbreak have been farreaching. For example, last year about , agents from the Beijing branch of AIA joined the Million Dollar Round Table, a key industry gauge for highperformance insurance agents. However, this year only  had achieved targets by early this month qualifying them to join, Zhao said.  As AIA pays a great deal of attention to customertailored policies, we need facetoface communication to serve our customers, which is very difficult during the pandemic, he added.  To stand out among the fierce competition, he said he will make more efforts to explore the market for highnetworth individuals, given his legal background.  I believe that adopting a different strategy is very important for both companies and individuals this year, he added.  huyuanyuanchinadaily.com.cn         Production resumes at a cycle factory in Changli, Hebei province, which employs more than , local people.
