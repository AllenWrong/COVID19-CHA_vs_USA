PhotoIC    BEIJING  Rolf Hilgenfeld, a German coronavirus research expert and professor at the Lubeck University, brought two inhibitors developed for SARSCoV to China to test their effects on the  novel coronavirus nCoV, according to China Media Group CMG. Hilgenfeld and his team have been devoted to the research of SARSCoV inhibitors for many years. The inhibitor uses protease acting on the virus to prevent the protein from cracking, thus preventing the formation of the mature virus. At present, the preparation developed by the team is effective in mice infected with SARSCoV and stable in human cell culture experiments. Scientists have found that the nCov is  percent similar to the SARSCoV, and the similarity between the protease of these two viruses is as high as  percent. Hilgenfeld hopes that the inhibitors can help the research on nCov drugs. In an interview with CMG, he said that the experiments on nCov will be carried out on mice, and toxicological experiments will be carried out to eliminate other side effects that may be caused by the drugs. Finally, mass production will be possible only through clinical trials. The coronavirus is selflimiting. After a period of time, when enough people produce antibodies, the continuous spread of the virus can be restricted, thus ending the spread of the epidemic, he said.
