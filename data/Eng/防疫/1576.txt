For instance, some farmers need to purchase fodder and prepare for the spring planting, and some patients need to go out to seek medical treatment.Furthermore, netizens are also concerned about preventing the virus, such as how to wash hands scientifically, he said. With the help of some common knowledge we have prepared, we can provide them some suggestions.They also repeatedly told those who decided to return to Yanshou from other places recently to quarantine themselves at home for at least two weeks.Some netizens sent virtual gifts on the platform for their patience and carefulness.We dont need gifts but need more attention and spread of the information we offer, which may help more locals, said Dong. Despite being exhausted for sitting more than  hours in front of a mobile phone, we will fight until the day we finally win the battle against the epidemic.
