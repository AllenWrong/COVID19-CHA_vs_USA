HK must always remain immune to the separatism virus

In order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus epidemic in Hong Kong, the SAR government initially closed six border checkpoints on Jan  and then four more on Feb , leaving only Hong Kong International Airport, the Hong KongZhuhaiMacao Bridge and Shenzhen Bay Port open to traffic from the mainland. Yet the antiChina and anticommunist political forces in Hong Kong have refused to stop demanding a complete shutdown of the SAR from the mainland. The World Health Organization held an executive board meeting on the coronavirus the same day that the SAR government shut down additional checkpoints. Speaking at the meeting, WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated that there was no need for measures that would unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade while trying to halt the spread of the coronavirus. We call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidencebased and consistent he also said that were it not for Chinas allout efforts, the number of cases outside China would have been much higher. Regarding the virus spread abroad, he said it was minimal and slow.       The vast majority of nations in the world, including most Western countries, have not shut their doors to Chinese nationals. Even though a few countries resorted to this unnecessary measure, the vast majority have offered moral and material support to the government and the people of China. The US government was the first to airlift all consular staff out of Wuhan and completely ban Chinese nationals from American soil. Nonetheless, some US enterprises and institutions have donated relief supplies to China. The other special administrative region of China, Macao, has not closed its door on mainland residents. Although Macao is much smaller in size than Hong Kong, its government and residents remained calm over the nCoV epidemic, in sharp contrast to the recent display of undue panic by some Hong Kong residents. On the mainland, except for Wuhan and some other cities in Hubei province, cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen have not been completely closed to the rest of the country. Wuhan is groundzero of the novel coronavirus outbreak, which is why its surrounding areas have found far more confirmed infection cases than those further afield, and has be completely closed to prevent the epidemic from spreading. Such a sacrifice is made out of universal love. In an attempt to advance their separatist cause and other political objectives in the SAR, the antiChina and anticommunist political forces have established a number of trade unions specifically for those purposes. One of them is the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance. Established in December, it lost little time in thumbing its nose at the sacred duty of medical professionals by staging a strike last week, putting many patients and public health at risk. Meanwhile, some rioters in black reemerged from hiding to wreak havoc yet again, including planting incendiary devices in public hospitals for maximum terror effect. Those acts are proof that the black revolution is far from over. Some people say the black revolution should be considered over, now that the antiChina and anticommunist forces have stopped crying five demands, not one less and few rioters in black remain active as Hong Kong society is overwhelmingly focused on the battle to control the novel coronavirus epidemic. However, the truth is that the opposition forces temporarily put aside their five demands, not one less. Their masterminds and frontline commanders believe that the separatist sentiment the black revolution has fomented was the main reason behind their victory in the District Council elections last year. They believe that if they want to repeat the success in the upcoming Legislative Council election and ultimately seize the office of chief executive, they must turn up the separatist fever as high as possible. Demanding the closure of all border checkpoints is just a secessionist tactic under the guise of controlling the epidemic. As the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance went on strike, the opposition parties lawmakers,  District Council chairpersons and  district councilors acted as cheerleaders with a barrage of joint declarations demanding the SAR cut off all physical access to the mainland. Although their ludicrous demand was turned down by the government, their rhetoric and actions have already fueled separatism in Hong Kong. Five demands, not one less is aimed at seizing the governing power of the SAR and turning Hong Kong into an independent entity. Their demand to shut down all border facilities with the mainland is intended to bar mainland residents from visiting Hong Kong, which will exacerbate secessionism and facilitate their Hong Kong independence agenda. Therefore, politicizing the nCoV epidemic is another manifestation of the black revolution. Since Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuetngor and her team of principal officials are focused on tackling the epidemic as their top priority, they must also see the whole picture of the nationwide campaign, of which Hong Kong is only a small part. They need to follow not only the WHO guidelines on disease control and prevention, but also the central governments direction in formulating Hong Kongs responses to the epidemic organically. It is simply ridiculous to ask the central government for emergency supplies of surgical masks while treating the mainland as an infected zone. The SAR government should certainly do its best to safeguard Hong Kong residents lives and health, but that should not stop it from showing Hong Kong society the importance of treating mainland compatriots as equals. What the SAR government says and does must always contribute to the battle against separatism. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
