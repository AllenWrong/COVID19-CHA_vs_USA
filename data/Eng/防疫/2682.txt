PhotoAgencies    BEIJING  Beijing has required inbound travelers to undergo health monitoring for seven additional days following  days of medical observation, authorities said Saturday. The latest requirement was announced following the meeting of the citys COVID prevention and control leadership group held on Friday. The antiepidemic management at the centralized quarantine venues will be further strengthened and nucleic acid tests targeting related personnel and surroundings will be conducted more frequently, according to the meeting. Recently, there have been cases in Beijing and other cities across the country in which inbound travelers were confirmed as COVID patients after  days of isolated observation, which led to a rebound in indigenous cases. In response to the problem, Beijing earlier this month extended the COVID observation period for inbound travelers to  days following sporadic locally transmitted cases.
