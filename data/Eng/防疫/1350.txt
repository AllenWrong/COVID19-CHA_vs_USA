Serial intervals, which measure the average time between the onset of symptoms in a chain of people infected by a pathogen, have shrunk substantially from . days to . days in around a month on the Chinese mainland, driven by intensive nonpharmaceutical interventions, in particular case isolation, the study said. Benjamin Cowling at the University of Hong Kong and his colleagues compiled a database of , transmission pairs from Jan  to Feb , when the Chinese city of Wuhan was the epicenter of the countrys outbreak. These findings suggest that the early isolation of cases reduced further transmission, leading to fewer cases and curbing the spread of the disease. As a result, most of the remaining transmissions occurred either before symptoms are apparent or early in the symptomatic phase, while the serial interval shortened, according to the study. The researchers hope realtime estimation of serial intervals could be used to track the transmission dynamics of the virus.
