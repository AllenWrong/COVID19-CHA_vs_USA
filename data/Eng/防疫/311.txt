The number of UK coronavirus cases doubled to eight after four more people tested positive for the virus over the weekend, according to the Department of Health. The four new patients, all infected after contact with the UKs third confirmed coronavirus patient in a French ski resort, were transferred to London hospitals for specialist treatment. There have been more than , cases of the virus globally, mostly in China. The total number of deaths in China is now   but the number of newly infected people per day has stabilized. A spokesman for the UKs Department of Health said We are strengthening our regulations so we can keep individuals in supported isolation for their own safety and if public health professionals consider they may be at risk of spreading the virus to other members of the public. This measure will rightly make it easier for health professionals to help keep people safe across the country. The incidence or transmission of novel coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health, and the measures outlined in these regulations are considered as an effective means of delaying or preventing further transmission of the virus. The announcement came after a British businessman who caught the coronavirus at a conference in Singapore is thought to have infected at least seven other Britons after going to France for a skiing holiday. The socalled super spreader is feared to have infected at least seven others with the coronavirus in cases across the UK, France and Spain, prompting the emergency testing of hundreds of people on his flights, ski break and even his local pub. Britains health authorities have contacted  passengers and six crew members who were on an Easyjet flight taken by the man, from Geneva to London, and warned that they could be infected. Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty said on Monday that the new cases are all known contacts of a previously confirmed UK case, and the virus was passed on in France. He said Experts at Public Health England continue to work hard tracing patient contacts from the UK cases. They successfully identified these individuals and ensured the appropriate support was provided. Speaking on the BBC on Sunday, Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick said the UKs National Health Service is ready for any outbreak that could occur as it is always preparing itself for emergencies, or situations of extreme pressure and this is no exception. Meanwhile, the European Commission said it continues to work on all fronts to tackle the outbreak. The Commissioner for Crisis Management at the EUs Emergency Response Coordination Center, Janez Lenarcic, said As the coronavirus outbreak affects more and more countries, coordination and cooperation need to be our main focus. He added Now is the time to join forces in order to stop this epidemic. It is crucial that the entire international community focus on preparedness and response efforts to fight coronavirus, keeping international solidarity in mind. The center is liaising with all EU member states to facilitate the delivery of needed personal protective equipment to China. Chen Weihua in Brussels contributed to this story.
