Proposal on Taiwan politically driven
2020-11-12 00:00
Taiwans ruling Democratic Progressive Party has tried time and again to gain recognition for the island as an independent entity by seeking to participate in World Health Assembly meetings as an observer. But recognition of the oneChina principle is unshakable, and its attempts to falsely portray one China, one Taiwan in the world arena in this way have all met with failure.  This weeks attempt being no exception. On Monday, the WHA turned down a proposal to invite Taiwan to the World Health Organization meeting.  As a United Nations agency, the WHO is composed of sovereign states, and Taiwan, as part of China, is not eligible to join. Hence, the islands participation in the assembly must be dealt with in accordance with the oneChina principle.  From  to , Taiwan participated in the WHA as an observer under the name Chinese Taipei. But the island has been kept out of the assembly since  since its leader Tsai Ingwen of the proindependence DPP took office in May .  In fact it is the DPP that has blocked the islands road to WHA participation. Tsai and the DPP authorities clearly know for the island to return to the WHA they have first to recognize the  Consensus on one China.  The insistence on floating the proposal at the WHA was not about protecting the health and welfare of the people in the region as claimed, but simply aimed at pursuing the DPPs independence willothewisp by politicizing the international response to the COVID pandemic.  As there is an International Health Regulations Contact Point for the island, information exchanges between the island and WHO and other entities are complete and unimpeded. Not to mention that medical and health experts from Taiwan have taken part in the WHOs technical activities under the oneChina principle.  And as Chinas Foreign Ministry has repeatedly pointed out, the central government attaches great importance to the health and wellbeing of Taiwan compatriots, and the islands health authorities have been constantly kept up to date with the latest information on epidemic prevention and control.  In January, the Chinese central government hosted Taiwan epidemic prevention and control experts who traveled to Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, to observe firsthand its novel coronavirus containment efforts.  Therefore, by trying to hijack the WHA, the DPP is endangering the global efforts to fight the virus. It should face reality and stop using the pandemic as an excuse for its political maneuvering.  That the WHA has rejected such Taiwanrelated proposals for many consecutive years should drive home the message that the international community rightly upholds the oneChina principle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
