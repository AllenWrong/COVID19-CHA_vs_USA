He Yaqiong Deputy directorgeneral of the Bureau of Operation Monitoring and Coordination, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology With the global economy in decline, some industries in China have still managed to achieved positive growth. We believe that through joint efforts, the sudden epidemic was only a temporary phenomenon, and it will pass eventually. Chinas economy and the worlds economy will soon usher in a new and bright future.  Xie Jianmin Firstlevel counselor at the Department of International Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs We ensured the stable supply and market prices of agricultural products during the outbreak of COVID. Agriculture was like a ballast while fighting against the epidemic. In the next step, agriculture will continue to play its strategically important role to support development. We hope that this forum can help further promote the openingup of Chinas agriculture industry.  Wang Xinkui Chairman of the Shanghai WTO Affairs Consultation Center I dont think COVID will have a fundamental impact on the globalization of the economy, but it has affected global supply chain security. Chinese enterprises cannot maintain growth without the global supply chain. So how they establish a mechanism to secure the global supply chain in an uncertain international environment is a top priority. The third CIIE will play an important role in forming a new development pattern that supports each other at home and abroad.  Jeongmin Seong Partner at the McKinsey Global Institute Globalization is currently undergoing some structural changes, which indicates the second half of globalization development has just begun. COVID is accelerating the process. Globalization will feature three characteristics, which are regionalization, servicecentered and digitalization. Companies will have more flexibility for shortened supply chains and improved efficiency. Domestic supply chains in developing countries such as China and India will be further improved.  David Aikman Chief representative officer at the World Economic Forum in China The pandemic demands the global cooperation among governments, international organizations and business community. Ive been thrilled to see a number of Chinese companies stepping up during the virus outbreak. We are very encouraged about Chinas efforts, not only in terms of driving growth and recovery, but also the statements by the leaders of Chinese government about repairing and resetting the global multilateral system, so we look forward to Chinas continued leadership and openingup.  John Denton Secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce How do we trade in an era in which global disruptions like the COVID could become more frequent? One very clear next step is to take advantage of technological capabilities available to us to digitalize trade. Our aim is to take the analogous trading world, and turn it into a digital world. We will give the same legal recognition to digital documents in transactions as we do to paper. This will improve efficiency, reduce cost and shorten delays dramatically.  Zhang Xinyuan Deputy general manager at Bank of China Shanghai Branch The sales revenue of many companies has dropped by  to  percent yearonyear due to the virus outbreak, which has triggered a new financial demand. As a commercial bank, we have to serve goals in six areas including securing employment in response to the central governments requirements. We also have to manage risks and provide financial support to businesses. We are making sure we carry out our social responsibilities while also maintain good risk control.  Gu Yue Party secretary and chairman of the board at CPIC Property Insurance The financial industry has abundant resources which can be channeled into the economy. It should bear a responsibility of supporting business resumption. It is also a key function of the insurance industry. We have developed plans to help businesses resume production, and as a result secure peoples livelihoods. The plans benefit frontline workers in the battle against the virus, and workers and projects in the country taking part in the Belt and Road Initiative. They also benefit makers of medical supplies, vaccine developers and small and mediumsized enterprises.  Fabrice Megarbane President and chief executive officer at LOreal China For us, our global supply chain is an integrated global network. This connection among all the facilities is one of the key factors that allow us to resume to work quite fast in China. Our global supply network is also connected in terms of being a system of demands. Being able to sense the demands of endconsumers and to respond in a fast and agile way with our factory and production is also a key factor for the rebound. We also partner with all our suppliers to be able to bring solutions to respond clearly to the outbreak of crisis.

There are three major trends that will set the stage for any kind of future adjustment. Supply chain localization has really been put in focus. The security and availability of products will be reinforced by tight supply control. For nonnational strategic industries, it will drive lowend manufacturing from China likely to Southeast Asia. For expertled industries, there will be an adjustment from all players across the entire value chain and industrial structure.
