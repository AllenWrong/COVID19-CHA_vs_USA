A G experience event was held in Taiyuan on April , allowing visitors the chance to get to grips with ultrahigh definition streaming, highspeed network connections and realtime virtual reality transmission.The event was held by the Shanxi branch of China Unicom and information technology giant Huawei.Yuan Xiaoshen, an online movie enthusiast, was among the excited visitors during the event.Its amazing that it takes less than  seconds to download a highdefinition movie of one gigabyte. Thats the amazing speed of G, Yuan said.The event was held two days after the government of Shanxi announced the latest developments in the commercialization of G technologies.At a news conference on April , Zhang Zhanxiang, deputy chief and spokesman of the Shanxi Department of Industry and Information Technology, told the media the province has recently achieved breakthroughs in the G communications industry.According to Zhang, more than , G base stations have been built and operational in Shanxi as of the end of March. All  prefecturelevel cities in the province have drafted their G network development plans.In addition, G networks deployed by the three major telecom operatorsChina Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecomcover all major urban areas in the  cities.While residents pin their hopes on G changing their lives, local market players and industrial officials are more optimistic about G applications in industries.While the G infrastructure is in place, we will shift our focus to industrialized use of the new technologies, said Wu Jin, chief of the Shanxi Communications Administration Bureau.The official cited the example of Huozhou Coal Electricity Group, which is currently promoting the use of G technologies to manage its coal mines and other production sites.The group based in Huozhou, Shanxi province, signed a cooperation agreement with China Unicom to explore G applications, including artificial intelligence, big data and augmented reality, in coal and electricity production.In May , the group launched its first smart mine and equipment inspection and monitoring system at its Pangpangta Mine, with the help of China Unicom, marking the beginning of its largescale application of G in its production.The system can greatly improve safety and efficiency at our mines and production sites through such technologies as remote sensing, remote diagnoses and realtime data transmission and processing, said Yan Lila, an executive at Pangpangta Mine.He added the smart system can be upgraded to cover more functions in the future, including smart transportation, smart ventilation and other remotely controlled operations.Wu from the Shanxi Communications Administration Bureau cited G applications in the prevention and control of the COVID epidemic.One example is a G thermal imaging system used to monitor body temperatures in crowded public venues.Wu said G technologies will be widely used in such fields as manufacturing, transportation, power transmission, healthcare and education.The broader applications of G demand closer collaborations among industrial players, telecom operators and equipment providers, he said.Guo Yanjie contributed to this story.?                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
