Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday that some US politicians connection of the novel coronavirus with China is stigmatization, which China strongly condemns and firmly opposes.He made the remark when asked to respond at a news conference to United States President Donald Trumps earlier remark on social media that referred to novel coronavirus as a Chinese virus.We urge the US side to immediately correct its mistake and stop making groundless accusations against China, he said, adding that the World Health Organization and the international community had explicitly opposed connecting the virus with a certain country or region.Given that the epidemic is spreading across the world, Geng said the top priority now is cooperation in combating the virus. The US should mind its own business first and meanwhile play a constructive role in international epidemic cooperation and in safeguarding global public health, he added.Trumps reference came nearly a week after Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a US House hearing that it was wrong and inappropriate to use such labels as Chinese coronavirus, as the virus had expanded beyond China and severely affected other parts of the world.Rick Dunham, a veteran journalist and former president of the National Press Club in Washington, DC, told China Daily on Monday Viruses do not have a nationality. I think it is objectionable in all cases to connect a disease, a virus, with a geographical location, because diseases are not national, they are global.Dunham said that the outbreak is bringing out the best and the worst in people around the world, in terms of communities getting together and people sacrificing, but also with some playing a blame game.The enemy is the virus. The enemy is not another country, he said.It is always a bad idea when there is a pandemic to have a country name attached to it, he said.The Spanish Flu of  to  did not originate in Spain, and Spain was not responsible. I think that the best practice was the Ebola outbreak. You didnt see coverage saying the African Ebola outbreak, Dunham said.Judy Chu, a member of the US House of Representatives, tweeted on Monday that people should stop calling the novel coronavirus a Chinese virus, as this has led to racism and violence.Long Xingchun, an adjunct senior fellow at Beijing Foreign Studies Universitys Academy of Regional and Global Governance, said that by stigmatizing China, some US officials are not only ignoring the WHOs suggestion not to relate the virus with any country, but are also trying to mask domestic criticism of the US administrations failure to promptly contain the outbreak.Using inappropriate words to describe the virus when there is no scientific basis for its origin is an attempt to distract the public in the US, Long said.Pan Mengqi contributed to this story.Contact the writers at mojingxichinadaily.com.cn?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
