Fears that people burning offerings to honor ancestors could spark forest fires amid dry climate                                  During Qingming Festivalor Tomb Sweeping Dayresidents in North Chinas Shanxi province were told by the local government to use safer methods when paying tribute to their ancestors and deceased family members. The requirements were proposed due to the high risk of fire and the novel coronavirus pandemic. Traditional practices during Tomb Sweeping Day, which falls around April , include clearing weeds in graveyards and burning incense, candles and paper sacrificial offerings as well as setting off fireworks. The burning of things and fireworks are highly risky in forests and on grasslands, especially in the dry weather of spring. According to a domestic media report, a forest fire in Xichang, Sichuan province, on March , killed  firefighters and a local guide. The accident rang the alarm for governments throughout the country, including Shanxi. On April , the provincial government of Shanxi started a weeklong campaign to prevent fires in forests and grasslands. During the first fireprevention weeklong event in Shanxi, officials in various regions spread fire prevention advice among residents via TV broadcasts and mobile phone text messages. The provinces law enforcement institutions have also dispatched task forces to patrol near graveyards, to prevent risky practices. In Qinyuan, a county boasting the highest forest coverage in Shanxi province, the government made the highest level of fire response. The county has established a smart fire monitoring and early warning system, using helicopters and drones on hour patrol and  infrared cameras on watch towers. During Tomb Sweeping Day, the county also mobilized firefighting officers, officials and forestry workers to carry out various fireprevention tasks. A fleet of  vehicles patrolled the county, while hundreds of forestry workers have been on duty at plus watch towers and at more than  checkpoints. The countys  forestry firefighting officers, , officials and more than , volunteers have been in place to deal with any emergencies. Heading the task forces is Jin Suojun, Party secretary of Qinyuan. He visited the countys  townships to make sure all fireprevention measures had been carried out. In Yangqu, another county with high forestry coverage, there are manned checkpoints on the roads to forest areas. Their duty is to ban kindling and inflammable materials being taken into forests. At Wanbailin forest farm in the suburbs of Taiyuan, the provincial capital, all kinds of smart equipment are used in fire prevention. At the fire monitoring center of the forest farm, a big screen is divided into  sections, showing images caught by cameras in different areas. Lu Tong, head of the monitoring center, explained how the system works. Every camera is placed at the highest point of an area and can take pictures of locations within a radius of  kilometers during the daytime, Lu said. During the nighttime, the cameras will shift to infrared mode, which can identify spots of fire or smoke in  km, he said. In the case of an emergency, the big screen shows the exact location immediately, he added. The official said the ,hectare forest farm used to rely on  patrolling workers for fire monitoring and prevention. He added that one worker can only walk around a dozen kilometers a day in some cliff areas, so the smart system has greatly improved work efficiency. While increasing manpower to monitor forests and grasslands, local officials also advocated safer ways of tomb sweeping. In Changzi county in the southeast of Shanxi, local authorities called on residents to lay flowers instead of burning paper sacrificial offerings. Yu Bo, who has run a flower store in the county for five years, said his sales increased heavily during this years Tomb Sweeping Day. I began to receive orders a week before the festival. Flowers like white and yellow chrysanthemums are the most popular, Yu said. Li Quanfu, a civil affairs official in Taiyuans Wanbailin district, suggested tomb sweepers offer cold food as tribute to their ancestors. People always believe its a tradition to burn incense sticks and papermade sacrificial offering during Qingming Festival, he said. However, offering cold food is an even longer tradition, as we have celebrated Qingming together with Cold Food Festival for more than , years in China. And both festivals are dedicated to our ancestors,Li explained. In Shanxi, tomb sweeping in large public cemeteries was affected by the novel coronavirus epidemic. People are advised not to visit cemeteries in a bid to avoid crowding and crossinfection. In this circumstance, people can ask cemetery workers to sweep tombs for them or pay homage to the deceased on cemetery websites. The workers can visit the graves, clear the weeds around the tombs, present flowers, fruits and food and deliver memorial speeches for people who apply for the service, said Yang Yong, a manager at the Yongan Cemetery in Taiyuan. All the rituals of tomb sweeping will be recorded by video cameras and sent to the clients, Yang said. He added that more than  clients ordered the service. To mark their great contributions during the COVID outbreak, we offer free tomb sweeping services to medical workers in Shanxi, Yang said. Wang Chong, a folk culture researcher in Shanxi, noted that Tomb Sweeping Day is an important occasion for Chinese people. It is a common practice in China for people to travel thousands of kilometers to pay tribute to their ancestors during the festival, Wang said. However, Qingming is not the only occasion in the year for this purpose, he added. Wang noted that the Zhongyuan Festival on the th day of the seventh lunar month and the Winter Clothing Festival on the first day of the th lunar month can be options for people to pay tribute to their beloved ones in another world.
