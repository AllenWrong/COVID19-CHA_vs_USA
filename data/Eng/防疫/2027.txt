A digital billboard showing Be Strong China, conveying support to China in fighting the novel coronavirus epidemic, is seen at Shibuya in Tokyo, Japan on Monday. DU XIAOYIXINHUA    Poetry and calligraphy showcase bonds as Tokyo reaches out to offer assistance When the American writer Patrick Rothfuss said, Words can light fires in the minds of men, words can wring tears from the hardest hearts, could he possibly have imagined that some words would be powerful enough even after a , years to still produce tears? Well that is exactly what happened. As China fights against the novel coronavirus, many sayings have been circulating on Chinese social media recently with one thing in common they were written in Chinese and printed on packages donated to China by Japan. Among them, one saying, written about , years ago by a Japanese prince was sent to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, together with masks and infrared thermometers. It read Even though the landscapes are diverse, we share the wind and moon under the same sky. Chen Wan, who works in the international office of Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, said Tears welled up in my eyes when I saw the words on the package. Chen, who regularly deals with the Japanese in the course of her work, said she is very grateful for Japans help. These words have greatly encouraged Wuhans people. China and Japan both have Confucian cultural origins and some things that the Japanese have done have make me feel that Wuhan is not alone in this fight, and that we will eventually conquer this epidemic because we are protected by love and friendship. Of course, helping those in hardship can come in many forms, something that Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the directorgeneral of the World Health Organization, would no doubt have had in mind when he made a plea at a forum on the novel coronavirus in Geneva on Tuesday. The serious measures China is taking in Wuhan and other cities against virus calls for countries to show solidarity with China, he said.        A Japanese girl raised funds for Chinas fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak on Feb  in Tokyo. XINHUA    Political solidarity Its a test of political solidaritywhether the world can come together to fight a common enemy that does not respect borders or ideologies. Its a test of financial solidaritywhether the world will invest now in fighting this outbreak, or pay more later to deal with its consequences. And its a test of scientific solidaritywill the world come together to find shared answers to shared problems? Universal love is a core concept of Confucianism, something that was evident when Toshihiro Nikai, the secretarygeneral and a heavyweight of Japans ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told the media on Monday that all members of his party in the Diet would each donate , yen  to China. Its natural to help a neighboring country if something happens there, Nikai said. Earlier on Friday, Nikai, , at a meeting with Chinas Ambassador to Japan, Kong Xuanyou, said A friend in need is a friend indeed. Japan will stand together with China and will mobilize the entire country to provide support and assistance to help fight the epidemic. At the same meeting, Tetsuo Saito, the secretarygeneral of Japans Komeito Party, said that the enhanced collaboration between Japan and China would help prevent the spread of the virus and overcome it soon. While facing the epidemic, the world has shown it is a community with a shared future, said Long Xingchun, a professor at the School of Foreign Languages at China West Normal University. Long said he appreciated the fact that apart from sending medical materials, Japan used ancient poetry, the cultural connection between China and Japan, to get closer to the Chinese public and to strengthen friendship with China. Cultural connections Echoing Long, Hirotake Ran, a professor of East Asian studies at Musashino University in Tokyo, said Cultural connections have shown their power in bringing people together in this common fight It makes people feel compassion and love for all, which is extremely important at a time like this. Beyond poetry, another cultural connection between China and Japan is calligraphy. In a video shot at his home, Tomiichi Murayama, , a former Japanese prime minister, wrote Wuhan, jiayou stay strong in Chinese characters and shouted out the message in solidarity with the Chinese. Inspired by the poetry, Yukio Hatoyama, another former Japanese prime minister, wrote the yearold saying himself and said in a video expressing his support I want to send this message to my friends who are fighting the virus in Wuhan, in Hubei province, and all over China. We are in a community with a shared future for mankind, and I hope everybody can survive these difficult times. Rebecca Li, a crosscultural etiquette expert in Beijing, said Japan is the closest country to China in terms of culture. While many countries have offered their support to China, Japan stands out, partly because of the cultural resonance between China and Japan. The Chinese feel particularly good when seeing the ancient poetry on the packages of the donations. These poems are all expressions of friendship and goodwill, making people feel that a better SinoJapanese relationship is assured.
