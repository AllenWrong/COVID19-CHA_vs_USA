As a result, the pandemic has been alleviated, said Dai Bing, Chinas deputy permanent representative to the United Nations.That said, the pandemic is still spreading globally, and regional cooperation shall by no means be relaxed. The UN Regional Office for Central Africa UNOCA must help countries in the region in joint prevention and control, and promote cooperation in information sharing, testing methods, and clinical treatment, Dai told a Security Council meeting on UNOCA.China has provided the region with multiple shipments of antiepidemic supplies, and has dispatched medical experts to the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC, the Republic of the Congo, Sao Tome and Principe, and Angola. China remains committed to offering further assistance, he said.Dai asked for efforts to support countries in Central Africa in their economic recovery and development, which is severely affected by the pandemic and is facing increasing downward risks.The international community has the obligation to help them maintain macroeconomic stability, expand job opportunities, and ensure a secure and smooth industrial chain and supply chain, he said.China has been actively implementing the Group of  G debt service suspension initiative, and is a country that has honored the largest amount in this regard among G members. China has helped Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, the DRC, Angola, and other countries in the region overcome difficulties, he said.Dai asked UNOCA to urge the developed countries and multilateral financial agencies to speed up actions and honor their commitments at an early date so as to genuinely alleviate the debt burden of the region.
