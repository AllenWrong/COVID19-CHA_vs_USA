Despite the COVID outbreak, Yamazaki Yumiko decided to return to China early from her hometown in Japans Sendai city in late January. Yamazaki, , runs a foreign language institute with her husband in Changchun, capital of Chinas Jilin province. I had planned to return on Feb  after spending the Spring Festival holiday with my son, who is studying in a college in Japan, she said. When I got the news that the educational institutes might be asked to suspend classes due to the epidemic, I decided to come back to take online classes for my students even though neither my husband nor my son agreed with me. Besides, I wanted to stay with my Chinese students, friends and relatives through their hard days, she said. I will never forget the day when a magnitude  earthquake hit eastern Japan in March . Local residents showed full support and sent their best wishes to my motherland. Back then, local Chinese hung banners that said, Stay Strong, Japan along the busiest streets of Changchun, she recalled. Some college students volunteered to raise donations for the disaster rescue.
