The US aggressive approach increased regional security risks and broke the common will of countries in the area to keep the peace and stability of the South China Sea, Li added. We urged the US to focus on the prevention and control of its domestic epidemic while making efforts to the global fight against the pandemic, and immediately cease conducting military operations that damage regional security and stability, Li said.
