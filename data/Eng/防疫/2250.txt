Since the outbreak of the contagion earlier this year, most domestic airlines suspended their inflight hot food services due to people traveling less and social distancing precautions placed on planes. Now, as the domestic air travel market gradually picks up and the epidemic gets under control in China, airlines are working on resuming and expanding their food offerings onboard. This month, Haikoubased Hainan Airlines upgraded its inflight meals and introduced new dishes for both business and economy class. For flights with durations of more than  minutes, economyclass passengers will be offered hot food. The meals include rice or noodles paired with local cuisines of the departure cities. For breakfast, there are options like fried noodles, fried rice, Chinese pastries and marinated egg. Stateowned Air China will provide upgraded meals such as braised beef brisket with tomatoes, fried rice with mushroom and sliced chicken and roast pork with honey sauce for inflight meals. The carrier has improved its set meal in taste, ingredients and design for economy class after gathering opinions, it said. Currently, China is at a stage of regular epidemic control and prevention. Most Chinese carriers have resumed the offerings of inflight meals, and many of them have launched upgraded meals, as they hope to stay competitive and draw more passengers after they suffered losses during the pandemic, said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist for Carnoc, one of Chinas largest civil aviation websites.
