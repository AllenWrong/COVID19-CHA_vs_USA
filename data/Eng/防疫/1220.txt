China planning to inoculate  percent of its population by June, SinoUS forum told                    China plans to vaccinate  percent of its population by June, with vaccine capacity reaching . billion doses by the end of , Chinese medical experts told their counterparts in the United States during a virtual forum that underscored the need for the two countries to cooperate in fighting the pandemic.By Sunday, China had administered . million doses of COVID vaccines, inoculating . percent of the population. That ratio is expected to rise to  percent by the end of June, Zhong Nanshan, head of a highlevel expert group of Chinas National Health Commission, said on Monday.The mutating COVID virus will decrease the effectiveness of vaccination and also decrease the effectiveness of antibody treatments, according to Zhong, a renowned respiratory expert.The key point is for the world to receive vaccines as soon as possible the longer until you receive vaccines, the more mutation of the virus, he told the forum, which was hosted by the Brookings Institution and Tsinghua University.This will make it all the more important for the world to speed up vaccine production and prepare some new types of vaccines that are sensitive to the variants of the virus, an effort that calls for China and the US to cooperate, Zhong said.Zhang Wenhong, director of the Department of Infectious Disease at Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, said the current vaccination pace is really low in China because the outbreak control was so good in China in the early stage.But Chinas vaccineproduction capacity warrants no concern, since the country is well able to produce . billion doses by the end of , Zhang said.However, global vaccination is currently highly unbalanced, as full vaccine coverage can be achieved only in the United States, Europe and a few other countries such as China and Russia, he told the forum.Zhang said that historically, a global epidemic has required global collaboration that transcends politics, and that China and the US as major vaccine producers have the responsibility to implement their own vaccination strategies and also to help with mass immunization in the rest of the world.We should not just take into account the vaccination by ourselves. We should have taken into account the vaccination of lessdeveloped countries, he said.John Allen, president of the Washingtonbased Brookings Institution, said the US and China have a long history of constructive and productive collaboration to combat diseases, including SARS in , the HN influenza virus in  and Ebola in .If China and the United States joined forces to fight COVID, the world will have a better chance to emerge from the pandemic stronger, he said. But if these two great countries fail to take action together, the world will in turn become weaker and more divided.Thomas Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said vaccine nationalism will backfire, and only global collaboration against the virus can lead to global recovery.Were all in this together. The only enemy here is a virus, and the more we are united, the more effectively we will be able to fight that virus, Frieden said. This is the worlds moment to work together, and the US and China have a unique role to play.As the peak of the pandemic has passed, the future direction of the epidemic will depend on a combination of three factors public health measures, vaccination coverage, and how enduring the protection provided by vaccines proves to be, according to Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Gao Fu, director of the Chinese CDC, said he expected an approximate normal by next summer. Gao called for the US and China to work together to boost the COVID Vaccine Global Access COVAX initiative and promote vaccine equity.Xue Lan, a nonresident senior fellow of foreign policy at the Brookings Institutions John L.Thornton China Center, also said theres an urgent need for the global community, particularly the US and China, to join forces to stop the pandemic.With addressing COVID the top priority for leaders in both Washington and Beijing, it is a critical time for collaboration, Xue told the forum.huanxinzhaochinadailyusa.com?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
