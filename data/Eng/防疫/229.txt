Vietnams quick action on COVID lauded

After effectively beating two waves of COVID infections, Vietnam is demonstrating how a country with limited resources can control the virus. The main reason behind Vietnams success, according to Guy Thwaites, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City, is the speed of the countrys response. As of Friday, Vietnam has been free of local COVID transmission for  days after a clean run of months earlier this year. Even before its first COVID case was reported on Jan , the Vietnamese government had ordered ministries and agencies to be prepared to take drastic measures. Again, in July, when an infection was reported in the city of Da Nang after nearly  days of zero community transmission, it also quickly rolled out measures including massive testing and a regional lockdown. The response by the Southeast Asian nationwhich in  was ranked by the World Health Organization, based on overall health performance, as th among  member stateshas stood out in the global fight against the pandemic. The countrys total confirmed cases numbered ,, of which  were local transmissions, according to the official Vietnam News Agency. A total of  deaths were reported, all older people with severe chronic diseases. Hospitals have discharged a total of , patients. Meanwhile, nearly , people are being quarantined and monitored in the country. Vietnam is a relatively resourcelimited country and therefore, their response was not a hightech one, but a very wellorganized and rapid response that involved a very good basic principle of epidemiology, which was identifying cases, said Thwaites. The country has been mobilizing a large number of people to conduct contacttracing and isolate those who are infected or have had contact with someone infected by the virus. Another reason for the countrys success is effective communication with the public and increased trust by the population, Thwaites said, adding that people in Vietnam have been very compliant with control measures. Maurizio Trevisan, dean of the College of Health Sciences at VinUniversity in Hanoi, said, Having an immediate strategy of action does not only reduce the number of infected individuals, but actually protects the healthcare system, so people who go to the hospital can be successfully treated. Despite a low testing ratio of around , to , per  million people, Vietnam acted swiftly to conduct targeted testing and therefore make full use of its resources, Trevisan said. Vietnams success has been lauded by the international community. In an interview with local media The Voice of Vietnam, Kidong Park, the WHOs representative in Vietnam, praised the governments drastic action since the beginning of the outbreak. Although some countries are trying to replicate methods similar to those taken by Vietnam, such as selective lockdowns of highrisk areas, Thwaites from the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit said the problem is that they have already missed the window for when the virus situation can be brought under control. When I look at the United Kingdom and Europe, for example, there are clearly areas that have higher rates of infections and require more stringent control measures, said Thwaites. But there arent any areas that are free from the infection. Trevisan of VinUniversity said that in Asia, COVID has not been treated as political football, whereas in some Western countries, it has been used by politicians for purposes that have nothing to do with public health. Noting the importance of taking immediate action to control and prevent the infectious disease, Trevisan said most Asian countries have done so, which can be attributed to their experience with the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in  and . Vietnams effective response to the virus will help its economic recovery, according to Adam McCarty, chief economist with research and consulting firm Mekong Economics in Hanoi. Vietnam is forecast to be one of the few economies in Asia to show positive growth in . The government has tried balancing economic growth and pandemic control since the beginning, said McCarty. Vietnams economy is growing because domestic demand is strong due to the successful control of COVID, McCarty said. Noting that both China and Vietnam have been successful in dealing with COVID, Trevisan said he expects the two countries, having formed strong connections, to continue their partnership on the scientific and public health level. kellychinadailyapac.com ?
