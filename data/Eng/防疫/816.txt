Local clinics to offer vaccination services Provinces other than Hubei should resume full vaccination services that have been halted due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the National Health Commission said. In a statement issued on its website on March , the commission said provincial health authorities should guide their vaccination clinics in making and implementing plans to prevent the transmission of novel coronavirus infections when resuming services. Local centers for disease control and prevention should help the clinics offer vaccine appointments online or over the phone. Priority should be given to vaccinations required by the national immunization program but interrupted by the outbreak, as well as overdue booster shots of other vaccines. The clinics should set a daily cap on the number of people who get vaccinated and reduce the time they wait in clinics. They should also avoid people gathering in the clinics for observation after vaccination. In Hubei, the provincial Health Commission should adjust the provinces vaccination work plan according to the development of the novel coronavirus epidemic, the commission said. Healthcare institutions in the province should prioritize the administering of the first dose of hepatitis B and tuberculosis vaccines for newborns, while implementing strict local policies to contain the novel coronavirus.
