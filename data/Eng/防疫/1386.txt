PhotoAgencies    Results from Scotland offer hope for bringing the pandemic under control Hospitalizations from COVID have plummeted in Scotland since the nation began its inoculation campaign, according to new analysis that shows how vaccinations can prevent severe illness and ease pressure on health services. Scotland is using two vaccinesone from Pfizer and BioNTech, the other from Oxford University and AstraZenecaand data shows that the treatments reduced COVID hospitalizations by  percent and  percent respectively between Dec  and Feb . During this period, . million people in Scotland received their first shot, representing  percent of the population. The analysis was conducted by five Scottish universitiesEdinburgh, Strathclyde, Aberdeen, Glasgow, and St Andrewsin conjunction with Public Health Scotland, or PHS. These results are very encouraging and have given us great reasons to be optimistic for the future, said Aziz Sheikh, who is the projects lead researcher from Edinburgh University. We now have national evidenceacross an entire countrythat vaccination provides protection against COVID hospitalizations. Rollout of the first vaccine dose now needs to be accelerated globally to help overcome this terrible disease. In Scotland, , people have had the Pfizer shot and , have received the Oxford vaccine. During the period, the researchers analyzed data including general practitioner records on vaccination, hospital admissions, death registrations, and laboratory test results, and compared the outcomes of those who had received their first jab with those who had not. Combined data from both vaccines showed that people aged  years and olderwhich is one of the most vulnerable groupsreceived  percent reduced risk of hospitalization. These data show real promise that the vaccines we have given out can protect us from the severe effects of COVID, said Josie Murray, who is a consultant epidemiologist for PHS. Chris Robertson, a professor of public health epidemiology at the University of Strathclyde, said that the results give a reason to be more optimistic about the control of the epidemic. Murray cautioned that this research is not concerned with whether vaccines can stop the spread of the virus. We must not be complacent though, we all still need to ensure we stop transmission of the virus, and the best way we can all do this is to follow public health guidance, Murray said. We also all need to protect ourselves, our families, and friends by taking the second dose of vaccine when it is offered. As of Monday afternoon, more than . million people in Scotland had been tested for COVID. Of these, , had tested positive, and , people had died.
