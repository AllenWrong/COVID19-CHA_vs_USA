Global war against novel coronavirus call for all countries to close ranks

On Wednesday, the number of people newly infected with the novel coronavirus outside of China  exceeded the number in China  for the first time since the outbreak of the virus, and except for Antarctica, the virus has now spread to all continents. As such, although the World Health Organization has not yet declared it to be a global pandemic, the window of opportunity to control the spread of the virus, which has been hard earned by China at great cost, is closing quickly. The improving situation in China shows that quick and decisive measures taken by the authorities to reduce population mobility and concentrate medical resources in the hardesthit region at an early date can make a big difference. It is obvious that some countries that have watched Chinas efforts with folded arms are now looking at its taillights and the time it will take them to catch up with it in the race to contain the virus will come at the cost of lives lost and economic losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
