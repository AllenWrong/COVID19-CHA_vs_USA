Prevention is the most effective and economic strategy, and the operation of disease prevention institutions should be improved.  The system of surveillance for unknown diseases and abnormal health incidents should be reformed and risks should be analyzed at an early stage.  The key to epidemic monitoring and early warning lies in timeliness and accuracy.  Coordinated efforts must be made in the response of hospitals, cooperation between regions and mobilization of personnel in emergencies.  Laws and rules concerning public health emergencies should be improved, and awareness of public health risks should be raised among all citizens. ?A gale can pass through a small hole. The work of epidemic prevention and control must not cease for a single moment.
