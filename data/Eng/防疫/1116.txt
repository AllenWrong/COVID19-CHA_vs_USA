Officials also tout Chinese characteristics in promoting harmonious coexistence of people and nature                                  The establishment of a protected area system with national parks as the main body and a unified, standardized and efficient national park system with Chinese characteristics is an important way to ensure national ecological security. Its also vital for realizing the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature. National parks in China refer to specific land or sea areas approved by government officials to protect a large area of natural ecosystems. Naming an area a national park considers national representativeness as its main purpose, but officials also hope to realize scientific protection and rational use of natural resources. The primary function of a national park is to protect the authenticity and integrity of important natural ecosystems. It also has comprehensive functions such as scientific research, education and recreation. China has established a pilot system for  national parks of the ThreeRiverSource, Northeast China Tiger and Leopard, Giant Pandas, Qilian Mountain, Hainan Tropical Rainforest, Shennongjia, Wuyishan, Qianjiangyuan, Nanshan, and Pudacuo. They comprise a variety of animals, landscapes and plants, and cover  provinces including Qinghai, Jilin and Hainan, with a combined area of more than , square kilometers, accounting for . percent of the countrys total land area. Tian Yongchen, deputy director of the National Park Administration of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, said The national park is not a park in the general sense that the public understands. The main purpose is to protect a large area of natural ecosystems with national representativeness. It is a specific land or sea area and is one of the most important types of nature reserves. Tian said that national parks have three major concepts overall protection of natural ecosystems, important natural ecosystems with unique natural landscapes and rich scientific connotations, and adherence to public welfare. In November , the Chinese government proposed for the first time the establishment of a national park system. In December , a pilot national park system was launched. In December , the National Forestry and Grassland Administration completed the thirdparty assessment and acceptance of the pilot national park system. In October , China officially established the first group of national parks, opening a new chapter in their construction. Yang Rui, dean of the National Park Research Institute of Tsinghua University, said national parks are the first concept of ecological protection. They are the most critical areas in protective shields for ecological security. The ecosystem has no national boundaries. Many of the national parks we have established are precious pieces of natural heritage, and we will protect them, Yang said. For example, Wuyi Mountain is regarded as the most important area for ecological protection and provides a model for ecological protection and restoration. It has played a demonstrative and leading role in the international community. We plan to divide the national parks into two control areas One is called the core protection area, in which manmade activities are forbidden. Other places are called general control areas, which are said to be open areas, Yang said. I think that the strictest protection of national parks is consistent with the ecological experience and nature education of national parks. The national park actually allows ecological experience and nature education, he added. Otherwise, it would be classified as a nature reserve, which is to distinguish the nature education and ecological experience of the national park from the tourism industry we traditionally think of. Significant results have been achieved in the construction and management of national parks, natural forest protection, grassland restoration, and forest resource management and protection. Since the nations pilot program launched, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance have allocated a total of . billion yuan . million to support the construction of infrastructure in natural parks, such as facilities for patrol and monitoring, forest and grassland fire prevention, field rescue and epidemic prevention and control as well as publicity and education, and national park surveys. A total of , positions for ecological management and protection have been set up in  pilot areas, participating in park patrol work, and becoming the main force in national park ecological protection. Hao Yujun, director of the Science and Technology Department of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, said national parks are rich in popular science resources. Their development allows people to experience nature and increase their knowledge. ?       ? ?        A birdseye view of the ThreeRiverSource National Park, Qinghai province.
