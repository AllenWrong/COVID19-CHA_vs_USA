Private sector should help fight pandemic
2020-04-02 08:31
Hong Kong is not only threatened by the spreading COVID pandemic partly due to irresponsible individual behavior but also a shortage of hospital beds equipped to prevent crosscontamination. In order to effectively contain the spread of the novel coronavirus in the city  one of the most densely populated in the world  the SAR government has stepped up efforts such as banning gatherings of more than four people in public venues and heavier deterrence against quarantine violations. However, a sudden influx of Hong Kong residents from overseas, mainly college students fleeing foreign cities hit by the COVID pandemic as well, has created a wave of confirmed infection cases. As a result, all available isolation wards at public hospitals are now fully occupied, but more than  patients are waiting for negative pressure wards because the turnover rate at public hospitals cannot keep up with the increase of infected cases. It is fair to say the SAR government has done its best to handle the public health emergency situation effectively, thanks in part to its experience containing the SARS epidemic  years ago. Nevertheless, the current war on COVID is much more difficult and Hong Kong was caught underprepared, as were most if not all developed economies in the world. They share the inherent constraints of free markets and private ownership, which leave the government with more challenges than options when it comes to emergency management solutions. As such, they have invariably become victims of their own prejudices in more ways than one, compared with what the Chinese mainland has achieved in getting the situation under control. Hong Kong has benefited a lot from an early start and experience in handling the SARS crisis but has still fallen short in front of the unprecedented scale and severity of the COVID pandemic. Given the growing danger of losing control over the public health emergency situation, it is time the SAR government enlisted the private sector more than it has ever done under such circumstances while utilizing all public resources at its disposal to ease the shortage of negative pressure facilities. In addition to using vacant isolation wards at private hospitals, the health authorities should consider converting small hotels in less densely populated districts into temporary normal pressure isolation wards to help ease the pressure on public hospitals. If these private establishments are not enough, the government may have to ask local universities and colleges for help. Meanwhile, the deteriorating epidemic situation in Hong Kong, as evidenced by the doubling of confirmed COVID cases in just a week to over , justifies the governments latest move on Wednesday to tighten restrictions on private as well as public gatherings throughout the city, such as the temporary shutdown of all karaoke lounges, mahjong parlors, beauty parlors, massage establishments, nightclubs and clubhouses. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures, and no one is exempt from responsibility.       ?                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
