Compared with the Qingming Festival holiday in April, domestic tourism consumption during the May Day holiday has rebounded significantly. As epidemic prevention and control becomes normal in China, the tourism consumption during May Day holiday this year has shown some new features compared with the past few years. Notably, more domestic residents enjoy leisure tour rather than travelling trips. The shortdistance trips, travelling around, tour by private car theme travel, as well as leisure experience based on the Internet and livemediastreaming have become new future trends of tourism consumption. In the meantime, traditional travel service supplies still lag behind new travel modes in light of the insufficient development of facilities and services for leisure and shortdistance travel and holiday arrangements which are not in step with the new changes in tourism consumption. Related departments need to adjust the development outlines of tourism products, routes and newly emerged services, better match supplies and demands and improve structural adjustment and take these issues as the focus of future policies to promote sustainable innovation of tourism consumption.Keywords May Day holidays, tourism consumption, new normal, policy options
