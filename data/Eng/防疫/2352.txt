Chinas grain security is fully guaranteed, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Tang Renjian told a press conference, citing sufficient grain inventories and sound production and sales. Acknowledging the countrys agricultural achievements in withstanding a significant test last year amid the COVID epidemic, Tang called for continuing to enhance grain output and ensure grain security. The ministers remarks came after the release of Chinas No.  central document on Sunday. It lists the targets and tasks concerning agriculture and rural areas for  and a broader vision until . As a rural blueprint unveiled annually, this years document urged retaining a red line of . billion mu  million hectares of arable land and preventing the use of arable land for nonfarming purposes. The country also planned to add  million mu of highstandard farmland with high and stable yields this year. It would be despite droughts and floods, according to the document. China has made massive achievements in the agricultural sector in recent years. Official data showed China had  consecutive years of bumper harvests in grain production, with grain output exceeding  billion kg for six years in a row.

Yet, Chinas grain supply and demand remained in a tight balance, Tang noted, calling for more efforts to enhance grain production to cope with external uncertainties and rising crop demand in the long run. The country in the next stage should not only ensure quantity but also improve the diversity and quality of agricultural products, Tang said. He urged promoting supplyside structural reform in the agricultural sector by improving breeding, branding, and standardized agricultural production to offer a broader range of highquality products to Chinese consumers. Admittedly, China still faces many weak links in germplasm resource protection, and breeding theories and technologies, according to Zhang Taolin, vice agricultural minister. Zhang urged investigations and germplasm resource collection of crops, poultry, and aquatic products. Efforts should also support leading enterprises specializing in germplasm and breeding, facilitate corebreeding technology breakthroughs, and promote agricultural biological breeding projects, Zhang said.
