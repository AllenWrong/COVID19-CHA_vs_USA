You can argue whether those measures are excessive or whether theyre restrictive on people, but theres a lot at stake here, an awful lot at stake, in terms of public health and in terms of not just the public health of China, but people all over the world, Michael Ryan, a WHO leader on health emergencies, said at a news conference on Tuesday in Geneva, Switzerland. Finding the balance between civil liberties and necessary restrictions is sometimes difficult, Ryan said. Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the right one, he said. If you look at whats happening in Wuhan now, the government authorities in China spent a number of weeks pressuring the virus, and you saw the numbers have dropped away, he said. Now they have engaged in doortodoor surveillance and they are going around doing active surveillance. This is a very good public health practice. Ryan added Beijing is a central point in the country where many, many workers return to. So what China is trying to do is, while they are getting success in putting out one fire, they dont want the fire to start somewhere else. Lawrence Gostin, an expert in public health law and professor at Georgetown University in Washington, told time.com recently that quarantines are beneficial While expensive, its more than worth it. It prevents spread of serious illnesses. And its far less costly than having to hospitalize many patients who could contract the coronavirus infection.        Michael J.

Its very easy in retrospect to make judgments on public health decisions made at a certain point, he said. Ryan said the WHO is eager to study the cruiseship transmission to understand what went wrong, so those lessons can be applied to similar efforts in coming days. China announced on Wednesday morning that the number of cases was at ,up , from the day beforeand the death toll stands at ,, an increase of , the authorities said. WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday that the agencys experts are still struggling to understand how fatal and contagious the viral disease is outside China. We dont have enough data on cases outside China to make meaningful conclusions, he said at a news briefing in Geneva, noting that there havent been sustained humantohuman transmissions outside China except for those on the Diamond Princess. The WHO has shipped personal protective equipment and other supplies to  countries so far, and Ghebreyesus said an additional  are to follow. We still have a chance of preventing a broader global crisis, said Tedros. The WHO will continue working night and day with all countries to prepare them. UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday that one of his biggest concerns is the possible spread of the coronavirus to countries with less capacity in their health service. Guterres told The Associated Press in Pakistan that if that were to happen, those countries would require much international help and solidarity. Egypt has reported its first case of the virus, sparking fears that it could spread across Africa, which is particularly illequipped to handle such epidemics.
