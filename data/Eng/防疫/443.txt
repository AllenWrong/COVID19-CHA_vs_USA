A group of Chinese experts arrived in Pakistan on Monday to extend a helping hand to tackle the countrys locust plague, which is threatening the South Asian nations food security.  The experts are inspecting severely hit regions and will donate equipment and offer technical support to help local governments tackle the plague.  At a news conference in Karachi on Wednesday, Chinese experts said chemical pesticides and biotic pesticides remain the best and most effective method for stamping out the massive plague of locusts in large areas of Pakistan, and said the use of ducks had proved inefficient in tackling similar situations in South Asia and East Africa.  Zhang Long, a professor at China Agriculture University and a member of the expert team, said the method of breeding ducks to eat locusts, a traditional Chinese method, can only be applied in certain circumstances in very small areas, and pesticides remain the most efficient way to curb Pakistans locust plague.  Wang Fengle, the teams leader, said the use of ducks is being discussed among some academics but wont be part of the Chinese governments assistance plan.  Previously, Chinese media had reported that , ducks from Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, were likely to join the fight against the ongoing swarms of locusts in Pakistan, which is facing its worst such infestation in  years.  Lu Lizhi, a researcher at the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said the academy was considering cooperation with two Pakistani universitiesSindh Agriculture University and Lasbela University of Agriculture, Water and Marine Scienceson breeding ducks to devour the insects, according to thepaper.cn.  In early February, the Pakistani government declared a national emergency in response to swarms of desert locusts destroying crops in the eastern part of the country.  Lu said he would recommend Guoshao ducks from Shaoxing, which are larger and have an extraordinary capability for hunting, to fight off the locusts in Pakistan. They were used in the fight against locust attacks in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in .  According to Lu, two PhD candidates from Pakistan are planning to travel to Xinjiang after the novel coronavirus epidemic is over and conduct research with Chinese experts.  Lu said preventing and controlling locust attacks in a biological way, including breeding ducks to eat them, could help with ecological restoration after killing the insects.  Locust swarms have already destroyed swaths of farmland in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia in East Africa, threatening food supplies.  According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the invasion of locusts, which started in December, further worsens food security in East Africa, where more than  million people are already experiencing a high degree of food insecurity.  The UN has warned that an imminent second hatch of the insects in East Africa could threaten the food security of  million people across the region.
