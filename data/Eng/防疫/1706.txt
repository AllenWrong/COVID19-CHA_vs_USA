The theme is presented within the context of Chinas highquality economic and social development. GE is demonstrating how it is meeting the countrys market demands in the fields of clean energy, urbanization, accessible healthcare and Internet Plus, and how it is supporting the countrys economic transformation and upgrade. GE is joining the CIIE for the third consecutive year as we believe the event is an important platform to accelerate our collaboration with local partners, said Xiang Weiming, president and CEO of GE China. Given the opportunities and challenges brought about by globalization, it is of great importance for Chinas future development to explore highlevel policy for investment liberalization and facilitation, and to revitalize international investment with an open and cooperative attitude. The CIIE is a beneficial practice for China to promote a more open and inclusive investment environment. As one of the first multinational corporations to enter the Chinese market more than a century ago, GE has this year expanded its exhibition at the CIIE. The company has also set up a pavilion focused on public health and epidemic prevention, displaying its latest solutions. At the expo, GE is confronting the challenges in the countrys drive for clean energy by demonstrating its comprehensive solutions that support multiple energy sources and cover the full value chain from power generation to consumption, especially in the renewable and gas power sectors. As one of the models showcased in China for the first time, Cypress is GE Renewable Energys largestever onshore wind turbine. It features a capacity of . megawatts and a groundbreaking twopiece blade design. It helps drive down the cost of electricity, which is crucial for windfarm economic benefits. The proprietary design will improve logistics to offer more siting options, according to the company. GE is also displaying its most powerful gas turbine, HA, for the first time at the CIIE. The turbine features high flexibility and low emissions and is designed to help operators meet increasingly dynamic power demands. One is installed in Huadians Junliangcheng power plant in Tianjin. The project achieved its first commission in September and is set to support the countrys call for cleaner energy. At the expo, GE is demonstrating the LEAP engine, produced by its CFM joint venture. The LEAP engine comes in three models, of which the LEAPC powers Chinas locally made large aircraft, the C. They aim to meet the demands of mass transport brought about by rapid urbanization. Although the purchasing power of Chinese people is improving as the countrys economy develops, Chinas healthcare system faces the challenges of an aging population, Xiang said. He added that the development of hightechbased healthcare facilities and precision health, which takes into account each individuals healthcare, are set to play a key role in the nations Healthy China  program. Invent the future According to Xiang, the Chinese market, as the secondbiggest market after the United States, is an essential part of the companys global layout. GE cannot achieve its fullspeed development in China without continued efforts from central and local governments to implement measures for openingup and improving the business environment. Our strategy to promote Localization ., strategic partnership and global player is GEs effective practice as a representative of foreign companies to contribute to Chinas economic and social development, Xiang said. To ensure that GE provides local customers with the best products and services, the company said it is committed to localization throughout the value chain, including talent, research and development, manufacturing and procurement. China is also an important part of GEs global supply chain and an innovation base. The results of local RD have been applied to markets and customers beyond China, according to the company. In the field of onshore wind power, GE has developed the . wind turbine, which is designed for the lowand mediumwind environment of China. In the healthcare business, its RD in China aims to create a center of excellence for global value products. It has been equipped with RD capabilities covering nearly all types of medical imaging and diagnostic equipment. Currently, more than  products have been developed as a result of local RD. According to Xiang, the only way to grow GEs business in China is to grow with its customers. Through longterm partnerships with industry leaders, both sides can grow their businesses in local and global markets. In , GE and Harbin Electric set up a joint venture in Qinhuangdao, Hebei province, to accelerate the manufacturing capabilities of heavyduty gas turbines. They joined efforts to accelerate the localization of gas turbines, assist Chinas progress in advanced manufacturing upgrades and brought local customers the most convenient and timely services. In the aviation industry, GE, Air China and local partners set up joint ventures to provide local repair services for engines including CFM and LEAP models. With these sites, fleets of partnered airlines can enjoy convenient and timely support without having to travel to overseas sites. China has become the center of the worlds supply chain network and GEs supply chain in China is playing a significant role in its global business footprint. After years of development and investment, GEs Shenyang plant is the companys only site that is capable of producing all product lines of onshore wind turbines. It is a powerful example of its connectingtheglobe strategy. By the end of July , the factory had supplied nearly , wind turbines to the global market. About onethird of its products are shipped overseas. In March, the Shenyang plant produced the first Asiabuilt Cypress wind turbine to be shipped to Australia. In June, it supplied  sets of . MW turbines for an overseas energy infrastructure project developed by GE and its Chinese EPC partner. GE is a company inventing the future of industry, and we are leveraging our industrial strengths and global resources to deliver success with partners to assist in Chinas highquality development, Xiang said. liyouchinadaily.com.cn ?       ? ?       ? ?
