It has been wonderful being back in school where I can meet my teachers and classmates. It gives me more motivation to learn, she says. Its a pity that we cannot intimately chat with each other after such a long time of separation, but the strict epidemic prevention makes us feel very safe, she adds. Also, my classmates and I cherish this hardearned opportunity to go back to school. After all, our days to attend classes in high school are numbered. Qin is among the , students in their final year of middle or high school in Shanghai who resumed oncampus classes on April  after nearly  days of school closure due to the winter break and the novel coronavirus outbreak.
