Here are some of the most striking images taken from around the world over the past week.        A guard stands at the entrance to the Bronx Zoo on April ,  in New York City. A tiger at the zoo has tested positive for COVID, the Wildlife Conservation Society said in a statement Sunday. The tiger, a yearold named Nadia, had developed a dry cough and a decrease in appetite. Results from a test, which were confirmed by the USDAs National Veterinary Services Laboratory, showed that she had contracted the virus, most likely from a zoo worker.?PhotoAgencies
