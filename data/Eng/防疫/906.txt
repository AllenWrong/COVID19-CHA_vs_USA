In order to build a sound public health emergency management system, it is vital to grasp several key points, including risk anticipation, mass mobilization and coordinated prevention and control efforts. The professionalism of epidemic risk anticipation needs to be highlighted, the advantage of a centralized system and the flexible market mechanism need to be combined, and the comprehensive and professional prevention and control need to draw on each others strengths. We need to take the epidemic event as a leverage, incorporate the public health event management into national emergency management system and accelerate the transformation of the emergency management system according to the requirements proposed at the Fourth Plenary Session of the th CPC Central Committee. To be specific, efforts need to be made in the following five aspects. First, a highly effective and unified command system for emergency response need to be established. Second, the emergency disposal capacities for all kinds of emergency events need to be efficiently coordinated. Third, the emergency material supply system, that could address the daily situation and respond to emergency cases, need to be improved. Fourth, the emergency management needs to be digitalized and bolstered by smart city building.
