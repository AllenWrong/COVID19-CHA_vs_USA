Catering service providers across China need to remain on high alert and carry out COVID epidemic prevention and control measures strictly while resuming business, a national association said in an emergency notice amid the latest outbreak of the coronavirus in Beijing. The notice, released on Sunday by the China Cuisine Association, said catering providers must intensify selfinspection to eliminate food safety risks, covering key foods such as both fresh and frozen meat, poultry and aquatic products and key places including cold storage rooms. Catering enterprises, including restaurants that provide food delivery services, are banned from buying, storing or using food from unknown sources. They should screen foods that are deemed to pose higher risks, such as certain kinds of seafood, to ensure all the materials are traceable, the association said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
