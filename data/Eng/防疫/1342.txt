China Railway No  Engineering Group CREC has drilled through the Ban Konlouang Tunnel, a key bottleneck project of the ChinaLaos railway,  days ahead of schedule. PhotoXinhua    VIENTIANE  China Railway No  Engineering Group CREC told Xinhua on Wednesday that it has drilled through the Ban Konlouang Tunnel, a key bottleneck project of the ChinaLaos railway,  days ahead of schedule. After the completion of the third longest tunnel of the railway, the CREC has bored all its  tunnels, out of the total  of the railway in northern Laos, and has basically finished its offline engineering work. The ,meter Ban Konlouang Tunnel, in the Namor District of Oudomxay Province, some  km north of the Lao capital Vientiane, goes through harsh geological conditions of faults, underground rivers, high temperature, water inrush and mud, which makes its construction a key bottleneck project of the railway. Since the start of the tunnel construction in March , the CREC has strengthened scientific study to develop multiple advanced engineering techniques and methods. With the COVID epidemic setting in, the Chinese engineering company also comprehensively implemented epidemic prevention and control measures during the construction. The ChinaLaos Railway is a strategic docking project between the Chinaproposed Belt and Road Initiative and Laos strategy to convert from a landlocked country to a landlinked hub. The .km railway, with km tunnels and km bridges, will run from Boten border gate in northern Laos, bordering China, to Vientiane with an operating speed of  km per hour. The electrified passenger and cargo railway is built with the full application of Chinese management and technical standards. The project started in December  and is scheduled to be completed and open to traffic in December .
