Global cooperation vital to fight against COVID

The Chinese economy has been severely hit by the novel coronavirus outbreak. And although the Chinese government has taken comprehensive measures to treat the virusinfected patients and contain the epidemic, the spread of the coronavirus to other countries seems to be causing global panic. This is being compounded by there being no known cure for the coronavirus, which has claimed more than , lives in the Chinese mainland. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on Jan , but it did so not because it was dissatisfied with the Chinese governments measures to control the epidemic but to help poorer countries deal with the coronavirus. The declaration will strengthen WHOs disease surveillance on countries with relatively weak healthcare systems, prepare them to deal with the virus and create awareness to contain the epidemic. The coronavirus outbreak has put huge pressure on Beijing, especially because it has occurred at a time when China is close to achieving the goals of its th FiveYear Plan . While the Chinese people pin their hopes on the government containing the epidemic, the international community is closely watching Chinas response to the outbreak. All these have made the task of controlling the outbreak even more difficult for the Chinese authorities. The Chinese government has responded decisively to the outbreak, which marks a departure from its public health policy during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in . The government has also acted swiftly to close all sea food and live animal markets in the country along with imposing travel restrictions on people within the Chinese mainland. The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee has taken note of the Chinese leaderships commitment to investigate and contain the outbreak. It has praised the government for communicating daily updates about the epidemic to the WHO and for adopting a comprehensive multisectoral approach to prevent the further spread of the virus. But given the uncertainty over the virus transmission, stepping up international collaboration is the need of the hour. Although the novel coronavirus was detected in China, it cannot be argued that the onus of finding medical solutions and preventing its spread lies with Beijing alone. Its time the international community supported the countless Chinese medical personnel who have put their own safety at risk to work round the clock to treat the virusinfected patients. An outbreak of such a magnitude often acts as a litmus test for humanity and compassion. Even the most powerful country becomes vulnerable and requires the support and cooperation of the other countries to contain such an outbreak. As such, countries with advanced public healthcare systems should actively chart out strategies of cooperation with the WHO and China to contain the epidemic and find a vaccine for COVID. For instance, such countries could send medical supplies to China to assist the Chinese governments virus control efforts, generate global awareness about the symptoms of the virus, conduct joint research to find a cure for the virus, and prevent the spread of antiChina sentiments abroad. With the rising number of cases in the Republic of Korea and Japan, its clear that no country alone can control an epidemic like COVID. Complicating the situation further is the multiple side effects of the virus. Apart from its potentially deadly pathogenic character, the virus leads to social exclusion and exacerbates the already existing differences on biomedical approaches to epidemic control and global health standards. So collective efforts are needed to end the differences in the battle against the novel coronavirus, control its spread and find a cure for it.
