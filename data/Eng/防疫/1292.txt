Two new types of infrared ray temperature robots recently went onto the market  developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences CAS Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology in Liangjiang New Area, in Southwest Chinas Chongqing municipality, according to area officials.Comparing with traditional intelligent body temperature measuring instruments or systems, the robots can not only measure temperature from a distance, but also with a higher accuracy.In addition, the robots face recognition functions can identify suspect passengers  which can help government departments, schools, hospitals, companies, airports and train stations to prevent and control the novel coronavirus epidemic.Officials said Liangjiangs Huashu Robot Co also developed an infrared ray temperature measuring system with some Wuhan companies.The system adopts optoelectronics, thermal imaging and image processing technologies that can display thermal images and body temperatures in just one second.The system has been applied in Wuhans Leishenshan Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital to provide increased safety and security.Infrared ray temperature measuring has been widely applied in industrial uses, but has seen limited release on the wider market until the virus outbreak.Officials said that to meet the increasing needs for epidemic prevention and control, Liangjiangs companies will increase their RD investment to provide more infrared ray temperaturemeasuring detectors.The CAS Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology can detect the body temperatures of multiple people at the same time.
