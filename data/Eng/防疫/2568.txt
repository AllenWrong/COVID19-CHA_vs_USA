Beijing  to utilize innovative solutions to reduce emissions, increase efficiency                                  China will deliver on its promise of hosting a green, sustainable and intelligent Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Beijing next year, by utilizing impressive hightech innovations, local officials said. New technologies will serve as indispensable support for the  winter sports galas, while the events will also provide scenarios for the application of these new technologies, said Yu Hong, director of the Beijing  organizing committees technology department. For the practical application of these hightech tools, the first thing we focused on were the venues, Yu added. The newly built National Speed Skating Oval, known as the Ice Ribbon, for example, used a saddleshaped cablenet structure in the construction of its lightweight roof, with the amount of steel accounting for only  percent of that used for a traditional roof of its size. The oval will also use a carbon dioxide transcritical direct icemaking technology, controlling the temperature difference of the ice surface within . degrees and bringing carbon emissions down close to zero. It will be the first time for this technology to be applied to the Winter Olympics on such a large scale, according to the organizing committee. Moreover, the waste heat during refrigeration can be further recycled at the oval, enhancing the energy efficiency by  percent. The National Aquatics Center, built for the  Beijing Olympics and later revamped for the  Beijing Winter Olympics, can turn from being the Water Cube into the Ice Cube in  days through the use of a quickdisassembly and a dynamicleveling monitoring system. The Beijing National Stadium, or the Birds Nest, has also evolved into a digital and lowcarbon venue with the help of the internet of things and artificial intelligence technological solutions. During the Winter Olympics, G signals will cover all Games venues and roads connecting them, including the BeijingZhangjiakou HighSpeed Railway. Steady and continuous G signal coverage will be necessary for ultrahigh definition videos and smart services, Yu said. Sustainable development was one of the key concepts put forward by the Beijing government in its bid to host the  Winter Olympics. To honor the promise, Beijing will transfer wind and solar energy from surrounding areas to the three competition zonesdowntown Beijing, its northwest Yanqing district and cohost Zhangjiakou in Hebei provinceto provide a sufficient clean energy supply for all the venues and deliver a carbonneutral Games. We wish all athletes to achieve good results in the hightech venues and will also look forward to applying these technologies to developing better services and experiences for all participants in the Games, Yu said. In the field of epidemic prevention and control, Zhu Jianhong, deputy director of the Beijing Science and Technology Commission, said advanced equipment will be used for largescale health monitoring, environment disinfection and instant responses to help contain the COVID pandemic during the Games. According to the organizing committee of the Games,  new approaches and tech innovations have been used in testing events held in February and April, centering on key scenarios such as venue operation, security, medical services, transportation, weather forecasts and broadcasting. Starting in October, a further  technical achievements are being applied to the training of athletes and related preparations for the Games. haonanchinadaily.com.cn ? ?
