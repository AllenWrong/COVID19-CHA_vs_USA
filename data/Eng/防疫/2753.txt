An installation titled Chinese Xieyi No.  Connoisseurs, a major piece by sculptor Lyu Pinchang, greets visitors upon their arrival at the museum. In it, four bald men, all lifesized cast bronze sculptures, squat around a pile of shattered ancient ceramics that sprawl for meters, as if they were bent on detecting the valuable ones. Lyu and his CAFA colleague, Ma Lu, are holding their exhibitions under the title CAFA Annual Fine Arts Nomination Exhibition .
