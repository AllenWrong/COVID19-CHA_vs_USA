SHI RUIPENGCHINA DAILY    GUANGZHOU  The genome sequence of the novel coronavirus strain separated from pangolins was  percent identical to that from infected people, indicating pangolins may be an intermediate host of the virus, a study has found. The study was led by the South China Agricultural University. According to Liu Yahong, president of the university, the research team analyzed more than , metagenome samples of wild animals and found pangolins as the most likely intermediate host. Molecular biological detection revealed that the positive rate of Betacoronavirus in pangolins was  percent. Researchers further isolated the virus and observed its structure with an electron microscope. They found that the genome sequence of the coronavirus strain was  percent identical to those in infected people. Results showed that pangolins are a potential intermediate host of the novel coronavirus, Liu said, adding that the study will support the prevention and control of the epidemic, as well as offer scientific reference for policies on wild animals.
