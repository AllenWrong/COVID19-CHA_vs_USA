Provincial and citylevel governments should ensure the supply of antiepidemic materials to largescale service outsourcing businesses, and organize catering enterprises to offer mobile canteens and food takeaway services to them, said a circular unveiled by the ministry on Wednesday. To prevent possible infection caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, local governments also should guide service outsourcing companies to adopt flexible working hours to carry out the work. Companies can apply for exportrelated documents via the governments online platforms for qualification review, before the country officially announces the epidemic is ended, the ministry said. Outsourcing is a business practice where a company hires another company to perform tasks. In the past decade, the new wave of technology advancement has generated opportunities for Chinese service outsourcing providers to transform and adapt to the digital era.
