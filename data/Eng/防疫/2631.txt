The fight against infectious diseases is relentless and Wang Quanyi has focused on this fight for  years. Now working as the director of the epidemic and endemic disease control office under the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Wang discovered big data is playing an important role in preventing and controlling the COVID pandemic. Beijing had reported no new locally transmitted COVID cases for  days. But on June , Wang and his team received a new case from Xicheng district at  am. The infected man, , surnamed Tang, reported every place he had visited since May  to Wangs team. From that they set about to locate the source of infection as soon as possible. Tangs activities could be verified through big data analysis because he used his smartphone to pay vendors and chat. Wangs colleague Dou Xiangfeng said Tangs payment records clearly show the stores he went to, which saved a lot of time for onsite research. Tangs description of his visit to the Xinfadi wholesale market in southwestern Beijings Fengtai district on June  proved to be critical for authorities. It helped determine that the market was the source of most of the new local infections. Dou also shared the information with other related departments, which launched big data screening to ensure accuracy. Wang said he was not surprised by the speed the Xinfadi cases were traced because his team is constantly alert to COVID infections. When he first heard of COVID at the end of , Wang and his team started to collect data and determine the methods of laboratory testing and monitoring plans. They stay vigilant. He told the young people in his team You should learn about the history of the pandemic, the latest developments at home and abroad, local risks and how to deal with the situation. Then you can be called a professional. The senior professional started his career at the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control in . When the capital was hit by SARS in , the center could only confirm cases based on epidemiological history and clinical manifestations. This was because the center had no capabilities of laboratory testing. After this, Wang and his colleagues made efforts to build a better prevention and control network. During the HN pandemic in , Beijing established a complete laboratory testing system. It set up  pandemic test laboratories and popularized nucleic acid test techniques in major hospitals. This helped Wang and his colleagues respond quickly when HN bird flu was discovered in  and when Chinas first imported yellow fever case was detected in . In recent years, Wangs team has achieved many internationally influential results in the areas of influenza disease burden, early warning monitoring and vaccine effectiveness evaluation. caoyingyingchinadaily.com.cn ?       ? ?                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
