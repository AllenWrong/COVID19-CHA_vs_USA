JIN DINGCHINA DAILY    On Thursday, the police in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, decided to investigate Okonkwonwoye Chika Patrick, on suspicion he had attacked a nurse at a hospital. According to a news release issued by the police, Patrick was in isolation at the hospital after being diagnosed with the novel coronavirus pneumonia on March . But on Wednesday evening he tried to walk out of his isolation room, pushing to the ground a nurse who tried to stop him, even hitting and biting her. The police arrived soon after, and brought him under control. Guangzhou police have done the right thing by initiating an investigation, proving that anybody, foreigner or local, is equal in the eyes of the law and will be punished if found guilty to deter other potential lawbreakers from committing crimes. If Patrick did indeed walk out of the isolation room, he violated the law on epidemic control and prevention and if he attacked the nurse, he violated the law on public order and possibly even the Criminal Law if the nurse suffered serious injuries. The police have acted quickly, making details of the incident public. The incident happened at  pm on Wednesday five hours later the police had posted details on their official micro blogging site, ruling out the possibility of anyone accusing them of discriminating against a foreigner. Public support is evident in the comments posted on the micro blog.
