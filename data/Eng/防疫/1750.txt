The administration made the statement on its official website on Friday, saying foreigners in China should register their accommodation in time and comply with the identification inspection by public security departments. Foreigners in China should also cooperate with local authorities when they carry out monitoring, isolation and other epidemic prevention measures. If they refuse to declare their health condition or refuse body temperature checks, epidemiological investigations, collection of samples, isolation, onsite diagnosis and hospital referral, they will be held accountable in accordance with the law and will be penalized with a warning, a fine, detention or criminal liabilities. For foreigners who violate the laws and regulations, public security departments will invalidate, cancel or confiscate their visa and other documents, order them to exit China within a time limit, or repatriate or deport them accordingly. Repatriated foreigners will not be allowed to enter China for one to five years and deported foreigners will not be allowed to make their entry within  years from the date of deportation, the administration said. Foreigners in China shall abide by Chinese laws and shall not endanger Chinas national security, harm public interests, and disrupt social and public order, it added.
