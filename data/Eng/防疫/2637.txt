Since the COVID outbreak at the end of , medical services have been crucial in dealing with the novel coronavirus, though some weaknesses have also been revealed during the process medical institutions and healthcare workers specialized in infectious diseases are inadequate infectious disease prevention and treatment is not given enough attention in general hospitals communitylevel medical institutions are not capable of responding to new infectious diseases and the structure design and staff preparedness of most medical institutions are not adaptable to infectious disease prevention and treatment. Thus the following policy options are accordingly proposed.
