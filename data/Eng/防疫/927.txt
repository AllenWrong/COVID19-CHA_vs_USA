China may be the safest place on the planet now. Eight months after its arduous battle against the COVID pandemic, it has largely controlled the highly infectious disease. On Tuesday morning China held a meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to commend the role models in the countrys fight against the COVID epidemic. Now the Chinese mainland has only a handful of imported cases, which were detected at ports of entry thanks to rigorous antipandemic measures including testing, and the infected people were duly quarantined. The governments confidence level is so high that last Thursday Beijing reopened international flights. This is not just some happy talk unrelated to reality, but forged in the crucible of real experience gained during an unprecedented crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
