The Chinese economy posted a continuous recovery in the first nine months and achieved significant results in coordinating development with epidemic prevention, said Liu Aihua, an NBS spokeswoman.

Multiple factors are expected to help sustain the recovery into the fourth quarter, Liu said, such as the recovery of demand, improvement of corporate confidence and profitability, and a more balanced resumption of production. Experts said growth may accelerate to more than  percent yearonyear, close to the prepandemic level of about  percent in the fourth quarter, as consumption further recovers with pentup demand while infrastructure and corporate investments speed up.

However, experts said external uncertainties and the risk of a COVID resurgence domestically remain, and they called on policymakers to maintain the strength of macroeconomic support instead of rushing to roll back the stimuli. The economy is still in the process of recovery, and the foundation for sustained recovery needs to be consolidated, said Liu of the NBS, adding that many economic indicators remain negative. Lu from Nomura Securities said one should not be overoptimistic, given remaining obstacles like the global pandemic situation and tensions between the worlds two biggest economies. Beijing is expected to continue the planned fiscal stimulus and maintain elevated credit growth, though further quick acceleration is unlikely, Lu said. Zhong Nan contributed to this story.
