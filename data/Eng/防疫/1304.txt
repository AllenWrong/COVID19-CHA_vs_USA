Josep Borrell Fontelles, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy noted that countries must strengthen cooperation because its the crucial moment for upholding multilateralism and jointly fighting COVID, and concerted efforts are needed to overcome the common threat of mankind. ? In the era of globalization, countries share challenges and responsibilities. They should realize that to protect the health and security of their own people is a contribution to safeguarding global health security, and helping each other with the COVID control efforts is to relive their own burden. ? Countries should complement each other in the battle against COVID, cooperate vigorously in scientific research, share research data and information, and jointly study and propose coping strategies. Cooperation is an inescapable duty of all countries, and the epidemic tests the sense of responsibility. ? To strengthen communication and coordination is essential. The mounting epidemic prevention pressure makes communication and coordination a pressing task of all countries. ?

Improving global health governance is an initiative that benefits the future generations. Over the past decades, the world has made notable progress in this respect, but also faced complicated and arduous challenges posed by frequent occurring of infectious diseases. In addition, mass population movement in the era of globalization has made health threats more globalized. Also, the weakness of the global health governance system mirrored by the outbreak of the COVID pneumonia has heightened the urgency of improving global public health governance. ? Isolation wont stop the spread of the virus, and no single country is able to meet all challenges on its own. To protect peoples health, countries need to adhere to multilateralism, uphold the principle of wide consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and jointly build a community of common health for mankind. ? Bill Gates, cochair of the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, noted that We need to save lives now while also improving the way we respond to outbreaks in general. To improve the ability to protect mankind against viruses, countries need to be futureoriented and improve global health governance through joint efforts. ? The coronavirus has brought about tough challenges to the human race. To deal with the unknown and huge challenges and mitigate the wideranging influence of the epidemic, mankind needs to work together to beat the virus with faith and bravery. We should believe that as long as countries of the world act to hold the principle of a community with a shared future, and cooperate with each other, well surely dispel the clouds of the virus with cooperation and safeguard peoples right to life. ?
