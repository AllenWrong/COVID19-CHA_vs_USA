Concerted efforts needed to cope with the triple whammy

It goes without saying that the Hong Kong SAR government is fighting an uphill battle on two fronts in the wake of the novel coronavirus onslaught. While struggling to mobilize all members of the community to work in unison to contain the spread of the deadly virus in the city, it is racing against time to come up with relief or support measures to stop the economy from further deteriorating to a point beyond repair. There hasnt been a time when the government needs residents and businesses support and cooperation more desperately than it does now. After imposing mandatory quarantines on all arrivals from the Chinese mainland more than two weeks ago, which has in effect significantly reduced the crossborder personnel flow between the two sides, there have rarely been any reports of imported cases of infection. But the threat of a communitywide spread is looming after several police officers contracted the virus, presumably during a banquet, and several worshippers from a Buddhist temple tested positive for the pathogen. To prevent a disastrous communitywide outbreak from happening, Hong Kong needs the full support and cooperation of every member of the community. For instance, people who are subject to quarantine must strictly comply with all the necessary requirements residents should abandon the harmful not in my backyard mindset they must support the Health Authoritys moves to set up designated clinics and quarantine centers and people should also heed experts advice to avoid social gatherings in such a critical time. Aside from infecting several dozen people and causing two fatalities in the city so far, the novel coronavirus has taken its toll on the local economy, bringing much hardship to businesses as well as to employees. Recognizing the vast economic woes both businesses and individuals face, the SAR government has correctly and swiftly set up a HK billion . billion fund for the relief of small businesses and underprivileged individuals hardesthit by the fallout from the coronavirus epidemic. Under the supervision of a special committee to be set up this week and chaired by a top official, the emergency fund will hopefully provide targeted businesses and individuals with the relief they desperately need in a timely manner by doing away with the usual red tape. But it is definitely not just the governments business to rescue the city from the economic woes caused by the triple whammy of the yearslong SinoUS trade dispute, months of violent riots and the novel coronavirus. Businesses should also remember their social responsibility. They are obliged more than ever to uphold corporate social responsibility, for instance, by doing their best to ensure the stable supply of the products they offer, to refrain from pricegouging practices, and to avoid laying off employees as much as possible. What Hong Kong is battling now is an unprecedented triple whammy. It needs concerted efforts by the government, businesses and residents to overcome these very difficult challenges.                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
