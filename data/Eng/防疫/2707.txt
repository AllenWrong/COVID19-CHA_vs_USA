Elderly people living in the facilities cannot go outside and the facility cannot admit any new elderly people, the bureau said. Facility staff should adopt epidemic prevention and control measure and quarantine for elderly people who need medical treatment outside the facilities, the bureau said. The bureau will determine when to lift the lockdown based on the epidemic situation, it added.
