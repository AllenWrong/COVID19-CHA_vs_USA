Its time to permanently ban wildlife trade

No trading, no killing.This time its not only about the lives of wild animals?but also humans.The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which was first reported in Wuhan and is widely believed to have originated in wild animals, has killed  people as of Saturday and nearly triggered a WHO?global warning in less than three months.We should make every effort to prevent and control the plague. But at the same time, we need to go back to the source of the tragedy and fundamentally break the vicious circle from wildlife to deadly plague.Because preliminary research shows that the chrysanthemum head bat?may be the?most?likely?culprit in Wuhan, which is the same as SARS in . Both of the?viruses?were?transmitted by bat to wild animals and then to human beings.Previously, it was the Institute?of?Virology?of?the?Chinese?Academy?of?Sciences that first revealed in  that the source of the SARS virus was the chrysanthemum head bat. This kind of bat can be found in Southeast China and Southwest China.A researcher from the Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences warned in  that although SARS has not made a comeback for so many years, in nature, viruses similar to SARS still exist. If we humans do not pay attention to such a potential threat, the next viral infection may come and infect humans through other animals. It is just around the corner.In less than one year, her words came true.In fact, the past decade saw an increase in?new infectious diseases around the world?including the bird flu, Ebola and MERS. These new infectious diseases are all related to animals. And research shows that more than  percent of new infectious diseases come from wildlife.The capture, transportation, trade and slaughter of wild animals all may contribute to the occurrence of plague. What should be blamed are wildlife markets, restaurants and gluttonous individuals, but not bats.Stupidity?is doing?the?same?thing?over?and?over?again,?and?expecting different?results.More serious epidemics?will be waiting for us at the next turn?if we cant ban the trade of wild animals permanently and comprehensively.
