The US official who insisted on slandering Chinas efforts in combating the novel coronavirus pandemic is trying to divert attention from Washingtons own domestic contagion situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday. The remarks came after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to persuade the Group of Seven members to include the term Wuhan virus in a joint statement following a videoconference of G foreign ministers on Wednesday. Speaking at a news conference after the meeting, Pompeo also attacked Chinas political system, saying the Communist Party of China poses a substantial threat to our health and way of life, as the Wuhan virus outbreak clearly has demonstrated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
