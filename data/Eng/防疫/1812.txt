By Lin Qiuxiong, General Office, DRCResearch Report, No. ,  Total  Abstract The COVID pandemic is sweeping the world now, which has affected both the most developed and least developed countries and areas and caused damage much greater than SARS. It is the common threat against China and the US, and even the world. History shows that an accidental event caused by a third party often changes the development of ChinaUS relations. Thus, if properly handled, the COVID pandemic could change the course of ChinaUS relations in a positive way. Seizing the opportunity of fighting the novel coronavirus together, China could further consolidate the ChinaUS cooperation foundation, reduce the trade and economic friction, and secure a longer period of favorable external environment, which is to the strategic interests of China. China should show sincerity for cooperation proactively. The two countries top research capacity in the field of biomedicine could be coordinated to make breakthrough in the vaccine research. China need to assume necessary responsibilities in the international community and provide as much epidemic prevention material as possible to those plagued countries. In addition, China should also timely extend international collaboration to the research field of new infectious diseases in the wake of the novel coronavirus breakout. It not only honors Chinas commitment to a shared future for all mankind, but also is conducive to Chinas international image as a responsible power.Keywords COVID, cooperation in fighting the pandemic, ChinaUS relations
