Residents were advised to stay at home, public transportation was reduced, and closed management of residential communities started. The citys epidemic response headquarters issued a notice late on Monday saying visitors from outside the city would receive food, lodging and testing. Information support hotlines were also set up. All of the confirmed and asymptomatic patients in Urumqi were admitted to a hospital in the city that specializes in contagious diseases. Over  healthcare workers are working roundtheclock in the hospital, which has adopted a combined Western and traditional Chinese medicine approach to treatment, Song Yuxia, vicepresident of the hospital, said at the conference. We have begun cooperation with experts from the State Councils Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism, and the diagnosis and treatment method will be optimized under their guidance in the following days, Song said.
