Nie is one of over  psychologists at the Mental Health Service Center at the Beijing Normal University, which set up a hotline for psychological counseling for the public. During initial stages of the outbreak, because of the lockdown, many seeking psychological consultation often said their life was hopeless, said Nie. The spread of information online has increased public concerns in the last few days. When will the epidemic end and Do I have COVID were some of the common questions asked by callers in the early days. Many felt they had novel coronavirus pneumonia, and they were afraid they would fall sick. In recent days, the rush to seek help has greatly reduced as the people have overcome concerns through phone counseling, Nie said. The counseling takes about  minutes per session, said the consultant. The psychological consultation team of the Beijing Normal University, which works in four shiftsfrom  am to  midnightwas divided into four groups to answer peoples queries.
