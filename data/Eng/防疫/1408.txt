Series of aid consignments received from China                                             Editors Note Nations are collaborating in the fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak to limit the damage to peoples health and the impact on the global economy. Here, in the seventh part of a series titled One World, One Fight, we look at how countries can work together. After a brief nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of COVID, most Iranians, including those in the capital Teheran, are now allowed to leave their homes for shopping and work. Lowrisk businesses, including many shops and factories, have resumed operations. Shopping malls and bazaars have reopened, along with parks, gardens and recreational areas, which people can visit as long as social distancing is observed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
