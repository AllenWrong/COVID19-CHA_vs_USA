The Tazi Lake community in Wuhans Jiangan district has provided doortodoor service for more than  households in difficulty, according to community Party chief Wang Xiaoqi. Control and prevention work in the community faces more pressure as some cadres and employees of enterprises return to their own positions amid gradual work resumption. More Party members, department leaders and volunteers will be mobilized to help people in need, Wang said. We have set up a WeChat group consisting of pharmacy workers, family doctors at the medical center, and community staff to share information and ensure residents get needed medicine, he added.
