All people coming to Chongqing from overseas are subject to temperature screening and nucleic acid testing starting Tuesday, according to the citys leading group for epidemic prevention and control. Those with abnormal results will be sent directly to designated hospitals. People who have normal results but are from countries with severe epidemic situations will be quarantined at designated places for  days at their own expense while the rest are subject to a day home quarantine. People are asked to pay their own testing and treatment bills if they are not covered by either the countrys medical insurance or commercial ones. There will be assistance for people who experience financial difficulties, said the leading group. Those who conceal their travel and health information and lead to infection or bring huge infection risks will be punished according to the law, it said. In recent days, China has reported an increasing number of imported coronavirus cases as the virus spread further in the world, prompting major cities or provinces, including Beijing and Shanghai, to tighten quarantine rules for travelers from abroad.
