Companies resumed production with epidemic prevention measures during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. PhotoXinhua    Feng Xiuquan, a migrant worker from Guangyuan in Southwest Chinas Sichuan province, was almost tearing his hair out over the trip back to his workplace in Hangzhou, East Chinas Zhejiang province since the novel coronavirus flared.Staying at home for two more weeks than planned after the Spring Festival, the yearold was craving an injection of cash. However, the ongoing epidemic barred him from returning to the clothing factory he works at due to his fear of getting infected during the return trip, along with blocked transportation channels. The loss of weeks of income is not a small thing to me and my family, he said. But I cant bear the consequences of staying in hospitals for a rather longer time if I get infected during my trip back to work. His worry vanished when a local authority arranged a chartered flight free of charge to help him and another  migrant workers return to their workplaces while making sure they do not catch any infection during the trip. Migrant workers are among Chinas most vulnerable, and much of Chinas manufacturing industry depends on them. If they cant get back to their jobs soon, both they and the companies they work for will suffer, said Chen Pu, an economics professor at Renmin University. The measure will curb the transmission of the virus that might spread during the travel season and guarantee the safety of both migrant workers and their workplaces, as well meet labor demands of enterprises as they resume production, he added.According to the Ministry of Transport, an estimated  million migrant workers are going to travel back to their workplaces,  million of whom have already returned. Some  million workers are expected to make the trip from now until the end of February, with another  million expected to return next month.To meet the employment demands of enterprises and reduce the risks of the epidemic spreading, transportation authorities across the country have been going allout to provide charter services using various transportation means in a bid to help a large number of migrant workers return safely and smoothly to workplaces.In Guiyang, capital of Southwest Chinas Guizhou province, a local railway operator has also stepped up efforts to arrange a customized train on Sunday, carrying nearly  migrant workers who are returning to work in Hangzhou.The move came after Hangzhou had applied to the local railway operator for a chartered train service for those returning to work from places where the epidemic situation is relatively stable and the number of employees coming to Hangzhou is high, according to China Railway Chengdu Group.Special measures have been arranged for passengers on the train, including strict temperature monitoring, better ventilation and scattered seating.More pointtopoint direct trains for returning migrant workers will be opened to help workers from Southwest Chinas Sichuan, Chongqing and Guizhou return to areas, including Beijing, Shanghai and South Chinas Guangzhou, after the Spring Festival, the company said.Transport departments at all levels also have ramped up chartered bus support to provide safe transportation for migrant workers in an effort to meet the labor demand for enterprises as they resumed production.To reduce the crossinfection risk of the novel coronavirus, the ministry made it specific that the number of passengers on interprovincial and intercity chartered buses should be less than half of their approved passenger capacity.Other measures outlined include a tollfree policy for chartered buses, and strengthened epidemic prevention and control measures, as well as improved services for passengers and drivers at interchange stations.As of Friday, transport authorities have organized chartered buses for pointtopoint transportation and brought , rural workers back to cities for work.
