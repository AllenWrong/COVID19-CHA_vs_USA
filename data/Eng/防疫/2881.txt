The Civil Aviation Administration of China, along with multiple departments including the National Health Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will introduce a reward and circuit breaker mechanism for airlines based on passenger nucleic acid test results upon arrival in order to contain the number of imported cases of COVID. As an incentive, carriers will be allowed to increase the number of international flights to two per week on one route if the number of passengers who have a positive nucleic acid test on their flights stands at zero for three consecutive weeks, according to the administration. The airline must suspend the operation of the route for one week if the number of passengers who test positive for the coronavirus reaches five. If the number exceeds , the airline will suspend the flights for four weeks, it said. add  international flightsthe average number of daily inbound passengers  domestic carriers can fly just one flight a week on one route to any countryoperate only one inbound route Overseas airlines that currently cannot operate flights to China will be permitted onceperweek flights into one of  port cities of their choosing starting on Monday.  ChinaSingapore fast lane Starting Monday, people from Singapore and six Chinese municipalities and provinces can make essential business or official trips without having to go through the required day quarantine period.   ChinaSingapore fast lanebusiness and official travelersapplications submitted by the companies or government departments to receive them in the destination countrytheir whole stay in the destination country will be effectively managed, forming a closed loop to ensure safety The first phase of the ChinaSingapore fast lane will be implemented between Singapore and six Chinese provinces municipalities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong. The two sides will gradually expand the implementation scope and discuss the gradual resumption of commercial flights between the two countries, depending on the circumstances.  The fast track arrangement between China and the ROK was applicable to ten Chinese provinces and cities at the beginning. ROK travelers can apply for visa after applications submitted by their companies are approved. After passing through healthscreening and quarantine procedures, they will be quarantined for a shorter period of time in China, and their whole stay in China will be effectively managed, forming a closed loop to ensure safety. Chinese travelers to the ROK who wish to use the fast track need to apply for exemption from quarantine when applying for visa from the ROK embassy or consulates in China. If they meet the conditions for approval of the ROK side and test negative for the coronavirus before departing for and after arriving in the ROK, they will be exempted from quarantine and accept flexible epidemic prevention management of the ROK side.  At present, the fast lane between China and the ROK has been implemented smoothly and yielding good results. The implementation of the fast lane between China and Singapore is on the way, and I believe it will achieve the desired goals. We are also ready to continue to explore similar arrangements with other countries. While doing a good job in epidemic prevention and control, we are also committed to resuming necessary peopletopeople exchanges, providing support for the resumption of work and production as well as deeper cooperation in both countries, and contributing to the economic and social recovery and development of the region and the world at large.
