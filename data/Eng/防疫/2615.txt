CHINA DAILY    It was during the Spring Festival holiday when Fujian resident Chen Xiarong had to leave for Wuhan, Hubei province, to provide medical assistance at the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Chen is a nurse at the No  Hospital affiliated to Fujian Medical University, and also a mother of a yearold girl. Waiting for the outbound bus, Chen was hugged tightly by her daughter, whose eyes were welling up. The farewell moment was captured by a local newspaper and then the photo was circulated online, touching millions across the country. Among them was Wu Shengwen, mother of a yearold daughter. My Mommy The Virus Warrior, a picture book authored by Wu and her team, is a heartwarming letter to the thousands of children whose medical professional parents are in Hubei, supporting the fight against the epidemic.
