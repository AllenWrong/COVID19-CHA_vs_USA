Overall, the COVID response in China has been conducted soundly, said spokesman Mi Feng at a press conference of the State Council interagency task force for COVID response. However, more accurate and effective epidemic prevention and control measures are still needed to ensure that there are no largescale rebounds in cases. Chinas annual vaccine production can fully meet the whole countrys needs, as judged by the existing production arrangements, said Mao Junfeng, an official from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, at the same press conference. China has authorized five COVID vaccines for conditional marketing or emergency use. These include three inactivated vaccines, one adenovirus vector vaccine, and one recombinant protein subunit vaccine, Mao noted.
