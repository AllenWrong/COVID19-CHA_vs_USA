Strict epidemic prevention and control measures should apply to more groups, including putting close contacts of confirmed patientsclose contacts under isolation, with each one in a separate room at designated isolation sites, he said. Meanwhile, more precise and effective epidemic control and prevention measures should be applied to residential compounds. Residents living in medium or high risk areas should not leave the city, while residents living in lowrisk areas can leave with certificates to prove they have tested negative for the novel coronavirus, Ma said. Ma also ordered authorities in Dalian to try every means to save patients, including emptying a hospital within  hours to exclusively receive COVID patients, to ensure all COVID cases in the city can get admitted.
