Africa Star Railway Operation Company, a subsidiary of China Road and Bridge Corporation and which is responsible for operations of Kenyas Standard Gauge Railway passenger and freight services, has not only observed the imposed measures to curb spread of the disease but has also ensured efficient transportation of the needed medical supplies. Aside from transporting the normal cargo, the company increased the transportation of bulk grain, epidemic prevention materials and other life necessities. Some  twentyfoot equivalent units or TEUs of epidemic prevention materials and  TEUs of bulk grain were transported through the Standard Gauge Railway, contributing greatly to the economic development and epidemic prevention in Kenya. Olivia Mengich, the spokesperson of the Africa Star Railway Operation Company, said since the coronavirus outbreak, they have strictly complied with and responded to the national curfew policy and the cessation of movement directives for several counties. Each cargo train is equipped with an additional coach for isolation and antiepidemic materials such as hand sanitizers, gunthermometers, protective gloves, masks, protective clothing and goggles among others, Mengich said. She said once a passenger has fever or suspected to be infected, they guide them to the isolation coach, and cooperate with the ministry of health. The company strives to achieve the goal of zero infection by distributing protective equipment to employees, organizing training, and disinfecting living quarters and work places, Mengich said. She said they have overcome various difficulties such as fewer personnel, greater epidemic prevention pressure and threat of confirmed cases by the cooperating partners, in order to comply with the governments directives and meet the requirements of the cargo owners. Adhering to the principle of guaranteeing transportation efficiency and quality, we adopted many measures, including adjusting personnel organization and changing shift system, Mengich said. They also increased workloads of all the on duty staff, sending managerial staff to work on the front line and organizing overtime inspection and maintenance of equipment, to ensure the successful epidemic prevention, transportation and production safety, thus achieving a good social impact and economic benefits.
