PhotoAgencies    If always looking at something through a prism of traditional bias, one can hardly see it in an objective manner. That is the problem a lot of Western media have with how they look at things relating to China. What they have said about Chinas COVID vaccines is an example of how they cannot stop looking through their prisms of prejudice. China proclaimed that its vaccines would be a global public good and it has been good to its word providing many countries, developing ones in particular, with its vaccines in different ways. Yet Western media outlets describe that as vaccine diplomacy, meant to increase Chinas global influence. Then, with Chinas vaccines being welcomed by an increasing number of countries, they started to question the safety and efficacy of Chinas vaccines. When a Chinese virologist talked about how to increase the protection rate of Chinas vaccines recently, what he said was misinterpreted by Western media outlets to cast doubt over the efficacy of Chinas four approved vaccines. But the facts speak for themselves. Sinopharms Vero vaccine, for example, achieved  percent efficacy in a Phase III study conducted in  countries. In a separate study, the United Arab Emirates achieved  percent efficacy. The efficacy of Sinovacs CoronaVac vaccine ranges from  percent, according to preliminary studies from Brazil and Indonesia, which have received a lot of vaccines from China. In principle, the efficacy values improve even further to over  percent when severe courses of disease are taken into account, namely those that also require hospitalization. It is difficult to test the efficacy of the vaccines in China because very few cases of infection have occurred since the country generally controlled the epidemic last year, thanks to its effective control and prevention measures. Research is therefore dependent on studies conducted in heavily affected countries such as Brazil. The efficacy rate of Chinas vaccines may not be as high as those seen in the mRNA vaccines from BioNTechPfizer or Moderna, which the companies claim have over  percent efficacy, they are still significantly more effective than some influenza vaccines, some of which only achieve efficacy levels of  percent. In addition, Chinas vaccines have proved to be very safe. There have been no serious adverse reactions reported as there have been for some other vaccines. Western media therefore have no reason to question the efficacy of Chinas vaccines when China has already provided more than  countries and international organizations with vaccines. Neither can they underestimate the contributions Chinas vaccines have made to the fight against COVID. What the world needs is solidarity rather than the smearing of vaccines or the efforts of a particular country.
