The group said that all people who need to be tested should have access to the test and their results should be included in the local health condition monitoring app. It also ordered districts to strictly screen people who come to Beijing on shortterm business trips. Rented rooms should be strictly checked to avoid risk of infection. At the same time, authorities announced that delivery drivers, domestic workers and property agents may enter communities gradually. In recent months, all communities in Beijing have been closed to nonresidents, and delivery drivers normally wait outside for residents to come for their packages.
