The th Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference National Committee, the countrys top political advisory body, concluded its postponed and greatly shortened annual session on Wednesday. Usually, the CPPCC National Committees annual session lasts around  days, but this year, with impressive efficiency, the national political advisory body drastically condensed its agenda and completed its work in seven days. Despite the disruption caused by the COVID pandemic, and rigid socialdistancing rules, the vigorous CPPCC discourse has maintained its focus on vital issues of most concern to the people. But judging from what has been heard from their meetings, the representatives have been as dedicated as usual in fulfilling their advisory roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
