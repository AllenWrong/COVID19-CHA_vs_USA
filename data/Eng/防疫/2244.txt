The capital has enhanced coordination among municipal departments, including customs and airports, as well as public security agencies, to register travelers identities and strengthen health exams at ports of entry. The Beijing Center for Diseases Prevention and Control has urged all overseas Chinese to avoid traveling, but to conduct any necessary international travel in strict accordance with the relevant recommendations and requirements of local authorities and Chinese embassies.

According to the seventh edition of COVID diagnosis and treatment guidelines, issued on Wednesday by the National Health Commission, cases of infection abroad are on the upswing, but the domestic epidemic situation in most of China has been relieved. Care should be given to guarding against possible transmission and spread of imported cases from outside China, the guidelines said. Zhang Yangfei and Wang Qingyun contributed to this story.
