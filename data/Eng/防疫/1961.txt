Previously, only local regulations in some provincial regions required dog owners to keep their pets on a leash in public areas. Chinese lawmakers adopted the revision in January in a bid to prevent dogs from hurting people, as well as to reduce transmission of infectious diseases. Dogs should also wear a dog tag, be inoculated against rabies and registered with local authorities, according to the law. Many people have voiced support for the new provisions via social networks.
