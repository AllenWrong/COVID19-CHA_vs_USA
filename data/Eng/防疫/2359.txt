The demand was made at a meeting of the leading group of Chinas COVID epidemic response, which was chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. Noting the rapid spread of the pandemic overseas and the rising risk of imported cases through land border, the meeting urged local authorities to hold the defense line of communities, ports and borders. China will support the border regions to step up their lab test and medical treatment capabilities while toughening port management, quarantine inspections and traffic controls in border areas. Stricter epidemic control measures will be imposed in economic cooperation centers and trade markets along the border. Efforts will be made to ensure smooth international freight transport on the premise of safety.
