By Qiu Yue, Ma Luyan  Cheng Zhaowen, China Development Research FoundationResearch Report, No.,  Total  Abstract The digital technology has played a major role in Chinas COVID prevention and control, showing its broad prospects in the health sector. Taking into account questionnaires and interviews of  leading digital health enterprises that participated in the epidemic prevention and control, as well as public opinions on Sina Weibo about the application of digital technology, the research found that the epidemic prevention and control reflects the quick response ability of digital health technology. The technology brings development opportunities such as public recognition and policy support, but it still faces huge difficulties in policy landing, data sharing, financing, pricing and payment as well as registration and reviewing. In response to the above challenges, this paper proposes the following policy options. First, we need to find the elements that are out of step with the policy, so that the industry can truly enjoy policy dividends. Second, we need to promote the new type of infrastructure for digital health with the goal of connectivity and sharing so as to lay the foundation for the application of digital technology. Third, we need to explore ways to build a multitiered financing and payment system to help industries develop sustainable business models. Fourth, we need to optimize the approving rules related to payment so as to improve the speed of approval.Keywords epidemic prevention and control, digital technology, health services
