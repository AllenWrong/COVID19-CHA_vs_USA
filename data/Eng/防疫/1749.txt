Located in Minhang district, the team was established on Feb  by the Jinfeng International Community Development Association, which aims to promote the development of Huacao town and the Jinfeng International Community by organizing themed activities and public welfare events. Pakistani Amir Shafiq Khan joined the team to give back. Its easy to run away to another country, but I felt that my family and I should contribute to China in this difficult time as it has always offered opportunities to us, says Khan, who has lived in China since . I want to help the community with my experience and understanding of both foreigners needs and Chinese culture. One of the first things that Khan did was to provide vital information to the foreigners in his community as well as correct misunderstandings or falsehoods being spread online about the epidemic.
