Photo by Wang Chengmengchinadaily.com.cn    On Thursday, at a news conference on the epidemic prevention and control work in Beijing, it was announced that Xinfadi Market will reopen. However, it will now be wholesale only. Two months have passed since the market was shut down in early June because of a cluster of novel coronavirus cases that originated there. During the two months, Xinfadi has been closed, it has been sterilized, and all workers at the market and recent visitors have been tested. These efforts must be cherished and measures must be taken to ensure the safety of the market. The terminating of its retail operations is one of the necessary measures to ensure the markets safety. As one of the largest food markets in Asia, Xinfadi previously had tens of thousands of customers coming every day to buy meat, seafood, vegetables and even eggs. Xinfadi was therefore usually crowded. Moreover, many of the buyers come from various corners of Beijing, even nearby cities, while the products on sale come from all over the world. Now the market will only serve registered wholesale buyers, including those from hotels and restaurants. In that way, the number of visitors will be effectively reduced. That will enable the market to better enforce prevention and control measures. Some said it might be inconvenient for local residents who used to shop at the market. That concern has already been taken into consideration. Outside the market, a new market for retail that covers , square meters has been established, plus  convenience stores and  vans will sell vegetables to residential communities. In this way, the agricultural products from Xinfadi can still be bought by local residents without any middle dealer. The only difference is they now buy the vegetables and meat in separate spaces, which is much safer.
