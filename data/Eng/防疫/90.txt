He said France is sincerely grateful for Chinas valuable support and help, and is willing to make concerted efforts with China to boost bilateral health cooperation and encourage all relevant parties to promote cooperation within such frameworks as the G and the World Health Organization.  During the phone talks, Johnson said he congratulated the Chinese government and people on the remarkable achievements they have made in epidemic prevention and control with strenuous efforts and enormous sacrifices.  He said Britain has been studying and learning from Chinas useful experience and will do its best to take care of the health and safety of Chinese nationals in Britain, especially students.  The British prime minister said he fully agrees with Xi that no country can wall itself off from the epidemic, and all countries should strengthen cooperation.  He added that he looks forward to maintaining close contact with Xi and visiting China at an early date after the epidemic, in order to jointly promote the development of bilateral relations.  When talking with Xi over the phone, Bolsonaro expressed appreciation that China facilitated Brazils purchase of medical resources, saying he salutes the Chinese people.  Saudi Arabia, the chair of this years summit, said earlier that leaders from the G economies, including China, France, the United Kingdom and Brazil, are set to convene a virtual summit this week to address the novel coronavirus pandemic.  Wang Huiyao, the president of the Center for China and Globalization, said the virtual G summit would be an important platform for experience sharing and coordinating global efforts to fight the pandemic while coming up with plans for global economic revitalization.  While talking with his Egyptian counterpart on Monday night, Xi reiterated Chinas advocacy of boosting global cooperation in fighting the pandemic based on the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind.
