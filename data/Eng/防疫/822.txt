Reports by top procuratorate and top court highlight impact on governance        PhotoVCG    Judicial authorities handled more public interest litigation cases last year, strengthening supervision of administrative departments and promoting lawbased social governance, the annual work reports of the top procuratorate and top court showed. The reports were submitted to the annual session of Chinas top legislature for deliberation on March  and passed by legislators on March . Public interest litigation is an important institutional arrangement to promote the modernization of Chinas governance system, said Ma Qi, deputy head of the Supreme Peoples Procuratorates general office. It has played a significant role in safeguarding national and public interests since it was implemented nationwide in July , he said. Procuratorates initiate the vast majority of such civil cases. Last year, procuratorates at all levels handled , public interest litigation cases, with the number of cases against nongovernment entities doubling and the number of cases against administrative departments up . percent yearonyear. The number of public interest litigation cases initiated by procuratorial organs was up . percent, the report said. Ma said the increase in the number of cases initiated by procuratorates does not mean that government departments have more problems, but that stricter supervision requirements have been adopted. Administrative public interest litigation involves supervising administrative departments performance of their duties, and some procuratorates had been afraid and unwilling to handle such cases at first, Ma said. The top procuratorate then made it clear that while procuratorial and administrative organs have different divisions of labor, they share the same objectives. The work has now won strong support from administrative organs, he said. In administrative public interest litigation, procuratorates first consult with administrative departments about problems, asking them to perform their duties and solve problems. If the consultation fails, procuratorates will send official suggestions urging the department to rectify the problem. Departments that fail to rectify them within the allotted time are sued. The essence of public interest litigation is to facilitate administrative organs performance of their duties according to law and jointly safeguard the fundamental interests of the people, Ma said. The system aims to solve problems. As long as the problem is solved, the ongoing procedure will stop. Taking the case of some polluting companies enjoying preferential tax policies as an example, the Supreme Peoples Procuratorate worked with the State Administration of Taxation to verify the cases and urged the administration to make rectifications and promote information sharing on environmental penalties to improve the tax policies by closing such loopholes. Last year, procuratorates nationwide issued , preprosecution procuratorial suggestions, up . percent yearonyear. About . percent of the administrative organs involved replied and rectified the problems, the report said. They also filed , lawsuits against departments that failed to implement procuratorial suggestions, and the courts had concluded , such cases, it said. According to the Civil Procedure Law and the Administrative Procedure Law, procuratorates can handle public interest litigation in the areas of environmental and resources protection, food and drug safety, Stateowned property protection, the transfer of Stateowned landuse rights, and the rights and interests of heroes and martyrs. However, some areas of public interest, such as production safety, public health and the protection of people with disabilities, have not yet been covered by such laws. Many legislators and political advisers want to expand the scope of public interest litigation, Ma said. Procuratorates filed , cases last year related to common problems in a number of areas, including epidemic prevention materials, the treatment of medical waste and railway safety. When delivering the report to the fourth session of the th National Peoples Congress in Beijing this month, ProcuratorGeneral Zhang Jun said procuratorial work should be actively integrated into the overall development situation and assist in the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects. Zhang said public interest litigation should highlight the warmth and strength of the rule of law, reduce the cost of safeguarding peoples legitimate rights and interests and raise the cost of breaking the law. Prosecutors initiated public interest litigation on the construction of a barrierfree environment for the disabled and eliminating the digital divide for seniors unable to use the smartphone health codes rolled out as an epidemic prevention measure and payment codes to make everyday purchases. Procuratorates also handled , food and drug safety public interest litigation cases and  militaryrelated ones, the report said. About , suspects were prosecuted for damaging the environment and resources last year, a yearonyear increase . percent, and prosecutors also handled , public interest litigation cases in those areas, up  percent yearonyear. A case involving the cleaning up of Wanfeng Lake, which was directly handled by the top procuratorate, concluded last year. The lake used to have bad water quality due to poorly regulated farming and central environmental inspection teams urged cleanup efforts in  and . The square kilometer lake lies at the junction of Guizhou and Yunnan provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, and its pollution management and prevention responsibilities fell under different departments in those jurisdictions, leading to inefficient rectification. The Supreme Peoples Procuratorate filed the case and issued suggestions urging related authorities to rectify the problems in December . When the case was concluded last year, about . sq km of the lakes area had been cleaned up, with  metric tons of garbage removed. The top procuratorate, the ministries of public security, ecology and environment, and natural resources work together to target hazardous waste that damages the environment, and have strengthened law enforcement cooperation to protect farmland. Last year, Chinese courts intensified their efforts in handling public interest litigation to strengthen environmental protection and ecological conservation, according to the annual work report of the Supreme Peoples Court, which was also delivered to this months NPC meeting. It showed that courts nationwide concluded , public interest cases concerning the environment last year, up . percent yearonyear. Meanwhile, courts at all levels also paid close attention to hearing public interest litigation related to the purchase of houses, cars, tourism services and online education to create a sound legal environment for the countrys consumption upgrade.
