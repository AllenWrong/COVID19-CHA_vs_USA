Jin DingChina Daily    China will step up efforts to enhance supervision to prevent the shipment and sale of wild animals as preventive and control measures to curb the spreading of the novel coronavirus, according to the State Administration for Market Regulation. Wild animals likely to carry the novel coronavirus are banned from shipment and sale. All local authorities should increase inspections to enforce strong measures against wildlife markets and severely investigate and punish violators, Gan Lin, deputy chief of the administration, said on Sunday. The administration, together with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, recently issued a joint statement banning the trade of wild animals. The ban will continue until the epidemic situation is lifted nationwide. The administration will also enhance inspections on marketplaces, supermarkets and dining places, as well as strengthen monitoring and supervision of ecommerce sites, she said, adding it will work closely with public security departments to crack down on the wild animal trade.
