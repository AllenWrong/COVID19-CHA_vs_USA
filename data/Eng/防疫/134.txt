PhotoAgencies    If you look at whats happening in Wuhan now, the government authorities in China spent a number of weeks pressuring the virus, and you saw the numbers have dropped away. Now they have engaged in doortodoor surveillance and they are going around doing active surveillance. This is a very good public health practice. Michael Ryan,?executive director of the?WHO?Health?Emergencies Programme We did appreciate the speed with which the new coronavirus was identified by Chinese investigators and the unprecedented containment effort which is being conducted. Franco Servadei, president of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Its pretty much unprecedented. No one has attempted something like this in history to my knowledge. In many countries it would be impossible to even try. Arthur Reingold, epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley While expensive, its more than worth it. It prevents spread of serious illnesses. And its far less costly than having to hospitalize many patients who could contract the coronavirus infection.

I am very pleased that the WHO is praising china as well for its huge efforts. We will benefit from that. All the rest of the world will benefit from that. John Sydney Oxford, virologist and professor of Queen Mary, University of London As of now, quarantine isolation is the main measure for preventing the spread of the virus. The Chinese government has shut down local passenger transportation in the affected regions.
