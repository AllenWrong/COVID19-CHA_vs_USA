JIN DINGCHINA DAILY    On Sunday evening, the police in Beijing registered a case against a woman who tested positive for the novel coronavirus after returning from a trip to Thailand. The woman did not report her trip to the local authorities, resulting in many other people, who she had met, being put under medical observation. This is not the first case of its kind. Last week alone, two similar cases were reported in Qingtian, Zhejiang province, where two people hid the fact that they had traveled to Europe until they were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus. They were given medical care and then slapped with legal cases, but it did not stop a third similar violation from taking place. The negative outcome of hiding ones coronavirusrelated health condition has been made amply clear That it might delay treatment not only for the person concerned but also threaten public heath safety, as those staying with the patient or coming into contact with himher could also become infected. Thats why those who hide their heath conditions upon entering China must bear the legal consequences. On Monday, the Supreme Peoples Court, the Supreme Peoples Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security and two other departments jointly issued a notice saying those who falsely report their heath information upon entering China could face criminal charges. Thats in accordance with the criminal code and the Law on Prevention of Epidemics, which applies equally to both Chinese natives and foreigners. It is hoped that starting an investigation against the three abovementioned violators will serve as a warning for all those who enter China in the future. One must care not only for ones own life, but also the lives of others.
