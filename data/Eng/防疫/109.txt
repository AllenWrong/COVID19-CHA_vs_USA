The government of Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, said in a notice that the citys residential communities will continue closedoff management, and residents passing through communities entries must have their temperatures checked and wear a mask. The notice warned against slackening vigilance amid the increased flow of people and influx of nonlocals. Preventing a rebound in the outbreak remained an arduous task, it said, citing the emergence of asymptomatic patients, patients who test positive again after being discharged from hospitals and new cases in people arriving from abroad. Hubei Province reported only one new confirmed case of COVID in the past week, but on Thursday,  new asymptomatic patients were registered there, up from  on Wednesday.
