On Tuesday, he received an unexpected letter from his father. Wang Zhichun, his yearold father, has suffered from hearing deterioration and has a hard time talking via phone, so he wrote the letter to encourage his son to continue working hard to enhance the protection of  local families from the virus. He has not seen his son since Jan , when Tianjin adopted its top response under the fourlevel major public health emergency response system. The son was on hour duty advocating prevention measures to each family. The father wrote You should be responsible for our whole village. Dont be negligent about any possibilities, and prevent any emergency and sickness, the father wrote. Please close our village if some severe syndrome appears. Your duties are highly important. Surviving this period will be auspicious for all our villagers.. Wang was among the numerous village heads working to protect local villagers  hours a day in Tianjin. They have halted all celebrations and family visits to their villages and broadcasted preventive measures, including using face masks.
