Increased testing cleared people, bringing down number of cases, health experts say                    The number of new suspected cases nationwide of the novel coronavirus has dropped for two consecutive days, and fell to under , on Tuesday, new figures show. Increased testing that either cleared suspected people of contracting the virus or confirmed diagnoses has resulted in the slower growth rate, health experts said. However, two newborns, one just  hours old, were confirmed to have the virus on Wednesday in Wuhan, capital of Hubei provinceepicenter of the outbreaksuggesting possible mothertofetus infections. The National Health Commission reported , new suspected cases on the Chinese mainland on Tuesday, compared with , on Monday and , on Sunday. The total number of suspected cases across the country stood at , as of the end of Tuesday. Hubei, which draws assistance from other regions, saw the number of new suspected cases also decrease by , on Tuesday, the commission said. Improved testing capability has allowed infected patients to receive better and more timely treatment, and people who are ruled out are able to return to normal lives, Song Shuli, the commissions spokeswoman, said on Wednesday. Such an encouraging sign has been observed in Hubei as well as the entire country, Song added. She was speaking at a news conference held by the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council, an intergovernmental system that consolidates disease prevention efforts from different government bodies. Li Xingwang, head of Beijing Ditan Hospitals infectious disease center, said the number of confirmed cases has expanded as people suspected of having the virus can now access diagnostic kits more quickly. Testing for the virus in Hubei has accelerated rapidly, he said.The numbers computethe reduction in suspected cases is accompanied by an increase in confirmed cases as well as those in severe condition. The number of confirmed cases on the mainland rose by , on Tuesday to ,, according to the National Health Commission. The mainland death toll went up by  to  as of late Tuesday night. Although concerted nationwide efforts have appeared to ease the crisis in Hubei, it is still premature to predict the outbreaks future development, experts have said. The two confirmed infections of newborns at Wuhan Childrens Hospital has caused experts to worry about the possibility of mothertofetus infection. Both babies are in stable condition, the hospital said. Wang Chen, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, told Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday that the spread of the novel coronavirus is still severe and unclear, and should never be underestimated. We dont have evidence to predict when the epidemic will reach its peak or turning point. The most urgent task at hand is to halt the diseases spread and to swiftly identify and gather mild cases into designated quarantine facilities to prevent wider transmission,Wang said. To serve this end, Wuhan is under intense pressure to handle a ballooning number of patients. The city has been working round the clock to set up  temporary hospitals by refitting warehouses, convention centers, gymnasiums and schools. These temporary institutions can together provide more than , hospital beds for patients with mild symptoms, Xinhua said. Wang Ying, a supervisor of a temporary hospital set up in a gymnasium, told Beijing News that they have divided the facility into grids and passages and require the beds to be situated . meters apart in an attempt to reduce the risk of crossinfection.But the risk is very low, as all patients admitted into these hospitals are mild infection cases,Wang said. The National Health Commission has released an updated version of diagnosis and treatment guidelines on Wednesday, highlighting more rigorous screening and quarantine measures to control spread of the contagion.
