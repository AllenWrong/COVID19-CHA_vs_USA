The project, to be supported by AIIBs first emergency assistance loan, aims to strengthen the public health emergency response capacity in Beijing, the capital of China, and Chongqing, the regional center of western China. The outbreak of COVID triggered Chinas urgent financial need for support in strengthening its capacity in epidemic prevention and control. Cities with large floating populations have particularly acute financial needs to address such challenges, according to AIIB. The loan will support the sustainable development of public health infrastructure, systems and emergency response in the two cities. It will help upgrade their respective centers for disease control and prevention, enhance the treatment capacity of medical institutions in dealing with epidemic emergencies, and provide emergency equipment and supplies to frontline public health workers to help contain the outbreak of COVID. AIIBs response underscores the importance of building resilient public health infrastructure and maintaining robust systems for members to effectively mitigate risks to their populations associated with outbreaks of communicable disease, said AIIB VicePresident Konstantin Limitovskiy. The emergency loan demonstrates AIIBs agility in responding positively and effectively to its members needs during crises, he said.
