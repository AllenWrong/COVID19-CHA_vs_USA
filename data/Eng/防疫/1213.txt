PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY    More efforts are needed to strengthen the education and training of medical talent in the wake of the COVID epidemic, Wang Chen, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said on Thursday. To make up for shortfalls in the public health system exposed by the epidemic, it is important to take measures to attract the most talented to study medicine, provide them with the necessary training and create a good career environment for them, Wang, also a member of the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference National Committee, said ahead of the opening of its annual session on Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, a national medical research institute that is capable of leading Chinas research in medicine should be set up, Wang said. More importance should be paid to the integration of medicine and disease prevention to better cope with challenges by major public health emergencies, he said. While elaborating the key factors for Chinas success in containment of the epidemic, Wang said that Chinese culture values human health and life, and it has been well reflected in the concerted efforts from across the country in fighting the epidemic. The country has become more powerful over the past decades and this fact has also played a very important role in the containment of COVID in China, Wang said.
