Efforts on drugs should be enhanced, scientist says

The use of existing HIVAIDS medication is being widely adopted in China for treating patients infected with novel coronavirus pneumonia.But a top Chinese American HIVAIDS scientist said although that might be appropriate for shortterm emergency use, its not a longterm solution.We need to have drugs that target the protease of the coronavirus, said David Ho, who has made many innovative contributions to the understanding and treatment of HIV infection.In an interview with China Daily, Ho explained that HIV and NCP are quite different, but for many viruses, they all have a protein or enzyme called protease.Instead of using HIVAIDS medication to fight NCP, he said, scientists should develop medicine and vaccine for longterm consideration.Aluvia, a pill containing lopinavir and ritonavir, is suggested by Chinas National Health Commission as one possible treatment for the symptoms of NCP.For HIV itself, drugs that block protease have been developed and used for many years.Lopinavir has been reported to have some level of activity against coronaviruses, Ho said.But the activity is actually very low, so its not likely to be highly effective, he said.According to news reports, doctors in Bangkok, Thailand, have used a combination of HIVAIDS and flu drugs for NCP infection treatment.The treatment approach, which involves the HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir and the flu drug oseltamivir, led to improvements in several patients  going from testing positive to negative within  hours after applying this combination of medicines.The report from Thailand is what we consider an anecdote, Ho said.Its just a single case where the doctor used the HIV protease inhibitor plus a drug called oseltamivir for influenza, he said, adding there is no evidence that the influenza drug works against this virus.You have to bear in mind about  percent of the infected people recovered, so did that case recover because of the drug or because of the natural course? he asked.Having been at the forefront of HIVAIDS research for three decades, Ho is bestknown for championing the combination antiretroviral therapy, popularly known as cocktail therapy. This approach, which combines drugs against HIVAIDS, allowed the control of HIV replication in patients.Ho explained that NCP is very different from HIV. For HIV, if you dont use a combination of drugs, it wont work, he said.For NCP, Ho said its not a necessity that combinations be used, but its a necessity that good drugs be developed, and some of them might work by itself.The number of confirmed cases of NCP rose to , on the Chinese mainland as of Saturday, including  deaths.Ho said that NCP, which has spread very extensively is about three or four times less aggressive than severe acute respiratory syndrome, but is about  times more aggressive than the regular seasonal flu.But when putting this new epidemic in a larger context, Ho said even though the number of the cases is enormous, there are about  million flu cases every year on average and at least ,, if not , deaths from seasonal flu.And the numbers would be much worse for a more aggressive seasonal flu, yet we almost pay no attention to flu, he said.So that would at the moment dwarf this new outbreak, he added.Ho believes weather and environment plays a huge role when estimating the prospects of the epidemic.If we take prior lessons, for example, for seasonal flu, it typically goes away as spring arrives with the warm weather and people are going out, and the virus doesnt stay alive on surfaces for as long, he said.Taking the SARS experience for reference, Ho said it occurred in the late fall , it peaked in the winter months of early . By the time summer arrived, it was almost entirely gone.So thats the natural course that we expect, he said.But exactly when this epidemic will peak, thats what were waiting to see, he added.Ho pointed out that if the new case numbers begin to slow down, then we could expect probably four to six weeks after that, they would be at a natural decline.Good grades for controlSince the outbreak, China has made tremendous efforts in controlling and preventing the epidemic.I would say on the science side, China gets a very good grade, an A for example, he said.Chinese scientists were able to identify the virus, make the diagnostic tests, and share the viral RNA sequences with the world. Thats a remarkable achievement in a very short period of time, he added.On the public health surveillance reporting and transparency side, Ho said it should be further improved.The rule should be very strict  there should not be confusion, and transparency is absolutely required in dealing with epidemics in order to ensure public trust, he added.Currently, the global scientific community is watching the outbreak closely.In the short term, we have nothing, Ho admitted.What were trying to do is to think about how quickly we can develop new drugs, that target not only this virus, but also the SARS virus, the MERS virus and any related coronavirus, said Ho, who is scientific director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and a professor of medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.As the worlds largest private HIVAIDS research center, the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center is committed to finding solutions to end the AIDS epidemic by conducting basic discovery research and by developing novel therapies, vaccines and other prevention strategies.Given this outbreak after SARS and after MERS, we need to develop solutions that are more permanent, Ho stressed.Its not clear whether this  coronavirus will come back in the same form five years from now. It could come from a related coronavirus, he said.So what we need from the scientists is to develop drugs or vaccines that will protect against all or most of the coronaviruses, because the next one may not be exactly the same, he added.Longterm solutionHo called for continued research into promising products that are not limited to one specific coronavirus, but for many in this family and have a longterm solution, he said.Ho said for vaccine development, its going to take much longer, but it should be done.We are looking at the structure of the surface protein of this virus and trying to understand among many different strains, whats conserved and whats variable, he said.From that, we hope to engineer a vaccine that will protect against all coronaviruses. But thats maybe a fiveyear project, he added.In the meantime, Ho said, We could also construct antibodies that would block many different strains of coronavirus. This effort is underway, and we have a team at Columbia that has great deal of experience in antibody development.Collectively, members of our group of scientists have advanced six antibody products into the clinic for human testing, with one already approved by the FDA.Ho said he has already discussed this with colleagues in China. For example, Chris Chen of Wuxi Biologics believes that if we had a good neutralizing antibody against nCoV, his company can get it manufactured in three months.Ho estimated that if the epidemic continues to spread, then some of the drugs that are identified to be active, or some of the antibodies that have been constructed to inactivate the virus, on the time scale of six months, they could be turned into experimental products to be tested here.The novel coronavirus is making Hos team even busier.On very short notice, Hos research team is helping in combating the fastspreading outbreak in China in case the current epidemic does not wane.Ive just been on the phone these past two weeks about how we could work with Wuxi AppTec to take some of their chemistry expertise and put it into our biology program to look for polymerase inhibitors and protease inhibitors and how we may work with them.Specifically, we have assays that could rapidly screen compounds that Wuxi AppTec could provide to us, focusing initially on drugs that have already shown activity against other viral polymerases and proteases.He added that Wuxi AppTec is now preparing those chemical compounds as well as analogues of those compounds for screening.Adding in other chemical entities, we may have to screen as many as , different chemicals, according to Guo Tao who heads its chemistry efforts. But the lab assays to do that is now so fast and efficient. Its definitely feasible, he said.Born in Taiwan in , Ho moved to Los Angeles in the US at the age of .Even though Ive lived threequarters or more of my life in the US, I still feel very much culturally Im Chinese, said Ho. Thats why if there is a problem that pops up in China that I could do something about, I generally run to it, he added.
