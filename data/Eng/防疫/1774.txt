US carmaker Ford Motor Co is seeing signs of steady recovery in China thanks to a raft of dedicated measures that boost its competitive edge in the worlds largest vehicle market. Thanks to lower structural costs, Fords fourthquarter operating loss in China was  percent smaller than in the same period in , according to its  financial results released this month. Last years final quarter was the fourth straight quarter of yearoveryear improvement in China for the second largest carmaker in the US. Fords China performance was one of the highlights of its global financial results. Its adjusted Q earnings before interest and taxes were  million, down  percent. In , Fords adjusted free cash flow was . billion, flat compared to .Revenue was . billion, down  percent yearonyear. Analysts say Fords continuous improvement in China implies its the lackluster performance in recent years will soon end. They attribute the achievement to the carmakers localization campaign in the country, which includes new vehicle launches, better service quality and improved dealership networks. Ford China announced its transformation blueprint in April  to bring together the Best of Ford and the Best of China. The blueprint marks a change in the companys approach to its China business, after it was named in late  as a standalone business unit reporting directly to Fords global headquarters. As part of this transformation, Ford is launching more than  vehicles over the next three years, of which more than  will be electrified vehicles. The company said a lot of the over  new models will be specifically designed for the Chinese market. The success of any global company operating in China lies in ensuring Chinese consumers are at the core of its business, said Anning Chen, president and CEO of Ford China. The company launched several new models in the country in , including sedans and SUVs. It launched threethe new Focus Active SUV, the Edge STSTLine SUV and the new Tauruson a single day last August. The models have brought about significant changes. For example, the Ford Territory sold , units in the fourth quarter, bringing full year sales to , units. Those figures made it the bestselling Ford SUV in the China market last year. The allnew Ford Escape launched in late December has attracted wide attention among Chinese consumers. Customer traffic to dealer showrooms and orders placed have been much higher than expected. Fords highend brand Lincoln is speeding up its efforts to introduce new models as well, including the Nautilus and the Aviator. At the end of , Lincoln kicked off the presales of its Corsair model, the first localized model for Lincoln in China. Lincoln said it will begin delivering the allnew Corsair to Chinese customers in March. Analysts said Ford is steering back on track and laying a foundation for the future. They explained that one of the biggest reasons for Fords sales slump over the past several years was a lack of new models in the worlds largest market where rivals are launching new cars. A growing lineup of models from affordable vehicles to more premium automobiles has also helped boost Fords image as one of the most successful international carmakers. Dealers are finding improvement in their situation as well because Ford has introduced a salesbased production plan, which prevents dealership overstock and improves the companys manufacturing and marketing efficiency. By the end of June , the average dealer stock stood at  days, much better than the industry average and the lowest level in  months, said Jason Yang, president of Fords national distribution services division in China. In the second half of the year, over  percent of dealers were making money, despite the overall sales downturn in Chinas vehicle market. Ford has come up with measures to help tide dealers over during the novel coronavirus outbreak. The epidemic has forced customers away from dealerships. Among other things, the company has canceled dealers sales targets in February, extended interestfree loans for dealers and raised commissions for salespeople. Ford is also stepping up efforts to equip its vehicles with its latest technologies. Last year, the carmaker debuted its SYNC, a new invehicle infotainment system powered by Baidus artificial intelligence technology. It said from  the majority of new domesticallyproduced Ford and Lincoln vehicles will come equipped with SYNC, a nextlevel connectivity experience that was developed specifically for Chinese drivers. Ford said the majority of new models sold in China will also be equipped with its advanced driverassist technologies, including Adaptive Cruise Control and LaneKeeping Assist, to deliver Chinese customers a safer and less stressful driving experience. ?
