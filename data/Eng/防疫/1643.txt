Guangdong can inspire SAR to better serve poorest students

A week after the Guangdong provincial government announced it will provide , poor students with data packages for elearning, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region followed in its footsteps on Friday by announcing assistance for needy students to purchase mobile computer devices for the same purpose. While the difficulties of disadvantaged families in facilitating elearning of their children should have been factored in while announcing territorywide school closure and followup measures in Hong Kong, it is hoped that this policy initiative, though it came in a little late, will be not too little. Even before the Guangdong government had distributed gigabyte data packages among the provinces needy students, it had offered more than , poor students tablets for elearning.       According to media reports, the province will also expand free broadband services in the homes of teaching staff and students. This apart, in a clear directive, Guangdongs education department requires the educational authorities to pay close attention to students with no television and internet access as well as leftbehind children. It is certainly heartening to see the government of a neighboring province keeping in mind the needs of poorest students even in times of unprecedented crisis and accordingly formulating needspecific policies. The aim of universal education is that no child should be left behind, and every time a government takes affirmative action, it translates into more than material benefits  it creates opportunities and encourages even the most leftbehind child to rise above his or her circumstances. There is no greater development accelerator than benevolent governance. Hong Kong, which has a postintervention child poverty rate of . percent as per the Hong Kong Poverty Situation Report , released in December , should have acted sooner when encouraging schools to shift to distance learning for the duration of an epidemicinduced closure. Teachers and private educators working with Hong Kongs poorest children were apprehensive that such children would be left behind as many came from households that lacked WiFi or the ability to purchase devices compatible with elearning needs. As such, the latest initiative of the HKSAR government will be very welcome. Having regard that many students need to use their own mobile computer devices for elearning at home during the class suspension period, all public sector schools implementing elearning can submit applications to the Education Bureau for subsidy under the CCF programme for their students meeting the relevant eligibility criteria, reads a press release issued by the SAR government on Friday. CCF refers to Hong Kongs governmentoperated Community Care Fund, which has been tasked with implementing the assistance program. To be fair, the SAR government has taken a number of steps to alleviate the burden of parents across the spectrum. In a written reply in the Legislative Council on Friday, Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yunhung noted, with reference to spending in Hong Kong dollars, a funding of about HK million  million is allocated from the Antiepidemic Fund newly set up by the government to provide an additional HK, for each recipient of the Student Grant, i.e. an increase from HK, to HK, for the  school year, benefitting some , students, including KG students studying in both SchemeKGs and non SchemeKGs. Also, he noted in the same written reply, In order to help schools replenish their epidemic prevention equipment, clean their school premises and pay for other expenses related to epidemic prevention, the EDB will deploy the existing resources to provide a oneoff Special Antiepidemic Grant to all schools, involving additional spending of HK million, benefiting some , schools. The SAR governments heart is in the right place. But unless targeted remedies are administered along with broadspectrum action, the virus of poverty and resultant lack of opportunities will continue to inhibit Hong Kongs poorest children. There is a big lesson to be learned in benevolent governance from Guangdong.                                                                         !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
