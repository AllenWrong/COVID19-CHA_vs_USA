Fans roar on their heroes during Saturdays League of Legends World Championship final in Shanghai.?GAO ERQIANGCHINA DAILY    And as regards the infrastructure, such as the remote broadcast, and also the government support which is a big thingsometimes elsewhere in the world it is difficult for governments to understand new sports or technology. As the birthplace of Chinas League of Legends Pro League LPL, Shanghai has devoted itself to becoming a center for the competition, and in  the city officially declared its intention to become a global esports hub. Now, over  percent of Chinas esports enterprises, including teams and livebroadcasting platforms, have chosen Shanghai has their base, while over  percent of the nations esports events are staged in the city. Shanghai citizens suddenly find that the atmosphere of esports in the city is getting stronger and stronger in recent years. And the word esports is now common parlance, said Dai Yanmiao, associate professor at Shanghai University of Sport. We must affirm the driving force and cohesion of the esports sector. It has mushroomed from humble beginnings and is now an influential industry that is culturally and financially robust, Dai said. Dai acknowledged that while esports can still be misunderstood or viewed with suspicion by nongamers, he reckons the generation gap is closing, citing the positive social and communication aspects young people derive from gaming. He added, though, that more research was needed into the relationship between young children and esports. For young people, it is fine to embrace it, it is just a part of life. Watching the NBA, soccer and League of Legends should be a combination on a large plate, not the only one. It is simply a new option to add to traditional sports, said Dai. Although Shanghai has become wellversed in staging big esports events over the years, the COVID pandemic presented fresh challenges in staging this years LOL worlds. The city formulated measures to encourage the staging of online esports events. The safetyfirst policy made it possible for Saturdays final to take place on schedule and with a limited number of fans in attendance. With the support of the government and related enterprises, the spring split of the League of Legends season was restarted online in March, becoming the first professional esports competition in China to resume after the outbreak. In such a challenging year, the top priority and most important thing is security, said Leo Lin, coCEO of LOL World Championship organizer TJ Sports. From the first second when all our athletes and staff got off the plane, we provided pointtopoint epidemic prevention protection. We have a very thick stack of epidemic prevention manuals and safetystandard guidelines behind us to guide our thousands of staff to complete all the work in such a challenging period. Professor Dai echoed those sentiments and believes that Shanghai deserves huge credit for its successful staging of the worlds. It could be described as the only largescale international sports tournament that has been held normally in the world so far this year, he said, which is recognition for the strong foundation of the citys esports industry.
