The draft revision to the law on the prevention and control of environmental pollution by solid waste Sunday returned to the National Peoples Congress Standing Committee for the third reading at its ongoing legislative session. Medical waste should be managed according to stipulations of the national category for hazardous waste, and governments at or above the county level should improve their capabilities for the concentrated disposal of medical waste, according to the draft. The draft also proposed better defining the responsibilities of medical institutions and local health and environmental authorities in handling medical waste.
