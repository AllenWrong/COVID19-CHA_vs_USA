That outside of Hubei province, the most hardhit area, the number of new novel coronavirus infections has dropped each day for  days in a row, to  as of Sunday, indicates the epidemic situation is largely being brought under control.Even in Hubei, the number of new infections each day has dropped over the past four days, to below the level before the complicated genetic lab diagnosis was replaced by faster CT scans, which led to a jump in the number of confirmed cases. This is heartening news as the province has borne the brunt of the epidemic which broke out in the provincial capital Wuhan in late December.But while the epidemic situation in the province as a whole may be easing, the fact that the citys share in the provinces number of deaths remains at about  percent and it accounts for  percent of the people infected in the province shows that it is still suffering the most and remains the stronghold of the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
