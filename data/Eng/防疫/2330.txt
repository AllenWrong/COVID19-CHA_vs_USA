Government is confident that platform with Europe is making progress in several fields                     As a beneficial complement to the partnership between China and the European Union, cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries has gone full steam ahead in the global fight against COVID amid efforts in economic recovery.  Since the inception of the ChinaCEEC cooperation mechanism in , it has become an allround, multilevel and wideranging multidimensional platform for mutually beneficial cooperation with positive progress in the fields of trade, investment, contracted engineering projects and connectivity, said Gao Feng, spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce, during a news conference on Thursday.  Following  other countries, Greece became a fullfledged participant of the ChinaCEEC Cooperation in .  Despite the pandemic, trade volume between China and the  countries was still more than  billion last year, up . percent yearonyear, according to the Ministry of Commerce.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, ChinaCEEC cooperation has become much closer. In March, Chinese officials and health experts held a video conference with their counterparts from the  countries to develop information exchange and share experiences about epidemic prevention and control. China has also provided medical assistance and exported antiepidemic protective equipment to the central and eastern European countries in accordance with their needs.  As China committed to making the COVID vaccines it develops a public good to the world, vaccine cooperation has become a new highlight to further enhance antipandemic teamwork between China and the central and European countries.  In midJanuary, Hungarys government said that it has reached a deal with Chinas Sinopharm to buy its coronavirus vaccines. Serbian health authorities also approved the use of Sinopharms COVID vaccines in January, just two days after a million doses were imported from China, enabling the country to begin mass immunization of its population.  China has made it clear that the ChinaCEEC cooperation mechanism is a transregional cooperation platform established in the principle of openness, inclusiveness and transparency according to the shared will of China and the involved countries, and is a component of ChinaEurope cooperation.  Observers said that China and the central and eastern European countries could use the platform to jointly champion multilateralism, strengthen collaborations in fighting the pandemic and explore cooperation in more fields, including technological innovation, the digital economy and green development, in addition to the joint construction of the Belt and Road.  In the postpandemic period, they said the ChinaCEEC cooperation will play an important role in stabilizing and recovering the economy in the region and even the world.  One highlighted area in ChinaCEEC relations is the ChinaEurope Railway Express, which saw record high freight shipments passing through central and eastern Europe to western Europe last year with Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Lithuania and Slovakia having become important passageways and destinations.  Ding Yifan, a research fellow with the Institute of World Development at the State Councils Development Research Center, said that there are strong complementary ties between China and the central and eastern European countries in their industrial development, which helps to create tremendous potential for their further cooperation.  Chinas active engagement with the global economy and its consistent openingup to the rest of the world have also brought business opportunities to the central and eastern European countries as well, Ding said. He added that better alignment of the Belt and Road Initiative with development strategies of those countries could help upgrade and improve the quality of cooperation between them and China.  Through the transregional cooperation platform, China puts emphasis on its connectivity with Europe and regards railways, ports and investment as the foundation for achieving balanced development and social cohesion in Europe.  For example, the Chinesebuilt HungarySerbia railway has greater significance than shortterm economic benefits for the two European countries. It is part of the landsea express line from Piraeus, Greece, across the Balkan Peninsula to the core corridor in Europe, which may be extended to reach more countries.  Marek Hrubec, a faculty member of the Institute of Philosophy at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, said that as the world was challenged by unilateralism in the past years, the ChinaCEEC cooperation mechanism not only helps promote teamwork between China and countries involved in the mechanism, but it also helps strengthen collaborations among the European countries.  caodeshengchinadaily.com.cn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !CDATA            function shareweixin              var ua  navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase              ifiphoneipadipod.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyiosschemeencodeIos                            else ifandroid.testua  ua.matchMicroMessengeri  micromessenger                window.opena.app.qq.comosimple.jsp?pkgnamecom.theotino.chinadailyandroidschemeencodeAndroid                            else                window.openwww.chinadaily.com.cnmobiledaily.html
