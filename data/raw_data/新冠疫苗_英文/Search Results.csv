Simcoe Muskoka prepares to receive child COVID-19 vaccine,"Nov. 22, 2021 9:30 p.m. CST","
     
     BARRIE, ONT. - 
     
    
	The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU) is preparing to receive COVID-19 vaccines for children aged five to 11 this week.

	On Friday, Health Canada announced that it had approved a modified version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children.

	According to SMDHU, it anticipates that the pediatric formulation of the COVID-19 vaccine will be received locally this week, and the health unit will make it available by appointment only through local community clinics, pharmacies and some primary care providers.

	SMDHU expects that appointments for children will become available on the provincial booking system this week.

	""Getting 5-to-11-year-olds vaccinated is safe and the most effective way to protect them from COVID-19. This is the next major step in our efforts, locally and beyond, to protect children and the broader community from the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Dr. Charles Gardner, SMDHU's Medical Officer of Health.

	Health Canada and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) say that preliminary evidence shows the vaccine is 91 per cent effective at preventing COVID-19 in children 5 to 11 years of age, and no serious side effects have been identified, said the statement released by SMDHU.

	The first batch of COVID-19 vaccines for children in Canada landed in Hamilton on Sunday.

"Asian shares mixed after China warning on risks, stagflation","Nov. 22, 2021 2:07 p.m. CST","
     
    
	Stocks were mixed in Asia on Monday after ending the week mostly lower on Wall Street, despite the Nasdaq's first close above 16,000.

	A resurgence of coronavirus outbreaks in the U.S., Europe and some other regions is weighing on investor sentiment. Comments by advisers to the Chinese central bank about risks of ""stagflation,"" meanwhile, have reinforced concerns about inflationary pressures.

	The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.7% to 3,583.37, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.4% to 24,962.11.

	Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% lower to 29,717.58. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 500 gave up 0.4% to 7,368.00.

	Shares fell in India but rose in Taiwan.

	Attention has turned to the People's Bank of China as Beijing strives to curb risks from excessive borrowing by property developers but still keep the economy growing.

	An adviser to the PBOC, Liu Shijin, told a conference over the weekend that China needed to avoid ""quasi-stagflation,"" Bloomberg reported.

	Another economist, Jia Kang, echoed that sentiment, saying that if the pace of economic growth is slower than the inflation rate, ""then how can we formulate a prescription for macro-control?""

	Ting Lu of Nomura noted that controls on property lending, fresh waves of COVID-19 outbreaks and strict policies to fight them and surging prices are all adding to China's policy challenges.

	""A raft of meeting memos and policy reports show that Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned about the growth slump and has begun to take action to shift its policy stance in order to prevent growth from sliding further,"" Ting said in a report.

	On Friday, the S&P 500 index gave up 0.1% to 4,697.96 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% to 35,601.98.

	The Nasdaq added 0.4% to 16,057.44, for its sixth straight gain.

	Smaller-company stocks fell more than the broader market. The Russell 2000 index lost 0.9% to 2,343.16.

	Despite an up-and-down week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched weekly gains, while the Dow posted its second straight weekly loss.

	Some 66% of companies in the S&P 500 fell, with financial and energy stocks accounting for a big share of the pullback. Those losses outweighed gains in technology and a mix of companies that rely on consumer spending.

	Energy related shares fell as U.S. crude oil prices dropped 3.7%.

	U.S. stocks have been mostly pushing higher since early October as companies reported much stronger profits for the summer than analysts expected, with overall earnings growth of about 40%. That's much better than forecasts for 23% growth made back in June.

	Still, companies are facing higher raw materials costs and supply chain problems that could crimp future profits. Consumers have so far absorbed higher prices, but analysts fear they could start economizing if higher prices persist too long.

	The situation is putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to move faster to rein in its ultra-low-rate policies in order to combat rising prices. On Friday, analysts at Bank of America projected that the Fed will likely start raising its benchmark interest rate in the second quarter of 2022, two quarters earlier than they had previously forecast.

	Investors are waiting to see if U.S. President Joe Biden decides to keep Jerome Powell at the Fed's helm.

	Biden is expected to announce within days whom he will choose for the nation's most powerful economic position. Many Fed watchers expect Powell to be offered a second term, though Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, has emerged as a leading alternative.

	In other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 3 cents to US$75.97 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the basis for international pricing, lost 5 cents to $78.84 per barrel.

	The U.S. dollar rose to 114.15 Japanese yen from 113.96 yen on Friday. The euro slipped to $1.1278 from $1.1289.

	Health Canada approved the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 on Friday, and the province said starting Monday at 6:00 a.m., parents can book appointments for their kids to get the shot.

	It's good news for Manitobans like Cara Windle, who plans to make an appointment to get her daughter Sophie on the path to being fully vaccinated.

	""We've been waiting a long time, (we're) really excited. We'll be setting our alarm for 5:55 a.m. to make sure we get her in as soon as we're able,"" she said.

	""I have type one diabetes,"" said Sophie. ""It'll definitely be reassuring to have the (vaccine).""

	The Windles aren't the only family planning to get everyone fully vaccinated. Dave Thomas will be booking an appointment for his 7-year-old son Emmett Monday morning as well.

	""Getting the kids back to a more normal school environment is my number one priority,"" said Thomas.

	""Getting our numbers down in Manitoba to the point where the rest of us can get back to normal is number two for me.""

	Manitoba's Vaccine Implementation Task Force said vaccines for kids ages 5 to 11 will be available at Pharmacies, Physician Clinics, Urban Indigenous Clinics, and Vaccine Clinics so kids can get their doses as easily as possible.

	On Thursday, Medical Lead Dr. Joss Reimer said the province has already been preparing the logistics for the vaccine rollout.

	""We want to be ready in Manitoba so that when the vaccine arrives here, we can start shipping it to locations and administering it to 5 to 11-year-olds as soon as it arrives in the province.""

	First appointments are expected to be available as early as next week.

	Thomas hopes one day his son can learn in an environment that's mask-free.

	""Can't wait,"" he said. ""If I could be first in line, I would be.""

	Cara said getting kids 5 to 11 vaccinated is important, not just for the kids but for everyone around them.

	""It's not just about you. It's about your kids. It's about parents. It's about older people. We all have a duty in society, I think, to protect the most vulnerable.""

Sask. looks to avoid 5th wave as holiday season approaches ,"Nov. 19, 2021 7:00 p.m. CST","
     
     Even as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations decline in the province, health officials say it’s not time to ease up on public health guidelines as they look to avoid a post-holiday season fifth wave.  November modelling numbers from the Saskatchewan Health Authority show how hospitalizations could look in one month.  Dr. Saqib Shahab, the province’s chief medical health officer said continued low mixing behaviour by the public and a slow immunization waning trajectory could result in sustainable numbers in the new year.

       Highs and lows of Sask. vaccination uptake detailed in latest modelling 95 new COVID-19 cases in Sask.; 4 more deaths   (Source: Government of Saskatchewan)  “We have to do everything to avoid scenario number one which is a fifth wave any time in January or February, and stay the course ideally letting our ICU and acute care centres come down really low by January,” he said.  COVID-19 admissions are trending downward in Saskatchewan hospitals. Daily admissions are down 29 per cent in the last two weeks and ICU admissions are down 41 per cent. Saskatchewan remains first among Canadian provinces in hospitalizations and ICU admissions per 100,000 people.  To maintain the downward trends, Shahab said restrictions will likely remain in place through the holiday season. Additional measures are not on the table at this time.  Last week Shahab recommended small gatherings over the holidays and said while it may feel odd, residents are advised to wear masks.  Saskatchewan's health minister says vaccine uptake will be the key to avoiding a fifth wave.  “I think we’re still in around 2,000 vaccines per day, first and second dose,” Paul Merriman said. “We need to increase that. It’s going to jump up when the Johnson & Johnson, and the children are eligible.”  Some of Saskatchewan’s rural communities reported lower than anticipated vaccination uptake, according to the latest COVID-19 modelling.

	Dix said the timeline for when the first shots will go into the arms of youth in B.C. will be unveiled on Tuesday.

	But for now, he's encouraging parents across the province, and ""everybody on Vancouver Island,"" to register their kids for it right away.

	Meanwhile, Ontario's chief provincial health officer, Dr. Kieran Moore, said Wednesday that his province will have vaccine's rolling out for youth later this month. He indicated that the two shots would likely be spaced out by eight weeks.

	Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease expert, says that an eight week interval between shots is thought to improve effectiveness and reduce the odds of any rare complications.

	""If you separate them by (roughly) two months you have a more robust immune response,"" said Bogoch.

	Many parents have been anxiously awaiting this news, as have teachers.

	""Certainly what I'm hearing from teachers is concern about travel over the winter break and what that might mean in January,"" said Winona Waldron, the president of the Greater Victoria Teachers Association.

	The province is also gearing up for a major campaign in the next week to educate and persuade families who are not convinced the shot is a good plan for their children.

	The Middlesex-London Health Unit (MLHU) says it will act “very quickly” to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to children between the ages of five and 11.

	Health Canada announced approval of the use of a pediatric version of the Pfizer vaccine Friday morning.

	For parents of children between five and 11 another big decision is coming -- to vaccinate or not vaccinate their kids against the COVID-19.

	Health officials say the option to vaccinate will be on the table as early as this month.

	MLHU Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Alex Summers says, “The timing of the arrival of the vaccine will dictate when we can start vaccinating kids under 12. But it will happen very quickly.”

	In London, mom Miriam is in a unique spot. Her five-year-old son will be eligible for the vaccine, but Eli, just like his sister and the rest of the family have already battled the illness.

	“We‘ve actually all had COVID, our whole family. They both tested positive and they had hardly any symptoms.”

	But Miriam, who did not want to give her last name, contends she and others faced a tougher fight with the virus even though no one in the family was hospitalized.

	Now, like so many others parents she is looking at vaccination for her kids.

	Once here, vaccines for kids will be distributed at MLHU mass vaccination clinics, along with some pharmacies and health-care centres.

	The availability of early appointments will depend on uptake.

	But Summers says his team has the ability to vaccinate everyone in the five to 11 age group – between 38,000 and 39,000 kids -- within a month.

	“We have the capacity to vaccinate 100 per cent, with one dose, all children in our region through pharmacies, primary care, and mass vax, within the first four weeks that things become eligible.”

	The question remains whether all parents will partake with their kids, but heath officials says if they do, the COVID-19 threat is reduced for everyone.

	Miriam says they haven't yet decided, “We’re still thinking about it. It’s just weighing the risks.”

	Word of children’s vaccines becoming available coincides with the fact the London region is now just a fraction away from 90 per cent of people having a single dose.

	“It makes it so we can’t see his grandmother in the senior’s complex and things,” he told CTV News.

	It’s unclear whether kids who are about to turn five will be able to get the shot similar to what was done with kids who were 11 and about to turn 12.

	Last month, the Government of Saskatchewan announced it ordered 112,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine formulated for children in the five to 11 age group. The shipment is expected to be sent once the vaccine is approved.

	“We’ll be ready as soon as those vaccines hit the ground, as soon as they’re distributed out from the federal government,” Health Minister Paul Merriman said.

	Education Minister Dustin Duncan said the province is looking at making vaccines available at schools or near them so that it is easily accessible.

	“With that age group, we’d want a parent to be present and so, looking at perhaps making it available after school hours so that a parent can be present which might be a little bit easier to accommodate for parents that would be working during the day,” he said.

	Saskatoon Public Schools and Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools are both supportive of the vaccine approval and say it will help keep students, staff and families safe.

	Both school divisions said they are working with the province on how to roll out the vaccines and are offering spaces within their facilities where the vaccine can be administered.

	As for addressing vaccine hesitancy in the younger age groups, Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab says education and scientific data are key.

	“It’s a lower dose vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine, 10 microgram. Adverse events are few and far between, what you would expect with any vaccine, local soreness, in a few cases, the aches and pains for a bit,” he said.

	Shahab said proof of vaccination is not required for kids 12 to 17 and also won’t be required for children five to 11.

Canadian health officials expected to approve Pfizer vaccines for children: report,"Nov. 19, 2021 10:11 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 could soon become a possibility in Canada, a move supported by Alberta, according to reporting by the Toronto Star.

	Sources told the publication that Health Canada officials would be making the announcement approving the Pfizer vaccine for those between ages five and 11 on Friday, and 2.9 million doses are expected to be delivered to Canada by the end of November.

	The U.S. is now administering shots to children as young as five after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted authorization in October.

	Alberta Health officials have made preparations for vaccine rollout by allowing parents and guardians to preregister their children on the online vaccine booking system, but specific timelines have not been unveiled.

	Other provinces – like Manitoba and Ontario – have already laid out comprehensive rollout plans for the age group.

	When asked about Alberta's strategy Thursday, Premier Jason Kenney wouldn't tip his hand.

	Experts say they hope it's an organized plan that can get shots in arms before the Christmas break.

	""These kids can still give the virus to their parents or at risk grandparents,"" infectious disease expert Dr. Craig Jenne told CTV News.

	""They're part of our social circles, and with the holidays coming up we are anticipating a lot more in the way of family gatherings. Likewise, we've seen over the course of the last year how many times classrooms have been disrupted. Things like vaccination is how we avoid that and how we keep outbreaks out of our schools.""

	Since the start of the school year, children between the ages of five and nine have made up the most COVID-19 cases per capita in Alberta.

	According to the province, there is slightly more than 390,000 children in Alberta between the ages of five and 11.

	As well, Alberta Health has no plans to include younger children in the Restrictions Exemption Program where proof of vaccination is required to participate in many activities.

	The province said it would encourage vaccines for younger children.

	""We know from listening to parents the importance of really for that five to 11 year old age group, underlining the fact that it is a parental choice for them to make,"" said Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw on Tuesday,

	""There is a societal benefit to having as many people as possible with vaccine protection, because that does minimize the chances that individuals in that age group would transmit to others.""

	As for vaccine requirements for school settings, the rules for staff and teachers will not be the same for students. Officials do not expect mandates for little ones.

	Education Minister Adriana LaGrange says all students are legally allowed to go to school regardless of their vaccination status.

	LaGrange wrote a letter encouraging school boards to require staff and any adults entering the school to have proof of vaccination or a negative test result.

	The Calgary Board of Education announced last month that it would require staff and volunteers to be vaccinated by Dec. 17.

	There are now 498 people in hospital with COVID-19, including 98 patients in intensive care units. It’s the first time since Aug. 29, that there are both fewer than 500 in hospital and 100 in ICU.

	A full three-quarters of all Albertans, 75 per cent, have had a least a first dose. And, 70.4 per cent of the entire population have had a second dose.

	Earlier Thursday, CTV  News confirmed the federal government is set to announce on Friday that Health Canada has approved the COVID-19 vaccine for children aged five to 11. 

	This resulting drop in eligibility age will also cause the per cent of eligible Albertans to have received a vaccine to drop significantly as well. 

	Other vaccines, including Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen, have not been approved for use in those under 12

	In a statement Thursday, Pfizer Canada said the company is prepared to deliver the pediatric doses to Canada shortly following the Health Canada authorization.

	Region of Waterloo Public Health says that COVID-19 vaccines have prevented thousands of cases, hundreds of severe cases, and dozens of deaths.

	The numbers and other updates were provided at a Wednesday night board of health meeting.

	As of Nov. 9, vaccines are estimated to have prevented 8,284 cases, 895 severe cases, and 157 deaths in Waterloo Region.

	Public health says there are 48,000 children between the ages of five and 11 who will be eligible.

	""By prioritizing these first doses to children, we hope to complete the first rush of children's vaccination in approximately two to two and a half, three weeks,"" said Vickie Murray of the vaccine distribution task force. ""Then we'll be able to continue to provide a variety of vaccination options that makes vaccines easily accessible for all Waterloo Region children.""

	Part of the plans include setting up after school and weekend vaccine clinics at local schools. Public health adds that they're currently in talks with the region's school board to finalize plans.

	Greater Sudbury said Wednesday that 96 per cent of its staff are fully vaccinated or have received at least one dose.

	That means 139 employees have refused the vaccine despite the mandatory vaccine policy, and the city said the majority of them are unpaid leave.

	""Under the policy released in September, all employees are required to be fully vaccinated with an accepted vaccine by Nov. 15, unless they have a valid Human Rights Code-based exemption for medical or religious reasons,"" the city said in a news release.  Northern Ontario COVID-19 coverage

	""As of end of day Nov. 15, more than 2,700 employees have provided their vaccination status, with nearly 94 per cent fully vaccinated. Of the remaining city employees, just over two per cent have received a single dose, three per cent are not vaccinated and one per cent have not declared their status. There is currently one approved exemption.""

	About 60 per cent of employees who are not vaccinated or did not declare their status are part-time/casual workers. That means there will be minimal service interruptions to the public, the city said.

	“As we continue to see a concerning rise in the number of COVID-19 cases locally, we remain committed to doing all we can to reduce transmission and ease the burden on our healthcare system,” Greater Sudbury Mayor Brian Bigger said in the release.

	“Being fully vaccinated continues to be the best protection against COVID-19 and the Delta variant, and I want to thank our employees for doing their part to protect the well-being of our community.”

	“We adopted this policy so that people can enter city facilities knowing that we are taking the proper steps to keep them safe and healthy,” said CAO Ed Archer said in the release.

	“We join many other public and private-sector organizations across the country in implementing this public health measure, and I am pleased to see the positive response from the vast majority of our employees.”

	The policy applies to all city employees, students, members of council and volunteers at city facilities or workplaces. The policy will also apply to members of council-appointed committees when these meetings move from virtual to in-person.

	Effective Nov. 15, the city has also expanded proof of vaccination requirements to include some additional municipal facilities. More details are available here.

How to talk to loved ones about vaccine status ahead of the holidays,"Nov. 17, 2021 4:45 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	With the holidays coming up in just a few weeks, many Manitobans are hoping to get together with their family and friends to celebrate.

	However, with current gatherings restrictions and people having various comfort levels around unvaccinated individuals, this could lead to some uncomfortable conversations.

	According to psychologist Dr. Syras Derksen, it is a tricky time.

	He said people will need to think about their boundaries and comfort levels.

	“It can be hard to balance our own feelings about these things, our own assessment of our own risk, against the feelings of others and how people are going to respond to us,” Derksen said.

	He said when approaching difficult conversations, research shows it is good to start by saying something positive, adding that it is useful to find a way to compliment the person in a way that is related to the topic at hand.

	“So if you were going to say something about somebody’s cooking, you might say, ‘You’re a great cook,’ and then you could go on to say your criticism about what they made for you that day,” he said.

	Derksen noted that when approaching the topic of vaccines, it’s good to add in sentiments that show the other person you still like them and aren’t trying to avoid them, such as “I really wish you could be there.”

	He said that you could also show you’re thinking about everyone’s well-being by saying, “I’m not just protecting my own risk, but I’m also protecting everybody’s risks.”

	NAVIGATING HURT FEELINGS

	Derksen said that during these conversations, there will be hurt feelings on both sides.

	He said it’s important that to recognize your feelings, so you don’t end up saying something you regret.

	“Sometimes we’re so focused on the other person’s feelings, we don’t realize that we’re actually being hurt by the fact that this person’s not going to be there or you feel, maybe frustrated, that the person didn’t get vaccinated,” he said.

	Derksen explained it’s also important to have conversations about vaccines and COVID-19 in advance, so people don’t get their hopes up about a holiday that may not end up happening.

	“If they’re picturing a certain kind of Christmas, a certain kind of holiday, and then, later on, you take that away from them by telling them your boundaries, that’s going to be a bigger loss than if they’re prepared and they can envision something a little more accurately,” he said.

	RECOGNIZE DIFFERENCES

	Derksen said it is important to recognize there will be differences of opinions when it comes to vaccines.

	“There are so many pieces of information that go into this,” he said.

	“Everybody’s risk and everybody’s vulnerability and everybody’s ideas around these things are so different.”

	He noted that it’s important to have a tolerance for people’s differences and be aware that others may not feel the same way as you.

	That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t be in a relationship, he said.

	“Communicating that and being aware of those differences is really important.”

	Derksen noted it’s generally ineffective to try to pressure people to do things your way.

	“Putting on heaps of pressure or negative criticisms or insults, those things don’t generally work in persuading people,” he said, noting that setting boundaries is already a persuasion.

	He noted it’s important not to mix telling people what you’re comfortable with and persuasion.

	“You don’t want to tell them, ‘This is what I’m comfortable with,’ and then say, ‘You should really be doing this.’ You want to leave that for another conversation,” Derksen said.

	After reporting a 99 per cent compliance rate on Tuesday, Kelly Paleczny said, “The health and safety of our employees and our riders has been a top priority throughout the pandemic.”

	London Transit has approximately 650 employees, with about 350 drivers. Staff were given until Nov. 12 to offer proof of full vaccination or to have requested an accommodation.

	According to Paleczny, 96 per cent of employees have provided proof of vaccination, the other three per cent have provided an approved request of accommodation or are off the job. As for those who did not comply with the policy, Paleczny says, “I can say it’s under 10 employees and that group of employees is currently off work and on unpaid leave.”

	The LTC General Manager says the commission is keeping the lines of communication open with those employees.

	“We direct them to information, to do their homework, see their doctor, have those consultations and make the choice that’s right for them. So, certainly we are continuing to work with that group of employees.”

	The commission has been dealing with a shortage of drivers due to resignations, many related to the pandemic, but Paleczny says the workers on leave aren’t further complicating that issue and she adds that vaccine requirements hasn’t been an issue with new hires.

	“It’s been a requirement for anybody we onboard and we’ve not seen any pushback from that as we continue to hire.”

RVH visitors must show proof of vaccination,"Nov. 16, 2021 3:40 a.m. CST","
     
     BARRIE, ONT. - 
     
    
	Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre (RVH) in Barrie now requires proof of vaccination for visitors.

	Visitors or those attending the hospital with a patient will have to prove that 14 days have passed since their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and show identification. If they are not vaccinated, visitors will have to provide documentation that they have a medical exemption. Visitors will also be required to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and go directly to and from the patient room.

	Suppose the visitor or essential caregiver does not have proof of vaccination or an exemption. In that case, the hospital will provide exceptions if the patient is a child, in palliative care, in labour, experiencing a life-altering illness or if the patient requires a support person due to an underlying condition.

	Currently, patients are allowed one visitor per day for one hour. Visits must be scheduled in advance by calling the inpatient unit before 6 a.m. More information can be found here.

New study shows 11 per cent of Sask. residents refusing COVID-19 vaccine ,"Nov. 16, 2021 2:49 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	A new study from researchers at the University of Saskatchewan is providing more insight into factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal among Saskatchewan residents. 

	The study, which included just over 9,000 participants in Saskatchewan, found 76 per cent were willing to or had been vaccinated against the virus; 13 per cent had not decided; and 11 per cent said they would not get vaccinated.

	According to the peer-reviewed article, a lower level of education, financial instability and indifference to spreading COVID-19 to others were all factors that contributed to vaccine refusal or skepticism.

	Those who said they were only “somewhat concerned” about spreading the virus were nearly three times more likely to reject vaccinations, while respondents who reported a “slight concern” were 7.4 times more likely to say no to the shot.

	Participants who identified as Indigenous were 2.4 times more likely to turn down the vaccine and 1.7 times more likely to be unsure of the jab. Women and newcomers were also more likely to be skeptical of the shot, while Saskatoon residents were less likely to outright refuse.

	Researchers said the belief COVID-19 is a threat to the community and believing one is at a high risk of death or illness because of the virus lowered the possibility of vaccine refusal and hesitancy.

	Respondents who thought COVID-19 is a “very/fairly big” threat were 86 per cent less likely to refuse vaccination and 57 per cent less likely to be wary of the shot compared to those who believed the threat was “very/fairly small.”

	Researchers said they hope the results of the study will provide some direction for targeted efforts to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake across the province.

B.C. family plans to cross U.S. border to get COVID-19 vaccine for 8-year-old child,"Nov. 14, 2021 10:38 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Health Canada could approve a COVID-19 vaccine for children aged five to 11 later this month, but for some families, that isn’t soon enough.

	Vancouver resident Geoff Berner is taking his eight-year-old daughter south of the border, where the Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine is available to kids under the age of 12. On Nov. 22, she’ll be vaccinated at a Walmart in Bellingham, Wash.

	“We’re getting the vaccine early because we don’t feel it’s safe for our kid to be in B.C.,” said Berner.

	He criticizes the provincial government for easing restrictions, despite the coronavirus still spreading and the death toll growing.

	“Every time they manage to get the numbers down, they just open more things,” he said. “They opened (Rogers Arena) and have 18,000 people drinking beer with no masks, then turn around and say, ‘Keep your Christmas gatherings as small as you can.’”

	At least one family doctor doesn’t see an issue with concerned parents getting their kids vaccinated stateside, as long as they’re aware of the implications.

	“It’s not as simple as getting in the car, crossing the border, getting your kid vaccinated, then coming home,” said Dr. Anna Wolak.

	Anyone who crosses into the United States will need to show proof of a negative PCR test upon returning to Canada. Each test could cost upwards of $100. Additionally, federal law requires children under 12 to stay home from school or day care for 14 days after their arrival.

	It’s not an issue for Berner, who’s homeschooling his child because of concerns around the spread of COVID-19 in schools.

	“If the government did more to protect children, like brought in proper ventilation in schools and did rapid testing and things that work in other places, we wouldn’t need to run across the border to get the vaccine,” he said.

	Last week, Canada’s chief medical advisor Dr. Supriya Sharma said Health Canada is actively continuing its review of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine for children, which was authorized for use in the U.S. earlier this month.

	The under-12 population, the only group ineligible for COVID-19 vaccines, continues to have the highest incidence rate of the virus nationwide.

	Wolak is hopeful that once the vaccine is approved, it will be made available immediately.

	“Parental anxiety is heightened at the moment. We need to get (vaccination for children under 12) addressed, so we know they are protected and parents can breathe a sigh of relief,” she said.

Winnipeg sport league's tightened COVID-19 protocols useful amid new restrictions  ,"Nov. 15, 2021 8:53 p.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	The province is trying to curb transmission in teen sports as COVID-19 cases surge among Manitoba’s youth, but some recreational sports leagues are far ahead of the coming restrictions.

	At a Saturday morning game for the U16 B St. James Boom ringette team, goalie Paige Follette is ready to play.

	Playing for nine years, Follette says the sport is vital for him in staying busy and healthy.

       Manitoba introduces new public health restrictions to reduce COVID-19 case numbers

	""It's pretty important because it plays a toll on mental health and it's one of the things makes me really happy, so it's really important,"" she said.

	The Winnipeg Ringette League, which the team is a part of, mandated all players had to be doubled vaccinated at the start of the season.

	A rule that might have had some backlash, but made many parents glad.

	""As a parent I'm happy,” said James Follette, Paige’s dad. “Both my parents are immunocompromised so I was vaccinated quite some time ago and so was my daughter as soon as she had the ability to.""

	The league said it implemented the rules to ensure it wouldn't have to change or add anything if the government made stricter restrictions.

	It is a move that's now paying off.

	MANITOBA'S NEW RULES AROUND VACCINATIONS FOR INDOOR YOUTH SPORTS

	On Friday, the province announced Manitobans aged 12 to 17 playing in indoor recreational sports will need to have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or show a negative test taken 72 hours before game time.

	The new rule takes effect on Dec. 6.

	Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, said the new rule was prompted by modelling which shows case counts are increasing most rapidly among youth between the ages of zero and 19.

	Epidemiologist Cynthia Carr, founder of EPI Research, told CTV News she understands the province's new vaccine requirement rule, but would like some more details.

	""It is a little bit confusing. It would be helpful to have some more data about what sort of led to that decision in terms of how do we know that group might have more challenges in vaccination rates versus just kids in general that are getting together in school,"" she said.

	""I think we need to understand more about, again, where the gaps are in young people being vaccinated, and what information and support parents need to make these decisions.""

	'IT WORKED': RINGETTE LEAGUE SAYS MANDATE HAD WORKED WELL

	As for Jennifer Kingsley, vice president of the Winnipeg Ringette League, she said the league's decision to require vaccines at the beginning of the season – months before the province would require them to be – has worked out well.

	""We are willing to stand there and say the health of everyone is more important than a little bit of problems for us to do it,"" Kingsley said. ""So we did that and it worked.""

	Nancy Tovell, the Boom's head coach, said the league's foresight is taking away the stress of scrambling to check vaccination status now.

	""I feel it was lifting me off a lot of other things as a coach. I didn't have to worry about vaccinated and unvaccinated girls mixing on my team and potentially transferring the virus,"" said Tovell.

	As for players like Follette, she said she would meet any restriction as long as it means staying on the ice.

	""They're pretty easy to follow. It's just like a little adjustment. If it means I get to keep playing ringette, then I'll definitely follow them.""

'We are full capacity and have only two beds available now'; STEGH facing 'dire situation',"Nov. 14, 2021 7:13 a.m. CST","

	CTV News had planned to speak to St. Thomas-Elgin General Hospital (STEGH) Chief of Staff Dr. Waleed Chehadi Saturday, regarding what he is calling a 'dire situation' in his hospital. However he is so busy dealing with patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) he couldn't leave his post.

	""It is very busy and patients are very acute and sick,"" says Dr. Chehadi who only had time to answer one question.

	""I am constantly thinking about the next patient that's going to come through and whether I'm going to be able to care for them.""

       MLHU reports 16 new COVID-19 cases, one death Saturday 

	STEGH President and CEO Karen Davies took Dr. Chehadi's place for the interview.

	""We're at full capacity and there's only two hospital beds available right now,"" says Davies.

	""We added 22 extra beds to this hospital many months ago because of the pandemic and the increase in the occupancy. Having 13 extra COVID patients makes a big difference because those patients are really resource intensive.""

	Davies says 13 patients doesn't seem like much, but it's pushed their ICU to the limit.

	""Our ICU capacity, which is level three (the highest level) is at capacity, and because of that we've had to send to COVID patients requiring a level of care to London in the last 18 hours.""

	Hospital officials say the number of cases in Elgin County is rising at an unprecedented rate with more than 150 active positive cases in Southwestern Public Health (SWPH).

	Patients needing critical care are at the highest it has been since the start of the pandemic.

	SWPH has seen double digit positive cases daily recently, and a few COVID-19 related deaths.

	Eighty-four per cent of the region is double-vaccinated, but the unvaccinated are driving the hospital cases. That includes the N5H postal code in Aylmer, Ont. and Malahide Township.

	""We do serve as a community that has a high rate of not being vaccinated, and all 13 COVID patients in hospital are unvaccinated,"" says Davies.

	""So they are coming into our emergency department. Our message to them is first and foremost, please get vaccinated, wear a mask and be kind. If you can't get vaccinated, you choose not to get vaccinated and you're sick with COVID like symptoms, please don't wait to seek care. We're seeing people that are staying home until they're very sick and critically ill and then coming to the emergency department. It's easier and better outcomes for them if they come and seek care earlier.""

	Earlier this week Medical officer of health Dr. Joyce Lock said it's very important that everyone in the region has access to a hospital bed if necessary.

	""I think there is an onus on us to perhaps take more stringent measures and we are re-evaluating capacity limits,"" says Lock.

	""We're going to be looking very carefully at the data to determine whether that would help prevent the spread and free up some more space within our health care institutions.""

	Lock says if you haven't been vaccinated, now is the time to help relieve stress on STEGH.

	""If you had a vaccine and you do happen to get the infection it will be much more mild,"" says Lock.

	""You have about a 30 to 35 per cent less chance being up in the ICU and you have about a 20 per cent less chance of ending up in the hospital. We have seen deaths in our community recently with people who had COVID so it is a reality out there. That it's still a very serious illness much, much more serious for those who are unvaccinated.""

	Davies is worried going forward that as people start moving indoors this trend could continue.

	""Our accountability is to make sure that we're available to care for the residents of St. Thomas and Elgin County,"" says Davies.

	""People need our Emergency Department as they have accidents, heart attacks, they fall off ladders putting Christmas tree lights up, and we still need to be here for them. My concern right now is our ICU is at full capacity. And should somebody need level three ICU care, we'll have to send them outside of our hospital.""

A total of 22 residents and four staff members at the home have now tested positive. Public Health says they are working with the facility to prevent further spread, and have implemented increased public health measures and restrictions.

	CRACKDOWN IS COMING

	With 21 of the cases in the northern and western zones, where health officials say community spread is occurring, enforcement is being stepped up.

	On Nov. 5, the operators of the Woods Harbour Community Centre were given a fine of more than $11,600.

	""We received a complaint from the community about events being held in contravention of public health restrictions,"" said Cpl. Chris Marshall of the Nova Scotia RCMP.

	Marshall says officers visited the centre on Oct. 21 and Oct. 24, offering education on what COVID-19 protocols are in place.

	""In speaking to them, that's when we learned that they had been advised by the community centre management that there was no need for them to follow health restrictions,"" Marshall said.

	Wayne Malone is the community centre's president.

	""Everyone knows that COVID protocols need to be followed,"" he said. ""We have it listed on our door, we have our signage, everything is there.""

	He says the board will appeal the fine in court.

	""We're all family oriented, we get birthday parties, baby showers. We're an adult learning center,"" Malone said. ""I'm looking into getting a mental wellness centre going because it's huge or this past two years.""

	In a statement, Public Health says the fourth wave of COVID-19 is still washing over the province, and enforcement of protocols will continue.

	Any compliance action takes into consideration the risk to public health and the willingness of the business or organization to comply with this protocol.

	Malone says if the fine is upheld, the centre will close.

	EXPOSURE NOTICE FOR SEVEN SCHOOLS

	Health officials also sent exposure notices for seven schools in the province on Wednesday and Thursday.

	The latest school exposures are at Hants East Rural High School in Milford, Millwood High School in Middle Sackville, Basinview Community School and Rocky Lake Junior High in Bedford, Cunard Junior High, and Burton Ettinger Elementary and Fairview Junior High in Halifax.

	“It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious,” said N.S. Health in a release.

	A list of schools with exposures is available online.

	COVID-19 CASE DATA

	Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 3,451 on Wednesday and 2,552 tests on Thursday. A total of 1,347,985 COVID-19 tests have been processed since the start of the pandemic.

	There were 28,019 rapid tests administered between November 5 and 11. This includes 2,114 rapid tests at the pop-up sites in Halifax, Dartmouth, Amherst and Annapolis Royal and 25,905 through the workplace screening program. Another 11,558 home rapid tests were distributed at the pop-up sites.

		3 (8.3 per cent) were partially vaccinated
	
		28 (77.8 per cent) were unvaccinated


	VACCINE UPDATE

	The province's COVID-19 online dashboard provides an update on the number of vaccines that have been administered to date.

	As of Friday, 1,593,242 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 772,138 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 6,642 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

	In total, 83.4 per cent of the province's overall population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 78.9 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their second dose.

	The province says it has received a total of 1,661,340 doses of COVID-19 vaccine since Dec. 15, 2020.

These are the B.C. regions that had the most COVID-19 cases last week,"Nov. 13, 2021 5:43 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	With British Columbia averaging about 500 new cases of COVID-19 per day and 3,500 per week, the latest data from the province's COVID-19 Surveillance Dashboard shows which parts of B.C. are seeing the most coronavirus transmission. 

	The local health area that saw the largest number of cases from Nov. 2 through 8 was Abbotsford, which added 267 new infections during the period.

	The local health area that makes up most of the City of Surrey had the week's second-highest caseload, recording 227.

	The Central Okanagan region had the highest total for the week in Interior Health, at 191, while Nanaimo - at 137 - recorded the highest total on Vancouver Island.

	In Northern Health, the Prince George local health area saw 119 new cases, and Vancouver City Centre led the way for Vancouver Coastal Health with 63.

	Those numbers only tell part of the story, however. Looking at the rate of new infections per 100,000 residents offers a different perspective on how much coronavirus transmission is happening in a region.

	By this metric, Abbotsford retains the highest caseload in Fraser Health, but falls significantly behind other regions of the province for per-capita cases.

	Abbotsford recorded 23 cases per 100,000 residents from Nov. 2 through 8, and Surrey, with its large population, recorded just six.

	The highest per-capita case rate in the province during the week in question was found in the sparsely populated Vancouver Island West local health area, which saw 68 cases per 100,000 residents.

	In Northern Health, the Nisga'a region had the highest per-capita caseload, at 52 per 100,000. Several other local health areas were close behind, however, with Terrace recording 50 cases per 100,000, Quesnel recording 49 and Snow Country/Stikine/Telegraph Creek recording 48.

	The highest case rate in Interior Health was 38 per 100,000 in Cariboo/Chilcotin, and in Vancouver Coastal Health the highest rate was 26 per 100,000 in the Central Coast local health area.

	Notably, despite their high rates of COVID-19 transmission, many of these local health areas are trending in the right direction.

	Both Abbotsford and Surrey saw their per-capita case rates decline slightly last week, compared to the week before, and the rate in the Nisga'a local health area dropped dramatically, from 178 during the previous week.

	Vancouver Island West's rate for the week was down from 108 cases per 100,000 the week before, and Central Coast's declined from 78.

	Cariboo/Chilcotin saw its rate rise slightly, from 34 during the previous week, and several regions in Northern Health - including the aforementioned Terrace, Quesnel and Snow Country/Stikine/Telegraph Creek local health areas - saw increases in the per-capita case rates.

	The local health area with the largest increase in per-capita cases from week to week was Vancouver Island North, which went from just five cases per 100,000 residents during the week of Oct. 26 to Nov. 1 to 44 cases per 100,000 during the week of Nov. 2 to 8.

	Most of the people testing positive in B.C. are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The unvaccinated made up 58.2 per cent of new cases in the province between Nov. 1 and 7, despite accounting for less than 20 per cent of the total population of the province, including children under age 12, who are not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. 

	According to the surveillance dashboard, the province saw 139.5 cases per 10,000 residents among unvaccinated people between Oct. 12 and Nov. 8, compared to 34.9 cases per 10,000 among those with one dose of vaccine and 14.2 per 10,000 among those with both doses.

Alberta premier dismisses Opposition bid to censure him over handling of COVID-19,"Nov. 11, 2021 7:46 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	Alberta Premier Jason Kenney is dismissing an Opposition bid to have him formally censured in the legislature for his handling of COVID-19's fourth wave.

	Kenney says he is focused on getting Alberta's economy moving again and doesn't have time for what he calls cynical political gamesmanship.

	The Opposition NDP has been pushing for answers on why Kenney's government failed to act in August when case numbers were rising alarmingly, which led to intense pressure on hospitals the following month and 15,000 cancelled surgeries.

	Justice critic Irfan Sabir, suggesting Kenney must be held accountable for decisions that led to a great deal of suffering, says his party will introduce the censure motion when the house resumes sitting on Monday.

	Kenney has faced criticism from members of his own United Conservative caucus on his handling of COVID-19, and Sabir says a censure vote would be a chance for them to stand up for their constituents.

	Kenney notes that the pandemic's fourth wave has receded since public health rules and incentives were put in place in September, but says more work needs to be done.

	“We're glad to see that the fourth wave is clearly come under control and that the numbers have come down sharply since our government took measures - and thanks to Albertans stepping up to the plate,” Kenney said Wednesday at a news conference in Grande Prairie, Alta.

	“Our eye is on the ball, focused on protecting lives and livelihoods through whatever is left of COVID.

	“(This is) more political games from the NDP that sadly has treated COVID-19 not as an opportunity to come together, but rather for division. They have sought to politicize COVID-19 in Alberta from Day 1.”

	Sabir said the motion will read: “Be it resolved that the Legislative Assembly censure the premier for his failed leadership leading up to and through the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

	Alberta was forced to more than double the number of intensive care beds and call in military medical help during the height of the latest wave.

	Kenney has said he didn't act in August because he did not receive any recommendations from Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health.

	He has also said he wasn't sure strict health measures would have worked given Alberta's COVID-weary population.

	He has rejected an NDP call for an all-party inquiry into the fourth wave. He has said there will be time after the health crisis has passed to review what went right and wrong.

	On Tuesday, Hinshaw said the number of new cases has dropped significantly, but pressure on health care remains concerning.

	There were more than 6,000 active cases and 582 people in hospital Wednesday with the illness. Of those, 123 people were in intensive care.

	A total of 3,164 Albertans have died from COVID-19.

	The provincial measures introduced in September included a $100 incentive to get vaccinated and a form of vaccine passport to get into non-essential services.

	Alberta's passport, called a restrictions exemption, is voluntary, but businesses that don't sign up must comply with other rules, including severely restricted customer capacity.

	The province has developed a QR code as proof of vaccination, Albertans must download and show that code starting Monday if they want to visit restaurants, bars, movie theatres, casinos, concert halls and sporting venues.

	Alberta's fourth wave woes were tied to low vaccination rates compared with other jurisdictions in Canada. That rate has since climbed significantly. For those eligible, 12 and over, the inoculation rate sits at almost 88 per cent for a first dose and 81 per cent for full vaccination.

	This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 10, 2021.

     ""Get your vaccine, and stop spreading COVID!""  Those are the words of Aylmer BIA Chair Kevin Cross, fearing potential lockdowns by Southwestern Public Health (SWPH).  A combination of rising COVID-19 cases and low vaccination rates in the Aylmer area, as well as limited hospital capacity in St. Thomas has SWPH evaluating all options.

The N5H postal code, which includes the town of Aylmer, has the lowest vaccine uptake rate in the province.  ""It's something that we're not proud of in Aylmer and Malahide (Township) and right from the get-go there has always been resistance to the vaccine,"" says Malahide Township Mayor Dave Mennill.  The town of 7,500 people has been in the national spotlight since the beginning of the pandemic.  Aylmer has low vaccination rates and high COVID-19 case counts (27 ongoing). With a crude rate of 360 cases per 100,000 population -- SWPH has the second highest COVID-19 rates in Ontario.  Eighty-four per cent of people in SWPH have two doses, but it is the 16 per cent that are driving the case count.  Of the total positive COVID-19 cases in SWPH, approximately 78 per cent of them are unvaccinated.  Public Health Sudbury has recently rolled back to Step 3 restrictions after daily case counts surpassed 100.    SWPH could potentially do the same if the spread isn't curbed.  ""I think what's most important to all of us is to be sure that there is a hospital bed there for us when we need it, for whatever cause,"" says Lock.  ""St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital is running at a capacity rate of 130 per cent or more at the moment. They have about 12 patients with COVID in the hospital. So I think there is an onus on us to perhaps take more stringent measures and we are re-evaluating capacity limits. So we're going to be looking very carefully at the data to determine whether that would help prevent the spread and free up some more space within our health care institutions.""  Potential restrictions are concerning for Cross as both an Aylmer, Ont. resident and business owner.  ""It's a fear of lockdown, especially for us going into the Christmas season, because it's the biggest time where you know we can hopefully recover some of the losses from the lockdowns in the past,"" says Cross, who owns Durkee's on Talbot Street.

""My hope is by Christmas time we'll be back up to where the rest of the provinces is in that over 90 per cent (vaccine rate),"" says Mennill.  ""There is so many kinds of religious groups and people that aren't vaccinated, which is so unfortunate because they're not looking at the science that says that most of these people that are in the hospital right now are unvaccinated. That should be proof that the vaccine does work.""

	The County of Wellington issued a pandemic goal to end its state of emergency at midnight on Dec. 31, 2021.

	According to a press release, in order for this to happen two criteria have been set out: continued decline in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, and start of COVID-19 vaccination for children aged five to 11.

	The decision was made in consultation with the medical officer of Health for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.

	“After nearly 20 months of a global pandemic, it is time to chart a path back to something more normal for all of us,” said Dr. Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health and CEO for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health. “Ending the pandemic is a job for all of us. Please continue to follow public health guidance so that as we approach the time to ease restrictions, we are as safe and as ready as we can be.""

	The state of emergency in Wellington County was declared on March 23, 2020 in response to the pandemic.

	It allows Warden Kelly Linton to issue orders to protect the health, safety, property and welfare of residents.

	It also has allowed the county to rapidly redeploy staff to assist at the Wellington Terrace Long Term Care Home and in COVID-19 vaccination clinics

	“I have spoken with City of Guelph Mayor Cam Guthrie and Dufferin County Warden Darren White, and we are all on the same page,” Linton said in the release. “While there is no longer a need for a local state of emergency to be in place, the pandemic is not over. I continue to urge all residents to get vaccinated and continue to follow guidance from Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.”

	Officials noted nearly 80 per cent of eligible Wellington County residents have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

	Other groups are in the queue.

	""Towards the end of the month we will be able to open, to deliver third dose vaccinations to priority groups,"" said Nova Scotia’s Health Minister Michelle Thompson.

	She says that distribution will look similar to the province's original age-based vaccination plan.

	""People 80 years and older will be immunized first and then we will move to the 70 to 79 group and we will continue from there,"" Thompson said.

	""Also frontline health-care workers who have a vaccination with less than 28 days between their initial two doses.""

	Nova Scotians who received two shots of AstraZeneca or one dose of the Janssen vaccine will also be on the priority list.

	Cumberland North MLA Elizabeth Smith-McCrossin isn't happy with the speed of the roll-out.

	""We need to get our third shot, our booster into arms now (especially) our most vulnerable. That needs to be made a priority,"" Smith-McCrossin said.

	Those wishing to travel are also eagerly awaiting their booster with the hope that another shot of Pfizer will make international travel more accessible.

	Industry experts caution however that protocols can still change without much notice.

	""It's really important to check with those destinations, monitor what the requirements are currently with a trusted travel advisor to help you negotiate and plan ahead for what you might find when you get there,"" said Steve Olmstead, CAA’s public affairs director.

	There is also growing concern over an outbreak at East Cumberland Lodge, a long-term care home in nearby Pugwash, N.S.

	There is community spread, says public health, as a result of a faith gathering in the area last month, although it won't confirm where.

	""It was a multi-day gathering and there was approximately 100 people that attended the gathering,"" Dr. Shelley Deeks, Nova Scotia's deputy chief medical officer said on Monday.

	One Amherst church did hold such an event in late October.

	The pastor for Gospel Light Baptist Church would not speak to CTV News on camera, but Pastor Robert Smith calls what happened ""unfortunate"" and told CTV the event followed the rules for faith gatherings, which do not require proof of vaccination.

	He says parishioners did what 811 told them to when they learned of an exposure.

	""On Friday, Dr. Strang did reach out to faith-based leaders to clarify when proof of vaccine requirements are needed,"" Deeks said.

	Smith says 70 per cent of parishoners at the church are fully vaccinated, and the church is working with Nova Scotia Public Health.

	""I made some comments that people might have felt were misleading. And to anybody who felt misled by those comments, I take full responsibility for those comments,"" Rodgers said Tuesday.

	""I understand that this issue, in general, is very charging to a lot of people because we are talking about public health. I totally respect that,"" Rodgers said. ""I made a decision that was in the best interest based on consulting with my doctors. And I understand that not everybody is going to understand that necessarily. But I respect everybody's opinion.""

	Rodgers told McAfee he is feeling ""really good"" after testing positive for COVID-19 last week.

	Rodgers missed last Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs due to COVID-19 protocols. The Chiefs defeated the Packers 13-7.

	During an interview on McAfee's show Friday, Rodgers confirmed he is unvaccinated against COVID-19 and is disappointed with the treatment he's been receiving in the media.

	Rodgers said the media was on a ""witch hunt"" to find out which players were vaccinated and blamed reporters for him saying he was ""immunized"" back in August. Rodgers said if any reporter would have asked a follow-up question, he would have explained he's ""not an anti-vax flat earther,"" but that he's a ""critical thinker.""

	Rogers added last week that he has been following the strict NFL protocols for unvaccinated players to a ""T."" Rodgers described the testing he is subjected to every day, even on off days, and believes the rules are in place to shame unvaccinated people. Rodgers said he was tested over 300 times before testing positive this week.

	He did not get vaccinated because he has an allergy to an ingredient in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and was scared about the possible side effects from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, he said. The decision to seek alternative treatments was ""what was best for my body,"" he said.

	Rodgers is expected to play this Sunday at home versus the Seattle Seahawks.

"'This hasn't been an easy choice': Unvaccinated hospital worker explains her decision, braces for termination","Nov. 10, 2021 6:48 a.m. CST","
     
     Kitchener - 
     
    
	Krista Ruddy says she has enjoyed working as a medical lab assistant at Grand River Hospital for the past two years.

	But a month ago, the 39-year-old New Hamburg woman was placed on unpaid leave because she has chosen not to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

	“They gave me options that I was completely compliant with. I did my education training, I did my testing twice weekly that they asked me to,” said Ruddy. “I complied with everything they asked me to.”

	In September, Waterloo Wellington hospitals issued a mandate, requiring all staff to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 12 or be placed on unpaid leave.

	The new mandate was a joint initiative between Cambridge Memorial Hospital, Grand River Hospital, Groves Memorial Community Hospital, Guelph General Hospital, Homewood Health Centre, North Wellington Health Care Alliance and St. Mary’s General Hospital.

	Those who were unvaccinated had until Nov. 9 to comply with the mandate, or face disciplinary measures, including termination.

	Ruddy says she has a meeting scheduled with hospital management on November 18.

	“We got sent a letter stating that our job is in review. Here’s your date. Here’s your time. And that’s basically all we know,” said Ruddy.

	Ruddy said her decision not to get the COVID-19 vaccine was a personal one.

	“It’s still in trial. Like it’s in clinical trials. I’m too afraid to get something put into my body that I can’t get changed,” she explained.

	The Pfizer vaccine is one of the approved vaccines by Health Canada. In a press release issued a year ago, the pharmaceutical company concluded phase three of its study. According the company’s research, two doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has a 95 per cent efficacy rate in fighting the deadly virus.

	The Moderna vaccine is another one approved by Health Canada. On Health Canada’s website it says clinical trials showed that 2 doses of the Moderna vaccine is 94.1 per cent effective in protecting those aged 18 and above against COVID-19. And 100 per cent effective for those 12 to 17 years-old.

	Health Canada also tracks reported side effects and says that about 4 people out of every 10,000 people vaccinated have reported one or more adverse side effect in Canada. The current tally is 22,231 Canadians. Of that, 16,578 are considered non-serious. While 5,663 are considered serious. 539 people to-date have experienced a serious adverse event that include a severe allergic reaction.

	Despite that, Ruddy remains steadfast in her views about the COVID-19 vaccine.

	“This hasn’t been an easy choice for me at all. I’m terrified. But I’m also terrified of the reactions that you could get from this vaccine.”

	The single mom of two says she loves her job very much, and is now preparing for the fact that she may not have it for much longer.

	“This is serious for all the people that are off right now.”

	“I have nothing against anyone who chose what they chose,” she said. “I chose to not get vaccinated and that was my choice. And I shouldn’t be scrutinized and I shouldn’t lose my livelihood and my job because of what I chose for myself and neither should anybody else.”

	In a news release announcing the mandate on Sept. 1, the president and chief executive officer of Grand River Hospital said the move was meant to help keep the community safe.

	“The COVID-19 vaccine is a vital measure of protection, particularly as more services continue to open up, and community spread continues to increase,” said Ron Gagnon. “As a health care organization, we have a responsibility to safeguard and protect the health and wellness of those we work with, and those we care for.”

	The president of St. Mary’s General Hospital and the hospital lead for the COVID response echoed that in the same release, and said protecting the health and safety of patients and staff was the priority.

	“Vaccines are an important tool in the COVID fight and in our response to the highly transmissible Delta variant—something that we have witnessed the impact of first-hand,” said Lee Fairclough. “It is our responsibility to implement every safety measure possible to protect our patients and teams.”

Unvaccinated health-care workers to get priority for Johnson & Johnson vaccines arriving in B.C. next week,"Nov. 10, 2021 11:01 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Health-care workers will be given first priority for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which B.C. health officials say is expected to arrive by next week.

	In a COVID-19 briefing on Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the supply of the J&J vaccines will be limited.

	“It will be available first for any health-care worker who wants to use this as their way of getting back to work.”  B.C. adds 497 cases as Canada approves 1st COVID-19 vaccine for kidsFull coverage at CTVNews.ca/CoronavirusIs B.C. flooding affecting the province's COVID-19 numbers?

	B.C.’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health-care workers means that anyone who isn’t fully vaccinated against the virus is currently on unpaid leave. But, Henry says there are health-care workers who are still unvaccinated but have been waiting for the J&J vaccine to get immunized.

	“Some health care workers have said that this is the only option they will consider right now,” Henry said. “Our first priority will be offering it to health-care workers.”

	WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THE J&J VACCINE

	The J&J vaccine is considered a more traditional vaccine as it uses virus-based technology, as opposed to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which use mRNA.

	While the first couple of weeks administering the J&J vaccine will prioritize those in health care, Henry says there will be some available for others later on.

	“There have been a lot of people who've reached out to me asking for the J&J vaccine,” she said. “We will have some available and we will be providing you with the details next week of how you can access this through a central call-in number.”

	Among health-care workers, 97 per cent have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and are considered fully vaccinated, according to Dix.

	Two per cent haven't had any shots, and the remaining one per cent have just the first dose.

	The incoming J&J vaccine is different from other vaccines currently available in B.C. because a person is considered fully vaccinated after just one dose.

	“It's been widely used in the U.S. as a single dose vaccine. And it has good, strong protection … the same as the two doses of AstraZeneca,” Henry said.

	Henry said the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has recently received approval from the U.S. CDC for the vaccine to be given as a booster shot six months after a person receives their primary dose. But, she noted, the company has not yet applied for approval of boosters in Canada. 

	HEALTH CANADA UPDATES SIDE EFFECTS

	Common side effects from the J&J vaccine are temporary and can last a few hours to a few days, according to Health Canada’s web page on the vaccine. 

	“This is the body's natural response, as it's working hard to build protection against the disease,” reads the Health Canada website.

	These side effects may include redness, soreness, swelling, chills, fatigue, joint pain, headache, muscle aches or a mild fever.

	On Nov. 9, Health Canada said it’s updating the labels on the J&J vaccines (also known as the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine) to include warnings of very rare side effects.

	The move provides “additional information about the very rare risk of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune condition, and the rare risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following vaccination,” reads a statement from the national health agency.

	As the vaccine is still new in Canada, the agency is also providing information on what kind of side effects to watch out for. Health Canada says to seek medical attention if, after receiving the J&J vaccine, you have unexplained bleeding or bruising, small purplish spots beyond the site of vaccination, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain or swelling, or persistent abdominal pain.

	Other rare side effects, for which people should also seek prompt medical attention, include swelling of the lips and mouth, itchy hives, sudden low blood pressure, vomiting and diarrhea or loss of consciousness.

	But, Health Canada urges that people not be deterred, because the vaccine is approved for use in Canada and is overall safe and effective against the coronavirus.

	“Our decisions are based only on scientific and medical evidence showing that vaccines are safe and effective. The benefits must also outweigh any risks,” reads the website.

"University of Sask. student’s religion won’t allow for COVID-19 vaccine, leads to eviction from campus residence","Nov. 10, 2021 7:48 a.m. CST","
     
     SASKATOON - 
     
    
	Third-year University of Saskatchewan student Jimmy Ding, originally from China, has lived in Canada since 2014, and has been staying at St. Andrew’s College while pursuing a degree in geological engineering.

	He said his religion, which he prefers not to disclose, doesn’t allow him to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and this has resulted in him being evicted from his campus residence. 

	""I just practice what my religion script tells me to do,"" Ding said, adding he’s providing proof of negative tests to the college. “Because my vaccination status, and they try to evict me. I feel it’s not very appropriate.""

	""When the pandemic just started, and there were a lot of people they had some confusion that 'Oh, Chinese people they have a virus and they are dangerous,' it's not true.""

	Principal of St. Andrew’s College Richard Manley-Tannis said the living space at the college is communal with a shared kitchen and shared bathrooms, and because of the building’s age, it has no ventilation system.

	""It became clear that a significant amount of the current residents were not comfortable with having somebody unvaccinated, even with rapid testing in place, and owing to the context of the building,"" he said.

	Ding claims other residents at the college were only told that he wouldn’t receive the vaccine, and not the reason why he wouldn’t.

	""This is distorted information, to try to justify their discrimination,"" he said.

	Manley-Tannis explained it was not an easy decision to make, but it was about the safety of others and not a person’s race or religion. Ultimately, he said there wasn’t the physical space available to quarantine someone should they test positive for COVID-19.

	""In this COVID-world, the community's safety takes precedent,"" he said. ""It's very clear that educational institutions are exempt from eviction expectations, and likely for reasons exactly like that—because of the nature of our communal living context. We can't accommodate the way that we would like to.""

	""And let's be very clear, if St. Andrew’s had the physical capacity to offer this resident a space that honoured his request for religious accommodation, we would provide that.""

	Manley-Tannis said Ding must be out of the college before Nov. 19.

	Human rights commission response

	Ding said he’s been in contact with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission (SHRC) about his eviction. 

	""It says duty for the service provider to provide the accommodation for people who cannot give a proof of vaccine,"" he said. ""In order to balance this consideration and the safety issue, the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission said negative COVID tests could be (an) alternative to solve this issue and balance both sides.""

	""I have the freedom of practice, of religious practice.""

	In a statement to CTV News, SHRC said some people may not be able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine due to a reason protected by the code.

	""However, these cases are rare and must be supported by evidence. Objection to vaccination based on personal preference is not protected by the code,"" SHRC said. 

	""Employers and service providers have a duty to reasonably accommodate individuals who cannot receive the vaccine due to a reason protected by the code, to the point of undue hardship.

	Accommodation does not have to be perfect nor does it have to be the individual’s preferred accommodation, but it must be reasonable. Reasonable accommodation will differ on a case-by-case basis,” SHRC said. 

	Finding another place to live

	Ding said the eviction letter on his record makes it harder for him to find a new place to live, and the process has been stressful as the weather gets colder.

	""I probably will live on the street, or I talk to my friend or if they could give me a place,"" Ding said. ""I have no clue, I really have no clue.""

	""I just wish people could be nice to a refugee.""

	Manley-Tannis said St. Andrew's College and the U of S have shared resources for alternative accommodations with Ding.

	""I am well aware that there is actually space or alternative space within the city,"" Manley-Tannis said.

	""I also understand that the University of Saskatchewan has reached out or is intending to reach out to explore on campus facilities that have that quarantine capacity or a room that has its own bathroom and a room that has its own kitchen, which the college does not and is not able to provide.""

	In a statement from Jay Wilson, interim vice-provost teaching, learning, and student experience with the university, said he would not provide specifics on individual situations for privacy reasons, but said ""students living in any USask residences are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with having received two doses of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine a minimum of 14 days prior to moving in.""

	Uof S vaccination policy

	The university’s current COVID-19 policy requires anyone who’s accessing the campus to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test, and it will be changing to proof of double vaccination as the only way to access campus starting Jan. 4, 2022.

	Wilson said the university ""will continue to consider accommodation requests for these individuals in accordance with the requirements of the code. Only those with an approved accommodation, as appropriate and in limited circumstance, will be allowed on campus without being fully vaccinated.""

	Ding said he’s spoken with U of S president Peter Stoicheff, and under grounds protected by the Human Rights Code, will continue to provide negative COVID-19 test results to attend classes at the university in person passed Jan. 4.

	Manley-Tannis said St. Andrew’s College is an affiliated college and is completely autonomous, so it can operate under different guidelines, and providing a negative test isn’t enough to continue to live there.

	""If anything has become clear, it’s that rapid testing actually isn't 100% (effective). Rapid testing is a moment in time that doesn't actually tell you whether or not, as I understand the science, whether or not you're able to spread it at that stage,"" he said.

	""It's whether you're asymptomatic or symptomatic. And so rapid testing is helpful, but in a communal nature by the time that rapid test ends up displaying that you are positive you could have already been basically a carrier, and though asymptomatic, spreading the virus in a communal nature.""

	Ding argues since everyone else in the living space has been vaccinated they should be protected from infection, and encourages doctors and physicians to investigate other forms of immunity.

	""There are certain groups of people, they practice their religion, they’re doing meditation to improve their immune system,"" he said. ""Some people, based on their worldview have their method, some people they will take other methods.""

'Extorting and intimidating': Victoria business targeted after comparing anti-vaxxers to drunk drivers,"Nov. 10, 2021 5:56 a.m. CST","

	A Victoria business owner says his company has come under a ""sustained and coordinated attack"" by people opposed to COVID-19 vaccine mandates after the business barred anti-vaxxers from its premises, comparing them to drunk drivers.

	The owner of Victoria Escape Games says a ""vigilante mob"" has been targeting the business with negative online reviews in the wake of the management's request that those opposed to vaccines avoid the business.

	Victoria Escape Games says children under 12 and those with a medical exemption from being vaccinated are welcome at the business.

	""For those who have followed the science and been vaccinated, please rest assured that Victoria Escape Games remains a safe place for you, and an unwelcoming place for those who spread ignorance and disease to the communal detriment of all,"" the management said in a statement on the company's website.

	The message prompted a coordinated backlash among anti-vaxxers, with dozens of negative reviews popping up on Google within the past two days.

	""I got the first clue this was starting yesterday morning,"" owner Derek Madson told CTV News on Tuesday. ""It was a deluge. This is not just Google. It’s everything – many voicemails, text messages, emails.""

	Madson said the anti-vaccine group was organized on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app, and boasts more than 500 members. ""These groups are literally extorting and intimidating,"" Madson said.

	Many of the negative Google reviews took issue with the business owner's comparison of anti-vaxxers to drunk drivers. Madson maintains the analogy is appropriate.

	""The threat to life and health of anti-vaxx rhetoric is equivalent to drunk driving,"" Madson said, adding he believes a group like Mothers Against Drunk Driving should organize to combat the dangers of anti-vaccine beliefs.

	""Anti-vaxxers put themselves at risk but they also put everyone else around them at risk,"" Madson said. ""My argument from the beginning is that we start treating anti-vaxxers the same we treat drunk drivers.""

	The business owner said he has been in touch with Google about removing the recent reviews but it appears to be a losing battle.

	""They're organized, they're sustained,"" he said. ""Many of these people have said they're going to drive me out of business. That’s their goal.""

	Alberta reported 422 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday as the number of active cases in the province decreased.

	There are 608 people hospitalized with the disease, 128 of whom are in intensive care, according to the province’s chief medical officer of health.

	""While we are headed in the right direction, I want to be clear that this is still a significant number of people in hospital, taxing our healthcare system,” said Dr. Deena Hinshaw.

	“We must all continue to support efforts to bring these numbers down even further.”

	Eight Albertans were reported to have died due to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, according to Hinshaw. She added that after a review, four deaths that had previously been attributed to COVID-19 were deemed to have not been caused by the disease.

	There are active alerts or outbreaks in 211 Alberta schools, and 10 had 10 or more people with COVID-19 who were in the building, according to Hinshaw.

	On Monday, Albertans will need their vaccination QR code or a negative test to enter businesses taking part in the Restrictions Exemption Program, Hinshaw added. Paper copies of vaccine records will not be accepted as of Nov. 15.

	
		Here's how Albertans can get their COVID-19 vaccine QR code


	First Nations and military vaccination records will still be accepted.

	Of Alberta’s eligible population, 87.6 per cent have received a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 81.4 are fully vaccinated.

	

			A Flourish chart


	“In Alberta, the odds of being hospitalized with COVID-19 are approximately eight times higher if you’re only partially vaccinated and 10 times higher if you’re unvaccinated,” said Hinshaw.

	BOOSTER SHOTS

	Health Canada approved booster doses for the Pfizer vaccine for people 18 and older, which Hinshaw called “encouraging.”

	
		Canada authorizes Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster for adults


	Albertans who are deemed to have an increased risk of breakthrough COVID-19 infections are already eligible for boosters. Hinshaw said there is no specific timeline for when the general public would be able to get a third dose of vaccine.

	All Albertans living in continuing care facilities have had the opportunity to get a third dose of vaccine, added Hinshaw.

	NEW TREATMENT FOR COVID-19

	Hinshaw also announced a “new tool to help prevent severe outcomes for those at the highest risk.”

	Alberta Health Services began administering sotrovimab to patients at home who are 65 and older, have COVID-19, are unvaccinated and have consented to receive it.

	“Sotrovimab is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that attaches to the spike protein of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19, and prevents the virus from entering and infecting healthy cells within your body,” according to the government of Canada website.

	The use of sotrovimab was authorized by Health Canada in July.

	It is intended to be used to treat people with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms.

	“The treatment is being rolled out across the province in a phased approach, starting with those with the highest risk of severe outcomes, like hospitalization,” said Hinshaw.

	“Let me stress that sotrovimab is not a replacement for COVID-19 vaccines… as vaccines are the most effective method to prevent serious outcomes from the disease.”

	In the update, Hinshaw also addressed “misinformation”, including a “rumor” that COVID-19 vaccines cause miscarriages.

	
		No, COVID-19 vaccines do not cause miscarriages


	“I want to assure Albertans that we continue to look at safety, including this particular question, in detail,” said Hinshaw. “There is no evidence that miscarriages or stillbirths have increased after COVID-19 vaccines have been made available.

	“In fact, evidence shows that there has been a slight, but steady, reduction in the number of miscarriages in Alberta, starting in 2019, prior to the COVID pandemic, and this has continued over the following two years.”

	Hinshaw also addressed concern over reports of a potential new variant in western Canada, which she called a sub lineage of the Delta variant.

	“It is not a different variant of concern, there’s no evidence that it causes more severe illness, that it evades vaccine protection, that it’s significantly different from the Delta variant that’s been circulating as the dominant strain in Alberta since late summer,” said Hinshaw.

	“We know that when viruses replicate, they can change their genetic slightly, so sometimes you have these sub lineages that evolve, but that doesn’t mean the behave differently from that parent strain and that’s the case with this particularly sub lineage.”

'It could mean a change of employment': Deadline approaching for COVID-19 vaccinations at local hospitals ,"Nov. 9, 2021 7:38 a.m. CST","
     
     KITCHENER - 
     
    
	Time is running out for hospital staff in Waterloo Region who have yet to be fully vaccinated.

	Starting Nov. 9, local hospitals will be enforcing its double-vaccination policy, which will require anyone entering its facilities to show proof of a second dose along with a piece of government photo ID.

	“We're making the choice based on doing all that we can,” said Lee Fairclough, the president of St. Mary’s General Hospital and the regional hospital lead for the pandemic response.

	Fairclough said at St. Mary’s, more than 99 per cent of staff are now fully vaccinated or have one dose with a signed attestation that they will get their second as soon as they become eligible.

	“For those staff who have not complied with the policy, it could mean a change of employment status with us,” said Fairclough. “Close to 1,600 staff and close to 400 physicians [have been vaccinated] so it’s a very small number of staff impacted.”

	As of October, 27 staff members at St. Mary’s were unvaccinated and placed on unpaid leave. At Grand River Hospital, 171 staff were unvaccinated and Cambridge Memorial, 51 staff had chosen not to comply with the policy.

	Though the province is not mandating hospital workers get vaccinated, hospitals in Waterloo Region want to assure the community that they are taking every level of precaution for staff, patients and visitors.

	“The policy does have some exceptions like a confirmed medical exemption... for end of life and compassionate needs for patients, we will continue to accommodate those. Some people will come in with full PPE,” said Fairclough.

	While she does not anticipate any significant staffing shortages due to the vaccine mandate, the president of SEIU healthcare, Sharleen Stewart said while most of the union’s members are in support of the policy, hospitals are still losing staff.

	“Twenty times are leaving because of the working conditions and the lack of respect and protection they are receiving out of this pandemic,” said Stewart.

	She adds hospitals across Ontario can’t afford to lose any number of staff.

	“If people don’t show up, it’s going to have an effect on the services the hospital provides,” said Stewart.

Ski hills and small business demand the removal of molecular testing requirements to spawn winter tourism ,"Nov. 9, 2021 9:57 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
     Alberta’s local ski hill operators are calling for changes to requirements that all visitors to Canada must undergo a molecular COVID-19 test 72 hours before their arrival.  Officials say this is deterring people from travelling to Canada, on the same day the United States reopened its land border to non-essential travel from Canada, for fully vaccinated Canadians.  “If the costs are $100 on either side of the border, it’s potentially a compelling reason for someone not to go,” said Pete Woods, president of the SkiBig3 in Banff.  SkiBig3 represent Lake Louise, Mount Norquay and Sunshine Village.  Currently, anyone aged four or older must take a molecular test, such as a PCR at their own cost, before coming to Canada, despite your vaccination status. Some tests can cost up to $200.  Woods believes with these added costs for a winter vacation, there could be a devastating impact on the industry, with hills opening last week.  “I think that is coupled with (the fact) that we’re just not seeing a lot of non-stop flights into Calgary,” he said.  He believes that could change if the government scrapped the requirement for the negative test result.  “These are linked. If we see the PCR test alleviated with this border opening then we will see air seats come back into Calgary and other key markets.”  Currently, anyone aged four or older must take a molecular test, such as a PCR at their own cost, before coming to Canada, despite your vaccination status. Some tests can cost up to $200.  BORDER OPENING  Monday marked the first time travellers could travel freely across the land border into the USA for nearly 21 months.  The tourism industry of Canada said it is hearing from small business that the test is wasting time and money as governments try to get the tourism sector back on its feet after more than 20 months of pandemic policies.  “It’s going to hold back a lot of Americans coming across the border,” said CEO Beth Potter.  “We’ve already seen that since August,"" she added. ""The numbers coming across the border have not been what we had hoped to see.”  Canada began allowing visitors from the U.S. with full vaccine status and a negative test in August.  But health experts warn that testing will probably be in place for quite some time.  “Although it’s maybe inconvenient, because people have to get tested, it’s for our own good,” said developmental biologist Gosia Gasperowicz from the University of Calgary.  “The third wave was mostly done by (the) Alpha variant, the UK variant. It was a variant that was not formed here, it was imported here and it caused a huge outbreak and wave that cost many lives. The fourth wave was (the) Delta variant, so again it was something that came from abroad.”  Gasperowicz said the only way testing should be taken out of requirements is if COVID-19 is completely eradicated.  She said vaccine coverage wanes over time, creating a higher risk to be re-infected and  serious consequences to your health.  NO PLANS TO CHANGE: HEALTH CANADA  Health Canada says it has no plans to change the testing requirements for visitors anytime soon.  “These border testing measures are a critical part of Canada’s COVID-19 surveillance strategy,” read a statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada.  “A pre-arrival molecular test is required in order to reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the importation of cases, the risks of transmission in transit, and risks to Canada’s domestic health care system.”  PHAC says antigen tests are not allowed, but officials are looking at whether or not to accept them in the future.  “As more evidence becomes available, and as the epidemiological situation improves in Canada and internationally, the Government of Canada will make appropriate and cautious adjustments to public health measures including border measures, with the first and foremost priority being the health and safety of Canadians,” read the statement.

Pop-up clinic for COVID-19 boosters held in Leamington ,"Nov. 9, 2021 8:26 a.m. CST","
     
     Windsor, Ont.  - 
     
    
	Expanded eligibility for the booster came into effect over the weekend.

	Over the past 24-72 hours, admission rates at Erie Shores HealthCare have risen and health official says booster shots couldn’t have come at a better time.

	“I’m here getting my booster shot. My third dose of the Pfizer vaccine,” says emergency medicine physician, Dr. Christopher Anderson.

       'Pretty significant response': WECHU says COVID-19 booster appointments filling upWECHU ready to ramp up administering COVID-19 booster shots

	Anderson took advantage of a pop-up booster shot clinic held in Leamington today.

	“It’s been almost a year since I’ve had my second shot and so I was due for my third shot. I’m just excited to get my third dose,” says Anderson.

	“We’ve been waiting for this moment, it’s been a long 20 months. We’re excited to be out in the community having access to boosters in the county today,” says Kristin Kennedy, president and CEO of Erie Shores HealthCare.

	In Essex County, the Community Response and Stabilization Team (CRST), a collaboration between Erie Shores HealthCare and Essex-Windsor EMS, are providing booster shots to eligible residents.

	To be eligible, you had to have had your second dose at least six months ago and fall under one of the following categories:

	“It is for the 70-plus population, those who have had two doses of Astra Zeneca, our healthcare workers, caregivers for those that are in long-term care as well as our indigenous,” says Kennedy. 

	Many are eager to roll up their sleeve for their third dose.

	“I kind of jumped on the opportunity when I saw cases are rising in Michigan as well and I have family there. I want to do everything I can to protect my friends and family,” says Erie Shores Healthcare registered nurse, Ciara Aucoin.

	“Being in healthcare, I see it every day so just for my own protection I feel that I need it - to do what I’m doing every day,” says Anderson.

	“I can’t wait to get my third shot,” says Leamington resident Bill Campbell.

	But some like Bill and Sandi Campbell couldn’t get their third jab today.

	“We have to wait another three weeks because it’s only been five months and one week,” says Campbell.

	Kristin Kennedy, president and CEO of Erie Shores Healthcare encourages all who are eligible to get their shot as vaccine rates in Leamington are low.

	“Erie Shores Healthcare is seeing admission rates increase related to COVID and the unvaccinated so we really want to provide access to those first and second doses so please come out, appointments are not required,” says Kennedy.

	There are more pop up clinics planned for both Leamington and Windsor.

'My question is why': Patients speak out about New Westminster pharmacy facing lawsuit over reused syringe allegations,"Nov. 8, 2021 4:18 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Two patients of a New Westminster pharmacy that is facing legal action over allegations involving reused syringe barrels for COVID-19 shots are speaking out about their experience.

	Tatiana Feka and Ray Roshan said they both went to get their second COVID-19 vaccine at Kent Pharmacy on Columbia Street on Aug. 26.

	Feka told CTV News Vancouver she found the pharmacy listed online as a place to get a COVID-19 vaccine, and chose to go there because it was the closest one.

	“You think that because it’s on a government website, you know, it’s trusted,” she said, adding that she struggles with a phobia of needles.

	“I’ve just always been paranoid of needles, so for me to go get a shot, it’s a big deal.”

	Her first experience with COVID-19 vaccination was at a large, health-authority-run clinic that used to be at the Anvil Centre community centre, and she said that went smoothly.

	Feka said after getting her shot at the pharmacy, another woman who appeared to be next in line suddenly spoke up.

	“She said, ‘No, I’m not getting my shot,’” Feka recalled. “She goes, ‘I’m not doing this here.’ She goes, ‘I saw what you did. You’re supposed to take everything brand new and throw it away and use brand new. You didn’t do that.’”

	Feka shared video she said was taken by the woman inside the pharmacy, which showed Feka sitting and waiting in a chair, and what appeared to be someone preparing a syringe behind her at a counter.

	“The girl said, ‘I videotaped you,’ and then he ran over and tried to tell her to delete the video,” Feka said. “We were just sitting there in shock.”

	Ray Roshan, who received his second COVID-19 vaccine at the pharmacy the same day as Feka, said he also witnessed the exchange.

	“I went over, I said, ‘Hey, she’s a concerned citizen,’” he said. “If you want to fight, fight with me.”

	Feka said police ended up being called.

	“He confessed right in front of us that he made a mistake,” she said. “He said he was rinsing out the barrels with saline.”   

	The pharmacy, its owner Fabina Kara, and former pharmacy manager Bhanu Prasad Seelaboyina are all named as defendants in the proposed class action suit, which alleges people who were vaccinated from Aug. 24 to 26 were potentially put at risk of contracting blood-borne illnesses such as HIV and Hepatitis C because syringe barrels were reused. None of the allegations have been tested in court.

	Feka made a complaint to the College of Pharmacists of B.C., which is now investigating. The college says until that’s complete, Seelaboyina is not able to act as a pharmacy manager or administer injections.

	The pharmacy owner confirmed to CTV News that Seelaboyina is no longer working there.

	Both Roshan and Feka have since received letters from the Fraser Health Authority recommending they go for blood testing over the next three months “out of an abundance of caution.”

	“People can be at risk of getting Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV from reuse of injection equipment,” one of the letters said. “The risk of getting these diseases from a reused syringe is low.”

	Roshan said he suffered from anxiety following his experience.

	“I couldn’t sleep for 10 straight days, I swear,” he said. “It shouldn’t be happening in Canada.”

	Both Feka and Roshan said they were later offered gift cards by the pharmacy and the pharmacy manager, which the owner did not deny. 

	Feka has also reached out to the lawyer for the proposed class action suit.

	“My question is why,” she said. “And I’m still trying to understand why.”

	CTV News spoke to the pharmacy owner by phone. She declined an on-camera interview, saying she wanted to consult legal counsel.

	Feka and Roshan also want to know how pharmacies giving vaccinations are monitored for safe practices.

	“We want people to know that things have to change,” Feka said.

"‘We have about 1,100 slots available’: Cambridge Pinebush clinic ready as COVID-19 booster eligibility expands","Nov. 7, 2021 7:57 a.m. CST","
     
     Cambridge - 
     
    
	More Ontarians are now eligible to receive a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

	Saturday marked the first day of the province’s expanded booster shot eligibility but, at the Pinebush Mass Vaccination Clinic in Cambridge, appointments could be booked as early as Wednesday.

	“We have about 1,100 slots available a day that people can book,” Liam Robinson, the clinic supervisor, told CTV News in an interview.

	The earlier booking times in Waterloo Region are a function of the local appointment system and its independence from the provincial system.

	Province-wide, the list of eligible residents for a booster shot includes:

	
		Anyone aged 70 and older
	
		Health-care workers and essential caregivers
	
		First Nations, Inuit and Metis adults and their non-indigenous household members
	
		People who received two doses of AstraZeneza or one dose of the Janssen vaccine


	Robinson believes eligible residents may have thought they had to wait until Saturday to reserve a time to get their booster.

	“We have about 360 appointments booked [Saturday],” Robinson said. “Most people heard the provincial announcement and thought [Saturday] was only the first day they were eligible in the region.”

	Bookings are required to get a third shot at the Pinebush clinic but appointments can be processed outside the clinic before going inside to be immunized.

	“I was surprised I could get my shot so early,” said Tracy Kirchner, a healthcare worker who received her third shot of vaccine on Saturday. “I thought I would have to wait a couple of days or weeks but I think it was Thursday or Friday I booked it and I was here today.”

	Officials say all third shots will be an mRNA vaccine and the Pinebush clinic says either Pfizer or Moderna can be administered.

	Eligible residents can book an appointment on the Region of Waterloo website.

"Lack of vaccine mandate at B.C.'s Whistler ski resort concerns local doctor, residents","Nov. 8, 2021 12:49 a.m. CST","
     
     Whistler, B.C. - 
     
    
	With cooler weather on the way, and snow already falling in the mountains, skiers and snowboarders are looking forward to the upcoming season — but some say they won’t be hitting the slopes at British Columbia’s most famous resort.

	Chief among their concerns is that many of the resort’s ski lifts are enclosed gondolas that are often tightly packed.

	“There is no other place that we are shoulder to shoulder, leg to leg, breath to breath, with other people in such a closed air space,” said Cathy Zeglinski, a Whistler resident and medical doctor.  B.C. adds 497 cases as Canada approves 1st COVID-19 vaccine for kidsFull coverage at CTVNews.ca/CoronavirusIs B.C. flooding affecting the province's COVID-19 numbers?

	She’s concerned about riding the gondolas at Whistler Blackcomb because the company will not be requiring proof-of-vaccination for guests this season.

	Vail Resorts, which operates Whistler Blackcomb, notes masks are mandatory on lifts and gondolas.

	“We will continue to monitor and follow all local and provincial public health orders,” the company said in a statement to CTV News Vancouver.

	Long-time Whistler resident John Konig doesn’t think that’s good enough.

	He usually skis 80 to 90 days per year but only went twice last season because of concerns about COVID-19.

	This year, he doesn’t know if he’ll go at all.

	“I’m 69 years old. My vaccine (immunity) will be waning this winter. It’ll be six months once we start skiing. So, I think a lot of people have concerns,” he said.

	Konig started a petition hoping to get the company to reverse course.

	It has garnered nearly 9,000 signatures.

	Whistler Blackcomb had to close early last year, as the resort municipality became one of BC’s COVID-19 hotspots, prompting the province to offer immunization to all adults in the community very early in the vaccine rollout.

	“People here were so excited to get vaccinated because they all want to get back to normal,” said Zeglinski.

	Meanwhile, Grouse Mountain, a much smaller ski hill close to Metro Vancouver, will require all guests to be fully vaccinated for the upcoming ski season.

	In Whistler, given the limited number of open-air lifts and ubiquity of enclosed gondolas, Zeglinski said she can’t understand why the company operating the slopes doesn’t follow Grouse Mountain’s lead.

	“Any of us that have skied know that you don’t spend five minutes on a gondola,” she said. “You spend, 20, 30, 40. Lifts break down. You may spend an hour.”

	Whistler Blackcomb plans to open for the season on Nov. 25, but unless the company updates it’s vaccine policy, neither Konig or Zeglinski will be lining up.

     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Alberta's unemployment rate dropped enough last month to bring the province close to its pre-pandemic rate.

	According to Statistics Canada’s October 2021 Labour Force Survey, Alberta had a jobless rate of 7.6 per cent last month, down five-tenths of a percentage point from September (8.1) and only slightly higher than the 7.5 per cent recorded in February 2020 before COVID-19 hit.

	The survey, released on Friday, reflects labour market conditions the week of Oct. 10 to 16, three weeks after the introduction of the Alberta's Restrictions Exception Program (REP), a vaccine passport.

       Alberta's unemployment rate climbs to 8.1% in SeptemberCanadian economy added 31,000 jobs in October, unemployment rate hits pandemic-era low

	At the time ofthe survey, people were only required to have one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine to enter businesses that had opted in to the program. On Oct. 22, that requirement increased to only allow fully vaccinated patrons.

	Alberta's October 2021 jobless rate is significantly lower than it was last year, when it sat at 10.7 per cent.

	 ""October’s job numbers show that Alberta’s economic recovery continues, with an increase of 9,000 new full-time jobs. While, unfortunately, part-time employment decreased, our unemployment rate fell once again and is now lower than any point during the pandemic,"" Minister of Jobs Doug Schweitzer said in a statement.

	The NDP, however, took aim at Alberta's United Conservative Party, saying recovery is still very fragile.

	""The Premier and his UCP government keep telling Albertans that everything is fine, but these figures tell a different story,"" energy critic Kathleen Ganley said in a statement. ""Albertans are already struggling to pay their bills and now they’re facing job loss under the UCP government.""

	""While other provinces have fully recovered job losses from the pandemic, Alberta lags behind due to the UCP’s mishandling of COVID-19 that has made our economic crisis deeper and will prolong our recovery,"" economic development and innovation critic Deron Bilous said.

	""While the premier was on vacation, our province was sent into a deadly fourth wave that had devastating effects on our economy. Albertans deserve answers on why the premier let this happen.""

	Though both Calgary and Edmonton saw unemployment drop in October, their rates remained among the highest of the 34 metropolitan areas surveyed.

	In Calgary, unemployment continued to drop significantly, sitting at 8.0 per cent in October compared to 8.9 per cent the month prior.

	“We are seeing some promising signs of economic growth in Calgary with a second straight month of strong improvements in the job market,"" Dexter Lam from Calgary Economic Development said in a statement.

	""Many cities in Canada saw people leaving their labour forces, but a significant number of Calgarians started seeking work in October, and still more Calgarians found jobs.""

	Edmonton's unemployment rate dropped two-tenths of a percentage point in September to sit at 8.0 per cent.

	Only Toronto and Windsor, Ont. saw higher jobless rates at 8.4 per cent and 9.2 per cent respectively.

	 Public Health says it is closely monitoring all four health zones for community spread.

	N.S. TO OFFER BOOSTER DOSES BY END OF NOVEMBER

	Nova Scotia plans to begin administering COVID-19 booster doses to more eligible groups by the end of this month.

	During Friday’s news update, Strang announced that the province will accept all five recommendations announced by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) on Oct. 29.

	Those recommendations include offering boosters to people with a higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness or decreased protection since vaccination.

	“As we prepare to offer booster doses, our first priority will continue to be encouraging people who have one or no doses of COVID vaccine to get vaccinated,” said Strang. “Boosters may provide an added level of protection, but the best way to reduce the spread of the virus is to ensure that everyone has at least two doses of vaccine.”

	Groups who will now be eligible for a booster dose in Nova Scotia include:

	
		anyone 80 and older, followed by anyone ages 70 to 79
	
		adult frontline healthcare workers who were double vaccinated with an interval of less than 28 days between their first and second doses
	
		people who received two doses of the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD vaccine or one dose of Janssen vaccine


	The province says they are also engaging with Indigenous and African Nova Scotian communities on the best way to offer booster doses in those communities.

	Nova Scotia has previously made booster doses available for moderately to severely immunocompromised people, people living in long-term care and people who are required to travel for work to a country that does not recognize a mixed vaccine series.

	NACI recommends that booster doses be offered at least six months after the primary series is completed.

	The province says planning for the booster doses is underway, and updates to the vaccine booking system are being made. More information will be announced once booking for booster doses opens.

	NACI also recommended last month that the optimal interval between first and second doses is eight weeks. Nova Scotians can still schedule their second dose as early as 28 days after the first but are encouraged to follow the NACI recommendation and wait eight weeks for their second dose.

	EXPOSURE NOTICE FOR TWO SCHOOLS

	Health officials also sent exposure notices for two schools in the province on Thursday.

	The latest school exposures are at Charles P. Allen High in Bedford and Burton Ettinger Elementary in Halifax.

	“It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious,” said N.S. Health in a release.

	A list of schools with exposures is available online.

	COVID-19 CASE DATA

	Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 3,204 tests on Thursday. A total of 1,328,408 COVID-19 tests have been processed since the start of the pandemic.

	There were 28,608 rapid tests administered between Oct. 29 and Nov. 4. This includes 1,488 rapid tests at the pop-up sites in Halifax, Dartmouth, Amherst and Kentville and 27,120 through the workplace screening program. Another 8,661 home rapid tests were distributed at the pop-up sites.

	According to the province's online COVID-19 dashboard, there have been 7,550 cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nova Scotia. Of those, 7,229 people have recovered and 101 have died due to COVID-19.

"COVID-19 'now a preventable disease,' B.C.'s top doctor says","Nov. 5, 2021 10:57 p.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C.'s top doctor is calling COVID-19 ""a preventable disease,"" citing effectiveness of vaccines as the reason.

	In a modelling presentation Thursday, Dr. Bonnie Henry outlined what B.C.'s COVID-19 caseload would be without vaccines. Currently, the reproductive number in the province is at or below one in nearly all regions, meaning each new confirmed infection is spreading, on average, to just one other person, or fewer. 

	Without vaccination, Thursday's modelling presentation suggested the virus' reproductive number would be 3.43, and cases would be growing exponentially, surpassing 8,000 per day in a matter of just a few weeks.

	""This is showing us how important and how protective and effective the vaccines that we have are,"" Henry said. ""This is now a preventable disease, particularly in severe illness, hospitalizations.""

	The modelling data presented Thursday also revealed an updated estimate of how much more likely individuals are to get infected, end up in hospital or die from COVID-19 if they are unvaccinated.

	Adjusted for age, unvaccinated individuals are 10 times more likely to test positive for COVID-19, the data suggested, and 46 times more likely to die from the disease.

	But the risk of hospitalization is even higher.

	""Just to underline the age adjusted number, 50 times more likely to be in hospital if you're unvaccinated. Fifty times,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix said. ""I think it's important to reflect on that.""

	Even with vaccinations, Henry said the biggest risk factor for COVID-19 continues to be age. In fact, the modelling presentation indicated that 46 per cent of the 179 deaths during October were among those who had received two doses of a vaccine.

	""Our seniors and elders continue to be vulnerable and that's why we've rolled out the booster dose to them so quickly,"" Henry said.

	As of Thursday, 90.1 per cent of eligible people aged 12 and older have received their first COVID-19 dose and 85.6 per cent have received two. The province's plan to offer booster shots is continuing to roll out and Dix said that process is nearly complete in long-term care and assisted living homes.

	""Booster-dose vaccination is 98 per cent complete in long-term care and seniors assisted living facilities across the province with 526 of 536 facilities receiving their booster dose to date,"" he said.

	Booster doses are being offered to other groups most vulnerable to the disease first and will be available to the general population through a gradual roll-out starting next year.

B.C. COVID-19 modelling shows what the province's caseload would look like without vaccines,"Nov. 5, 2021 5:54 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C.'s latest modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic shows transmission of the coronavirus flat or declining across the province, with a previous spike in cases among children seemingly over.

	COVID-19's reproductive number is at or below one in all regions of the province, meaning each new confirmed infection is spreading, on average, to just one other person, or fewer.

	That's a recipe for continued declining cases, something health officials attribute to widespread vaccination.  B.C. adds 497 cases as Canada approves 1st COVID-19 vaccine for kidsFull coverage at CTVNews.ca/CoronavirusIs B.C. flooding affecting the province's COVID-19 numbers?

	B.C.'s medium-range projection, however, assumes a reproductive number of 1.07, with cases remaining relatively flat at their current levels, according to the slides presented by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry in a news conference Thursday afternoon.

	Currently, B.C. is seeing just over 500 new cases of COVID-19 per day, down from a high in the mid-700s earlier in the fourth wave.

	Without vaccination, the modelling presentation suggests, the virus' reproductive number would be 3.43, and cases would be growing exponentially, surpassing 8,000 per day in a matter of just a few weeks.

	Both projections are based on the existing rules put in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus. If there were no vaccines, B.C. would almost certainly need stricter regulations to keep the virus in check and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.

	With B.C. headed into what she calls ""respiratory season,"" Henry said the existing rules that have helped the province get its reproductive number down to its current level need to stay in place.

	""We have, right now, a fragile balance,"" the provincial health officer said. ""We're going down slowly … This is not the time to let off, in any way, on the things we are doing to protect ourselves, our families and our communities.""

	Henry listed five things she says B.C. residents should do for their health and that of their community. Four of them relate to vaccination. They are: getting a booster dose when it's your turn; getting your first and second doses right away if you haven't; getting an influenza vaccine to protect against the flu; and registering younger children to get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they're eligible.

	The fifth thing British Columbians should do, according to Henry, is stay home if they are sick and continue to take actions to limit the spread of COVID-19, such as keeping distance, wearing masks and getting tested as soon as possible when symptoms develop.

	Henry described ""stubbornly high rates of hospitalization"" as B.C.'s ""biggest challenge"" over the last couple of months.

	Health Minister Adrian Dix said more than 100 patients have now been relocated from hospitals in B.C.'s north to other areas of the province.

	The province hit a 25-week high for COVID-19-related hospitalizations earlier this week. 

	Henry attributed B.C.'s high number of hospitalizations to a combination of factors, including the highly transmissible Delta variant leading to more serious illness among younger people - particularly those who are unvaccinated - as well as breakthrough cases among older people who are fully vaccinated, but whose immune systems mount a less robust response to immunization than younger people's do.

	For this reason, older people have been prioritized for booster shots, Henry said. 

	Age has always been, and continues to be, the biggest risk factor for COVID-19, the provincial health officer added.

	Many of those who died from COVID-19 in B.C. in the month of October were older people who were fully vaccinated, Henry said. The modelling presentation indicated that 46 per cent of the 179 deaths during the month were among those who had received two doses of a vaccine.

	Forty-nine per cent of the deaths were among unvaccinated people, and those deaths tended to be among people who were younger, on average, than those who were fully vaccinated and died, according to Henry.

	An unvaccinated person is 46 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than a fully vaccinated person of the same age, and 50 times more likely to be hospitalized, Henry said.

	The latest data came after an update from the province on the projected spread of COVID-19. Earlier in the day, the provincial health officer presented modelling data showing transmission of the novel coronavirus is flat or declining across B.C., and suggesting a previous spike in cases among children is over. 

	It's positive news, but B.C. is still dealing with 4,451 active cases as of Thursday's update, 438 of whom are being treated in hospital.

	The province does not provide daily updates on how many hospitalized patients are vaccinated, but officials say the majority of those with infections and in hospital beds are not fully vaccinated, or have received no shots at all.

	As of the latest update, there are 130 people being treated in intensive care units across the province.

	Half of the just-confirmed cases were recorded in Fraser Health – unsurprisingly, as the health authority is the province's most populous. Three of the deaths were also in Fraser Health, while two were in Vancouver Coastal and the remaining three were in the Northern Health region.

	Northern Health is still seeing the most cases per capita.

	Adding two new health-care facility outbreaks to the list, B.C. is now dealing with a total of 37. 

	As of Thursday, 90.1 per cent of eligible people in B.C. had received at least one of their two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and 85.6 per cent have had both shots.

     REGINA - 
     
    
	The Saskatchewan government says the province's fourth wave is waning as COVID-19 cases decline, but health officials say hospitals are still under significant pressure.

	Dr. Saqib Shahab, chief medical health officer, said Tuesday that it will take four to six weeks for hospitals to return to sustainable levels -- and that's only if people remain vigilant by getting vaccinated and reducing gathering sizes.

	""Daily case numbers are coming down and I'm sure we're all hearing a sigh of relief, but we have to remain cautious,"" Shahab said.

       COVID-19 pandemic forces delay of 26K surgeries in Sask. Fewer than 10 patients have used antibody treatment in Sask.5 COVID-19 deaths, 107 new cases reported in Sask. 

	The province reported 107 cases, down from a peak of 650 cases five weeks ago.

	There were 222 people in hospital with the virus, 48 of them receiving intensive care. The province's ICUs remained 123 per cent over baseline capacity.

	The Saskatchewan Health Authority said it's too early to tell if the drop in cases is a trend.

	""(Health-care workers) are tired, they're exhausted, they've been working at a very, very high acuity rate in our ICUs for multiple weeks,"" said Scott Livingstone, the health authority's CEO. ""This type of care is not sustainable.""

	Shahab said there are rural areas where 30 to 40 per cent of eligible populations remain unvaccinated, which is enough to drive more substantive waves of COVID-19.

	""We need to remain extremely vigilant over the winter months,"" he said.

	As a result of the extreme pressure that COVID-19 has put on hospitals, the backlog of those waiting for elective surgery is at 35,000, said Health Minister Paul Merriman.

	Livingstone added it could take 18 months to catch up on hip and knee surgeries alone, not including anyone newly added to the waiting list.

	""We've got a big hill to climb on getting our surgical numbers back to an acceptable level,"" said Merriman.

	He said his ministry has set aside $20 million for surgeries but will need even more money in the coming year to address the backlog.

	The province remains without a plan to expand its surgical capacity, including how it will find additional health-care workers to help with the backlog.

	""We haven't built a plan, approved and staffed (it), because we're still in the middle of the pandemic,"" Livingstone said.

	If people reduced their gathering sizes, the 275 health-care services that have been reduced would be able to resume sooner, he added.

	Merriman said he won't bring in restrictions on gathering sizes because the province's proof of vaccine policy and mask mandate is bringing case numbers down.

	""It is working. Further restrictions right now, I don't think they're warranted,"" Merriman said.

	He later added that the Saskatchewan Party government is doing everything it can to help surgeries resume.

	NDP Opposition Leader Ryan Meili called Merriman an ""incompetent minister that has failed this province drastically.""

	""I don't think this minister has a good sense of how the health-care system works, and I don't believe he is listening fully to key leaders within the health-care system, including Dr. Shahab,"" Meili said.

	New data from the Angus Reid Institute sheds light on the top reasons Canadians aren't rolling up their sleeves for the COVID-19 vaccine.

	Topping the list - personal freedoms and doubt around the severity of the virus.

    Advertisement
    
	Ninety per cent of the unvaccinated surveyed said they believe the health risks of COVID-19 are overstated, while 84 per cent believe their immune system alone is strong enough to fight off the virus.

	The poll also shows that misinformation appears to be playing a role, with 55 percent of unvaccinated people agreeing with the statement: “COVID-19 is a conspiracy that is all about government control.""

	Of the 505 Manitobans polled, 12 per cent are unvaccinated. Of those, 98 per cent say they haven't gotten the jab because they believe COVID-19 is not a serious health threat.

	Another key takeaway – men, particularly those aged 18 to 34, refuse to be vaccinated at a higher rate than women. Twelve per cent said of those surveyed they would not get the vaccine.

	The online survey was conducted between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3 with randomized sample of 5,011 Canadian adults.

	The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit is rolling out COVID-19 booster shots to eligible residents with prioritized groups able to book their third mRNA vaccine starting Wednesday.

	The Ontario government announced Wednesday it is expanding eligibility for booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to additional groups of high-risk individuals starting Nov. 6, 2021, providing an extra layer of protection against the Delta variant. Over the coming months, the province said it is also prepared to gradually roll out booster doses to all Ontarians aged 12 and over.

	Health unit CEO Nicole Dupuis said they are ready since the government asked all public health units in the fall to create a plan for third dose vaccinations.

	“We have a very good plan in Windsor-Essex I believe. We’ve got great partners with our hospitals,” said Dupuis.

	Dupuis said the vaccination clinic at Devonshire Mall will help with increased demand.

	“We’ve continued our mass vaccination site, so that’ll certainly be a big part of our rollout plan. We have a lot of capacity within that clinic, and we feel confident we’re ready to go,” she said.

	The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) expanded eligibility for booster shots last week.

	Based on the recommendation of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and in alignment with NACI’s recent recommendation, the province will begin offering booster doses to the following vulnerable populations if at least six months have passed since their last dose:

	
		Individuals aged 70 and over (born in 1951 or earlier);
	
		Health care workers and designated essential caregivers in congregate settings (including long-term care home and retirement home staff and designated caregivers);
	
		Individuals who received a complete series of a viral vector vaccine (two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine or one dose of the Janssen vaccine); and
	
		First Nation, Inuit and Métis adults and their non-Indigenous household members.
	
		Moore said booster doses are being offered to these groups based on evidence of gradual waning immunity six months after receiving their second dose and a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.


	Dupuis said residents should be familiar with the appointment booking system, since it was also used for the first and second doses.

	“We’ll use our online booking system, as we have in the past,” she said. “Those that have already received a vaccination will be familiar with the process. We do have our booking call centre as well. The number hasn’t changed, and individuals can call if they need greater assistance.”

	WECHU reports 5,218 residents have received a third dose/booster shot of a vaccine to date.

	The Community Response and Stabilization Team (CRST) and Essex-Windsor EMS will start administering booster shots to the following groups of people at least six months after their second dose:

	Age 70+ (Birth year 1951);

	Healthcare workers and designated essential caregivers in congregate settings

	Ontarians who had TWO doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine

	First Nations, Inuit and Métis people and non-Indigenous members of their households

	The CRST will starting providing booster shots to those eligible starting Monday, Nov. 8 at weekly pop-up clinics in West Windsor and Leamington.

		Vancouver Coastal Health – 56 cases, a rate of 4.5 per 100,000 population


	Another 740 people have recovered from COVID-19 as well, according to the ministry, leaving the province's active caseload at 4,373, the lowest it's been since Aug. 13.

	The government announced one new outbreak at Hallmark on the Park, an assisted living facility in Abbotsford. Two others, at Heritage Village and Magnolia Gardens, have ended, leaving the province with 40 active outbreaks across its health-care system.

Nova Scotia gives public-sector workers eight more weeks to get COVID-19 vaccine,"Nov. 4, 2021 9:05 a.m. CST","
     
     HALIFAX - 
     
    
	Nova Scotia is hoping that a little more time is all public sector employees need to adhere to public health's vaccine mandate.

	""This mandate was in no way intended to penalize people so if there are folks who previously hadn't considered vaccination who have gotten the knowledge that they needed in order to do that,"" says Nova Scotia Health Minister Michelle Thompson.

	Now, workers who have their first shot by Nov. 15 will have an extra two months to roll up their sleeves and get their second.

	Nova Scotia's NDP leader supports the extension.

	""There are many, many considerations involved in this whole vaccine related question but when you take all things together this seems to be a prudent course of action,"" says Gary Burrill.

	Those who don't meet the deadline will be placed on unpaid leave.

	Many of them are represented by the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union.

	""What we tend to do is take the issues on a case by case basis and see what the reasons are, the mitigating factors, and really try to piece together a case for our members if they do indeed do have a case,"" says union president Jason MacLean.

	The extension applies to more than 80,000 employees in schools, corrections, child-care centres and hospitals.

	Zach Churchill, the Liberal party's health critic, has some concerns over how the mandate will affect staffing levels.

	""It's really important for the public to know if this policy he's going to exacerbate the labour shortage in our healthcare systems and if that's going to impact service delivery for surgeries, for our emergency departments, for our long-term care sector,"" he said.

	Thompson says her department is working on a contingency plan to deal with the loss of unvaccinated workers.

	The government hasn't released data on how many public sector workers risk being placed on leave for not getting vaccinated.

	In a statement released Monday, Interior Health said the South Similkameen Health Centre in Keremeos is shortening its emergency department hours ""due to limited physician availability.""

	Last week, the vaccine mandate requiring staff to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 came into effect. On Monday, Health Minister Adrian Dix said 3,325 health-care workers remain unvaccinated and are on unpaid leave. Of those, 1,018 are in Interior Health, making up five per cent of that region's staff.

	Neither the health ministry nor the health authority said Keremeos health centre's hour reduction was because of unvaccinated staff, but Dix addressed the community directly while discussing vaccination during a news conference Monday.

	""It's been a challenge in the Interior Health Authority,"" Dix said of vaccine rates, adding that two operating rooms in the entire region had to temporarily close due to shortages.

	""There's some impact on lab times and responses and in communities such as Keremeos where a large percentage of a relatively small group of people in the facility there means that hours are being adjusted … none of this is desirable but it's necessary.""

	The Interior Health Authority says Keremeos residents requiring emergency assistance should call 911.

	They make up 85 per cent of current critical care patients, 67.5 per cent of all hospitalizations from Oct. 15 to 28, and 58.6 per cent of all cases from Oct. 22 to 28, according to the Ministry of Health.'

	

	

	Officials also announced six new health-care facility outbreaks on Monday, at Cascade Gardens, The Cedars, Hallmark on the Lake, Brocklehurst Gemstone Care Centre, Sun Point Village, and Chartwell Malaspina Care Residence.

	The province is now working to contain 39 active outbreaks across the health-care system, the ministry said.

"B.C. residents who got 2 AstraZeneca doses may get booster shot sooner, health officials announce","Nov. 2, 2021 2:50 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C. residents who received two AstraZeneca shots to protect themselves against COVID-19 may receive an invitation to get their booster shot a little earlier than others.

	Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry shared the update during a morning news conference Monday, saying B.C.'s booster-dose program is moving forward. The top doctor announced last week that third doses would be available to the general public starting in the new year.

	Henry said those individuals ""still have very strong, good protection for serious illness,"" but their protection from infection isn't as robust.

	""As a result, people who received two doses of AstraZeneca will be receiving invitations for their booster dose at six months,"" she said. ""This may be sooner than other healthy adults in the community where we know there's very good, strong protection that's lasting well.""

	When Henry announced the booster-dose program, she said invitations will be sent out between six and eight months after a person received their second shot, with the specific timing of that rollout determined by age and level of vulnerability.

	Henry said all booster doses – including for those who got AstraZeneca – will be with an mRNA vaccine.

	""That combination, particularly a viral vector and an mRNA combination has been shown to be very effective and long-lasting,"" she said.

	Last week, Henry presented some local data on the effectiveness of vaccines. Against all infections, including the Delta variant, two doses of AstraZeneca was proving to be 72 per cent effective. By comparison, two doses of Pfizer or a mix of AstraZeneca and an mRNA was 91 per cent effective at preventing infection. Two doses of Moderna had the highest rate at 92 per cent.

	A modified MLHU Section 22 Order that had been in place limiting organized public events and social gatherings has been fully lifted in line with changes to provincial regulations.

	On Wednesday the province lifted capacity limits for outdoor organized public events, though masks must be worn. Limits remain in place for private gatherings indoors (25 people) and outdoors (100 people) and indoor organized public gatherings (25).

	“The Reopening Ontario Act still sets capacity limits for social events and indoor organized gatherings,” said Dr. Alex Summers, MLHU associate medical officer of health in a statement. “These limits continue to be important and will be enforced as we all aim to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.”

	The health unit recommends gatherings be held outdoors as much as possible, with distancing and masking when distancing is not possible.

	B.C. health officials announced 584 new cases of COVID-19 and nine related deaths in their final pandemic update of the week Friday.

	Friday's numbers bring the seven day rolling averages for daily cases and deaths to 575 and 6.71, respectively.

	Ongoing high levels of COVID-19 transmission prompted provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry to extend the province's indoor mask mandate on Friday. 

	Henry's order requiring everyone ages five and older to wear face masks in indoor public spaces had originally been scheduled to end on Oct. 31. 

	There have been no new outbreaks of COVID-19 in health-care facilities in the province, but the Ministry of Health announced a new outbreak at the Vancouver Island Regional Correctional Centre in Saanich.

	The ministry did not say how many cases were associated with the prison outbreak. There are currently 33 ongoing outbreaks in health-care settings across the province.

	Most people contracting COVID-19 and requiring hospitalization in B.C. are unvaccinated. Those who have not been vaccinated accounted for 65.1 per cent of cases over the last week and 73.8 per cent of hospitalizations over the last two, according to the ministry.

	Health Minister Adrian Dix once again tweeted a breakdown of the vaccination status of people in intensive care in the province, saying 86 per cent of those in ICUs were not fully vaccinated. 

	Those who are unvaccinated make up an especially disproportionate number of cases and hospitalizations considering the fact that they represent roughly one-fifth of B.C.'s total population.

	If vaccines did nothing, the unvaccinated would be expected to make up about one-fifth of cases and hospitalizations, in line with their proportion of the population.

	As of Friday, 89.8 per cent of eligible B.C. residents ages 12 and older had received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 85 per cent were fully vaccinated. 

	The largest share of new cases announced Friday was in the Fraser Health region, where 232 new infections were discovered.

	On a per-capita basis, however, Northern Health continues to have the highest case rate. The region added 104 new cases on Friday, equivalent to 34.7 cases per 100,000 residents.

	Fraser Health's much larger population means it added just 12 cases per 100,000.

	Interior Health saw 85 new cases on Friday, Island Health 82 and Vancouver Coastal Health 81.

	Of the new deaths reported Friday, three were in Fraser Health, two were in Vancouver Coastal Health, two were in Northern Health and two were in Island Health.

	The United States land border reopens to fully vaccinated Canadians for non-essential travel on Nov.8, but certain federal quarantine rules will still be in effect for those who are unvaccinated, including children not yet eligible to receive a vaccine.

	Local school boards are working on messaging ahead of the border reopening so that parents can be informed before making travel plans.

    Advertisement
    
	A letter to parents from administrators at one local school reminds parents that “if an unvaccinated student has crossed the border for day-trips, sports, travel, etc., when they return to Canada, regardless if they have received a negative PCR test and have travelled with fully vaccinated parent(s), they fall under the Federal Quarantine and cannot attend school for 14 days.”

	The Greater Essex County District School Board is still working on finalizing messaging. The Windsor-Essex Catholic School Board says they are also working with the health unit to provide information on the updated regulations.

	The WECDSB issued a statement on Friday:

	""We are currently waiting for more detailed instructions from the provincial government regarding any restrictions that may be imposed upon students and school board staff upon their return to Canada if they travel to the United States after the border opens on November 8. In the meantime, we would certainly recommend that parents do their research about current federal regulations before making any travel plans, and closely follow any guidance or restrictions they receive from the Canada Border Services Agency upon their return. We would recommend they use the federal government's COVID-19 travel page for more detailed information: travel.gc.ca/travel-covid""

	Under the federal rules, fully vaccinated students would be able to return to school after returning to Canada with a negative PCR test. Children who are under 12 years old are ineligible to get vaccinated in Canada.

	Toronto-based travel insurance broker Martin Firestone says there is still some uncertainty regarding requirements.

	“It appears that there are just going to be requirements that are going to be necessary and how they’re going to be handled is all up in the air,” says Firestone.

	He says families are making vacation plan only to pull the plug when they learn these rules.

	“Many clients of mine who actually were booking Christmas vacations, have major concerns that after spending that two week lovely vacation to then be back home with two weeks quarantine in the home is just not going to fly, literally. So with that in mind, they’re cancelling those plans, if that’s the case,” says Firestone.

	Hillier, who represents the eastern Ontario riding of Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston, has frequently posted COVID-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories throughout the pandemic.

	The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines have been widely accepted by experts around the world.

	Families of those posted have come forward saying they were upset by the post and denied Hillier’s allegations.

	They include a complaint by Farisa Navab’s family. They say the 20-year-old Cambridge woman died in September from a rare blood disorder, not a COVID-19 vaccine.

	Hillier, who was kicked out of the Progressive Conservative caucus before the pandemic, has called on police to investigate the deaths.

	MPPs are expected to adhere to the members' Integrity Act.

	A member of the Integrity Commissioner’s Office said they can only investigate whether a breach has occurred if another MPP files a request under the Act.

	Last Friday, Waterloo NDP MPP Catherine Fife and NDP House Leader MPP Peggy Sattler submitted a co-written a letter to Integrity Commissioner David Wake.

	Also last Friday Premier Ford called Hillier’s post disgusting.

	Thursday’s motion - unanimously adopted by members of the legislature - said the house dissociates itself from Hillier's conduct. It also calls on him to apologize and ""desist from further conduct that is inappropriate and unbecoming"" of a member of the legislature.

	""Mr. Hillier’s decision to use the photograph and name of a deceased woman on social media, falsely claiming that her death was caused by the COVID-19 vaccine and his further refusal to remove this content continues to be extremely hurtful to the affected family and is unacceptable from any person let alone an elected Member of Provincial Parliament,"" the statement from the legislature said.

	“The actions we have taken have had a positive impact,” said Higgs during Thursday’s news update. We went from over 1000 positive cases to 549, and a high of 68 people in hospital to 31. However our hospitals are still under pressure with 120 regional health authority staff absent due to COVID-related reasons.”

	Hospitalization triggers in the mandatory order are what the province uses to decide whether to lift the circuit breaker, Higgs told CTV Atlantic in an interview Thursday.

	""We wanted to get down to 10 in hospital,"" Higgs said. ""We had a kind of a range here, of less than 25, but down to 10 to reduce a mandatory order. Our hospitalizations were still in red, and maybe we'll go to orange, but we're still having impacts on elective surgeries.""

Chatham-Kent’s top doctor concerned over reaction to lifting of pandemic measures ,"Oct. 29, 2021 1:43 a.m. CST","
     
     Windsor, Ont.  - 
     
    
	Chatham-Kent’s medical officer of health-expressed concern some people might read too much into comments about pandemic measures like vaccine passports possibly being lifted in the New Year.

	Dr. David Colby thought the statement could become another reason for hesitancy, and asked, “What are people waiting for?”

    Advertisement
    
	During a news conference in Toronto on Oct. 22, the province announced the plan to manage the spread of COVID-19 would continue into January when it hoped to lift vaccine certificate requirements in settings officials deem are lower risk.

	Starting on Jan. 17, 2022, restaurants, sporting facilities and casino could host patrons without checking vaccination status, as long there are no concerning trends of virus transmission at that time.

	Colby cautioned people might be holding out thinking the pandemic will be over in a couple of months.

	“I’d be overjoyed if that happen,” says Colby. “Do I think that is likely, I think we will be dealing with this for quite a while yet.”

	Colby was pleased to announce 80 per cent of Chatham-Kent’s population 12 years old and up had received a double dose of vaccine, but remained concern about the unvaccinated population as the virus has been unpredictable.

	“No one anticipated the Delta strain,” stated Colby who added if it was not for the variant, “…we’d have enough herd immunity to be done with it.”

	Meanwhile, Chatham-Kent Council is expected to review a bylaw requiring wearing masks indoors.

	“When we adopted the mask by-law there was no requirement from the province,” said Mayor Darrin Canniff.

	The municipality’s CAO said the municipality still needed to abide by the safe reopening act.

	However, depending on what happens, “…we might have to require masks,” said Don Shropshire.

Assiniboine Park Zoo to vaccinate some animals against COVID-19,"Oct. 28, 2021 2:43 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	Some of the animals at Assiniboine Park Zoo will soon join nearly a million Manitobans in getting their COVID-19 vaccine.

	According to Dr. Chris Enright, director of veterinary services and animal welfare at the zoo, as a veterinary COVID-19 vaccine becomes available the zoo will begin to immunize some of its animals, including gibbons and tigers.

    Advertisement
    
	“Members of our species that we know are going to be susceptible, we’re going to add this level of protection to it,” he said.

	Enright said there is an evolving understanding of COVID-19 in the veterinary world, but they have learned that some wild animals are susceptible to it, including primates and members of the cat family.

	He said as COVID-19 has infected people across the world, it has also been found in some pets, as well as zoo animals.

	“It’s happened in zoo situations where it’s spilled over from people into members of the cat family, like lions, tigers, and snow leopards, as well as members of the primate family, like gorillas and orangutans,” Enright explained.

	Enright said the veterinary vaccine currently being developed is being created for domestic animals.

	“The vaccine we're acquiring is a veterinary-specific vaccine from a company called Zoetis,” he said.

	“It will be a series of two vaccinations using actually a different technology from the mRNA vaccines that we’re all hearing about for people.”

	Enright explained that the way they are going to administer the vaccine will depend on the animal.

	“Some of our animals are able to participate in their veterinary care and they present their shoulder for a vaccination,” he said. ""They know if they do it, they’ll get a click and they’ll get a treat,” he said

	Enright added that some animals aren’t as far along in their training so the vets have the option of administering it with a blowpipe or putting the animal under anesthesia.

	“We have a really comprehensive veterinary program and that includes checkups and vaccinations,” he said.

	“We already vaccinate things like our gibbons for a number of diseases already. COVID-19 is a vaccine that we’re going to add in on top of that.”

'I have no regrets at all': Victoria woman suffers allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine,"Oct. 28, 2021 1:22 a.m. CST","
     
     Victoria  - 
     
    
	A 32-year-old Victoria woman says she has no regrets about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, despite suffering an extremely rare allergic reaction after her first shot.

	Annie Taal got her first dose at the Archie Browning centre in Esquimalt in late May. She began to feel sick within minutes of leaving the vaccine centre, according to Island Health.

	“I couldn’t take a deep breath,"" she told the health authority, which shared her story in a media release Wednesday. ""I was winded and felt like I had a sunburn.""

	Taal returned to the recreation centre where nurses determined she was having an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine.

	The Victoria woman was diagnosed with serious allergies as a teenager and had asked her doctor whether or not she should get the COVID-19 vaccine, Island Health says.

	She was advised that the risks of contracting COVID-19 far outweighed those of an allergic reaction, according to the health authority.

	“I have no regrets at all,"" Taal said. ""I understand the fear and uncertainty many people are feeling, but the fact-based evidence shows us the vaccines are safe and they are the best way for us to move forward through the pandemic.”

	Taal was taken to Victoria General Hospital for observation after nurses at the recreation centre treated her.

	She was later referred to an immunologist in Victoria to determine if she could receive a second dose of vaccine. They used a technique called graded-dose administration – where the full dose is separated into smaller doses and provided over a span of time with close monitoring – and Taal is now fully vaccinated, according to Island Health.

	Taal was asked to participate in a study of people who have experienced an allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine.

	“I am grateful to be part of this study because we really don’t know yet why some people have these rare reactions,” she said. “If I can help just one person feel safer about getting their shot, it will be worth it.”

	Dr. Michael Benusic with Island Health says a very small number of people will react to the COVID-19 vaccine.

	“Severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are very rare – about 1 in 100,000 people will react,"" Benusic said. ""Our vaccination sites are set up to identify and respond to this when it occurs, which is exactly what happened with this patient.""

	A spokesperson for Island Health declined to say how many similar allergic reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine have been recorded in the island region, instead referring the question to the BC Centre for Disease Control.

	Island Health says approximately 10 per cent of Vancouver Island residents remain unvaccinated. The health authority says the unvaccinated ""are experiencing the vast majority of COVID-19 hospitalizations, critical care admissions, and deaths in critical care.""

	During a news conference on Tuesday, Saskatchewan Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab appeared to give his clearest indication yet that he has recommended additional COVID-19 measures to the government.

	Since implementing a province-wide mask mandate in September and requiring proof of vaccination or a negative test result in some settings as of Oct. 1, no further preventive measures have been introduced.

	In an Oct. 21 letter to Health Minister Paul Merriman, 21 medical health officers working in the province called for measures including a 28-day limit on private gathering sizes similar to what was in place during the early stages of Saskatchewan's reopening plan ""with some modifications for the fully immunized population.""

	Manitoba is once again expanding the eligibility for third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

	On Wednesday, the province said residents of ""congregate elderly persons housing"" are now recommended and eligible to receive the third dose.

	In a media briefing on Wednesday Dr. Joss Reimer, medical lead of Manitoba’s Vaccine Implementation Task Force, said health regions will begin work with the approximate 500 seniors’ housing facilities to make sure there are plans in place to ensure third dose vaccines are available for those who are eligible.

	Reimer said the reason for the third dose recommendation is based on immune responses in older people and the vaccine rollout.

	“Immune responses in older people can be less robust and they can wane more quickly over time,” said Reimer. “Based on age and the way we did the rollout in the spring, these were also some of the first people in Manitoba to receive their first and second dose.”

	Chambers of commerce were among the locations the Saskatchewan government announced would be distribution points for rapid test kits. The kits are offered free of charge.

	Fire halls are also among the locations that are offering the kits. However, the Saskatoon Fire Department opted out of the distribution program due to its COVID-19 protocols.

	While the tests are not as accurate as those which use the PCR method, they can serve as a first line of defence for people wanting to have an idea of their COVID-19 status.

	Results obtained through the self-administered tests can not be used as proof of a negative result under the province's COVID-19 vaccine mandate.

	Aebig said the Saskatoon chamber aims to hand out the tests between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays.

	""We're told we will be restocked regularly. We're not sure what that looks like just yet,"" Aebig said.

	Aebig said the chamber ran out of all 3,300 of their tests on Tuesday and doesn’t know when they’ll get more.

	Tests were also handed out at Warman City Hall – with their supply of 3,500 tests, they are down by about 800 so far.

	Warman Mayor Gary Philipchuk said he is glad they can help distribute the tests and give a sense of relief to some.

	Warman dad Garett Mathiason has two kids, age two and six and wanted to get the tests for his family’s peace of mind.

	Although COVID-19 cases are slightly declining in Alberta, two doctors who treat patients from rural areas say a fifth wave may be inevitable if people in those communities do not get vaccinated at a faster pace.

	Provincial data says 78.3 per cent of eligible Albertans overall, including those who are 12 and older, are fully vaccinated and 86.4 per cent have had at least one shot.

       Alberta reports 12 deaths, 442 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday

	Dr. Raman Kumar, a family doctor at Maxwell Medical in Fort McMurray, Alta., says the rural population is overrepresented in overwhelmed intensive care units “simply because of the fact that there has been more vaccine hesitancy” among them.

	“For example, here in Fort McMurray, we've had significant issues with our intensive care units being full of patients and we transport our patients to other communities,” said Kumar.

	“We had seven nurses come from Newfoundland (to Fort McMurray during the fourth wave), so COVID definitely has been a major, major problem for rural communities.”

	In High Level, one of the most northern municipalities in Alberta, 23 per cent of residents have had at least their first dose of vaccine. The number is 39 per cent in the County of Forty Mile in the south and 40 per cent in Two Hills County in east-central Alberta.

	On average, 55 per cent of Albertans living in Manning, Peace River, Fairview, Spirit River, St. Paul, and Lethbridge have had their first dose.

	“If we don't achieve higher vaccination rates in some areas, we'll be at risk of a fifth wave and sixth wave because of the ongoing transmission,” said Dr. Finola Hackett, a rural family health physician working in Pincher Creek.

	“As we've seen with the fourth wave, a low vaccination rate did not protect from COVID and the Delta variants, so there's a higher risk for sure in some rural areas.”

	Hackett and Kumar say three main factors contribute to the low vaccine intake in rural communities.

	“I call them the three Cs,” said Hackett.

	“There is complacency, convenience, and then the third one being conspiracy.”

	Hackett said complacency can be seen in some Albertans “who are especially younger” in rural communities who have told her they don't want to get a shot because they believe they are healthy. She said she tells them that the vaccine not only protects them from the virus, but also reduces the risk of transmission to others with compromised immunity.

	Convenience is a matter of accessibility.

	“The government and other partners send mobile clinics to some rural areas so that helped ... but there's still pockets of those who might have issues with (transportation).”

	The third C and most common reason why rural Albertans are not getting vaccinated is the “pandemic of misinformation,” Hackett said.

	“Sometimes ... a small, tight-knit community is sharing misinformation that spreads fast,” she said. “Certain rural areas, that tend to be more conservative, are more distrustful of any government program.”

	Hackett and Kumar said they have met several patients in rural Alberta, sometimes multiple times, and have persuaded them to get vaccinated.

	“I just don't think that acting on frustration or polarization gets us anywhere, as hard as it is finding that patience and energy to understand empathetically why someone is vaccine hesitant,” said Hackett.

	The doctors said they are helping to launch a new campaign in rural Alberta througha national multidisciplinary coalition called 19 to Zero that is working toshift public perceptions around COVID-19 behaviours and build confidence in vaccines.

	The campaign called “It's Never Too Late” includes a video shot in an Alberta hospital. It shows a person breathing heavily while being assessed and admitted into intensive care to be intubated.

	“I just want to tell Albertans, that heck, get the vaccine,” Kumar said.

	“Let's get back to normal life, and the way we can do that is by all of us getting our shot.”

	Another 591 people recovered from COVID-19 as well, according to the ministry, pushing the province's active caseload to 4,829, down from 4,966 on Monday.

	Tuesday's update once again shows the majority of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and ICU visits involve the unvaccinated. Approximately 86 per cent of ICU patients haven't received a single dose of vaccine, according to a table shared by Health Minister Adrian Dix on Twitter, including 41 of the 42 patients who are under the age of 50.

	Just under 90 per cent of eligible B.C. residents have received at least one dose of vaccine, and nearly 85 per cent have received two.

	Earlier on Tuesday, Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry confirmed the province is offering booster shots to several vulnerable groups before the end of the year, and expanding access to the broader population beginning in January.

	Officials previously decided to provide third shots to some seniors in care, whose bodies are said to have developed weaker antibody responses following vaccination, leading to a new wave of outbreaks in those settings.

	

	

	There are currently 28 active outbreaks across B.C.'s health-care system, according to the ministry, including 23 in long-term care homes and assisted living facilities.

	Henry said emerging data indicates that immunity wanes over time with the general population as well, but that a booster could offer long-lasting protection. She stressed that a third shot shouldn't be necessary for the general population during this winter respiratory season, however.

	""Most of us have good, strong protection and we don't need a booster dose right now, but come next spring it is something we should consider,"" she said.

4 Alberta doctors file lawsuit against AHS over vaccine requirement,"Oct. 26, 2021 7:21 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Opposition to the province's vaccine policies is starting to hit the courts. In an 11-page statement of claim, four Alberta doctors are suing Alberta Health Services (AHS) and its CEO, Dr. Verna Yiu over its policy of mandatory vaccinations. 

	In the lawsuit, Dr. Eric T. Payne (Calgary), Dr. Joanna J. Moser (Calgary), Dr. Gregory Keen-Wai Chan (Ponoka), and Dr. David Loewen (Grande Prairie), claim they have “suffered vilification and extreme ill-will being directed at them as 'unvaccinated' people as a result of Dr. Yiu, Premier (Jason) Kenney, and other Government of Alberta representatives making false public statements and promulgating policies which have the effect of stating that the unvaccinated are to blame for the pandemic and hospital over crowding.”

    Advertisement
    
	The suit also claims the in being placed on unpaid leave, the four are “being held up to public opprobrium, ridicule, hatred, maltreatment, discrimination, detestation, contempt, enmity, extreme ill-will, denigration, abuse, or delegitimization on the basis of their vaccine status.""

       Alberta leaves 'essential services' out of restriction exemption program Lack of worker vaccine requirement in Alberta a 'loophole,' says health law expert Almost eight in 10 support proof-of-vaccine requirement to visit public places: pollSome universities say no to proof of vaccination requirement

	Albertans will need to prove they have both jabs of a COVID-19 vaccine to go into most restaurants, movie theatres, sporting events and non-essential businesses beginning Monday, adhering to Alberta’s Restrictions Exemption Program (REP).

	Second doses must have been administered at least two weeks prior to be acceptable under the government’s new regulations.

	The REP requires any customer entering businesses it covers to show proof of vaccination or present a negative rapid antigen, rapid PCR, or lab-based PCR, at their own cost.

	Those able to present valid proof of a medical exemption may be able to bypass the requirements.

	The government presently allows a printed version of vaccinations records, a printed vaccination certificate available at the myhealthalberta website or a downloadable QR code.

	Starting Nov. 15, the QR code will become the only accepted method of proof in Alberta.

	At the same time, governments, as well as many private companies, have instituted mandatory vaccination policies.

	AHS announced Aug. 31 that all AHS staff, members of the medical and midwifery professions, as well as students and volunteers would have to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 31.  That deadline was subsequently moved to Nov. 30.

	The lawsuit claims the AHS policy is both unethical and unlawful saying, “Any medical procedure performed on a patient without their informed consent amounts to assault.""

	It adds, “To the extent that the policy seeks to coerce employees to be vaccinated against their will, without informed consent, the policy amounts to an expressed intention to engage in a conspiracy to commit assault.""

	The suit also claims the mandatory vaccination policy breaches the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, and contravenes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

	University of Calgary law professor Lorian Hardcastle says she is not surprised that lawsuits are now making their way to the courts, but doubts most of the claims will be successful.

	“The allegations around informed consent and assault are, are quite confusing, because, of course, nobody is forcing treatment on anyone. (However)  I think that the allegations around constructive dismissal, and some of the employment kinds of allegations might have a little bit more meat to them,” said Hardcastle.

	“Certainly the prevailing wisdom does seem to be that employment lawsuits around mandatory vaccines are likely to fail, and in part because of the pandemic and the compelling situation we find ourselves in, but also, in part, because courts I think, would be very reluctant to strike down a vaccine mandate, because of course, so many employers have them now.”

	Hardcastle expects to see more lawsuits regarding mandatory vaccinations of workers as the policies come in effect and some staff have their employment curtailed.

	“I think we will see some wrongful dismissal kinds of employment law cases. I think we will see complaints to human rights tribunals in various provinces around vaccine mandates. We might see some Labour Law disputes where we're talking about a unionised workforce.” said Hardcastle, who maintains it is important for the courts to weigh in on the issues in order to provide clear direction to both employers and governments.

	“If one of these cases does make it to the Supreme Court of Canada, they may not rule before the pandemic is over, but at least then we would have some helpful guidance from them on when it's appropriate to mandate vaccines when it's constitutional to mandate vaccines. But I think at least we'll get some lower level court decisions and Human Rights Tribunal decisions, which will be helpful in the in the interim.”

	In the meantime, Hardcastle notes the Alberta government has signalled it will bring in legislation protecting employers from lawsuits as a result of imposing vaccination mandates. While the legislature resumed sitting Monday that piece of legislation has not yet been tabled.

	“The legislation could address the employment law type claims, or the Labour Law type claims, it could also amend the human rights legislation to address employers drawing distinctions on the basis of vaccines, we just aren't really sure what's coming in terms of that of that legislation. But certainly, it could affect these disputes. And could itself be the subject of litigation,"" she said.

	The lawsuit, prepared on behalf of the Alberta doctors, has been submitted but as of publication Monday, has not yet been filed with the courts. As a result, no statement of defence has been submitted by AHS or Dr. Yiu.

	Leslie Echino, who owns Annabelle’s Kitchen in Calgary says the relief comes at a much-needed time. She says her sales are down roughly 80 per cent since the new stay-at-home work suggestion was delivered at the beginning of September.

	“That's basically almost unheard of, and very shocking, very scary as a business owner that's been downtown for 14 years. I lived downtown, I worked downtown, just this location has about 14 employees and we used to have 28 before the pandemic,” Echino said.

	“I was scared for the first time in 14 years that I might actually not make it, so for me personally as a downtown restaurant owner, I am beyond thankful.”

	Executive director with the Calgary Hotel Association, Sol Zia, also applauds Ottawa for helping businesses given that travel has been limited due to the pandemic.

	“We're a category that was sacrificed during the pandemic and we insisted on some sort of guarantee of future programs, so we're very happy the federal government has come through with a continuance of wage subsidy and rent subsidy for the hardest hit,” he said.

	Zia adds however that summer 2021 was a much-needed boost for the industry with the Calgary Stampede going ahead, which makes him worry some hotels may lose eligibility for the program.

	“Hotels were open, running events and festivals, but unfortunately closing down much of their operations very early in September again,” said Zia.

	“So the details will be important. It could be an impediment, we don't really know, but we're still in negotiation with the federal government.”

	Another program starting Sunday – the Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program – will provide wage and rent subsidies of up to 50 per cent to businesses that don’t fit under the tourism and hospitality industry, but can still show ‘deep and enduring losses,’ according to deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.

	The Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) also ended Saturday and will now be replaced by the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for those whose work is directly impacted by temporary government-imposed lock downs.

	The program is available until May 7, 2022, retroactive to Oct. 24 and will provide $300 per week to eligible workers.

	Federal Employment Minister Carla Qualthrough told CTV’s Question Period that the new benefit will only apply to people who can’t work due to lockdowns in their region and it won’t apply where there are only capacity restrictions for businesses.

	“The premise is, that workers unable to work due to a local lockdown anytime between Oct. 24 and May 7, will be eligible to get this $300 per week payment,” she said.

	“It will be driven by how a province or a region characterizes the lockdown, if they declare a complete lockdown.”

	Qualthrough adds that people who are out of work or losing income because of a refusal to adhere to a vaccine mandate would also not qualify for support.

	As of Oct. 10, the federal government had paid out $27 billion to more than two million unique CRB applicants.

	GOVERNMENT SET THE BAR TOO HIGH: CFIB

	The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) is pleased with the extension of benefits, but there are further concerns that the government has set the bar too high to obtain support.

	“We’re quite concerned that arts recreation and those kinds of event-based industries may not be eligible for that tourism, hospitality funding stream when they've also been severely impacted,” said Alberta CFIB director Annie Dormuth.

	“It's important to recognize that according to our own calculations in Alberta, arts, recreation and fitness businesses were only completely close to in person services 50 less days than restaurants.”

	Dormuth adds that the CFIB is calling on the federal government to broaden the definitions of ‘hard-hit’ businesses and lower the revenue loss threshold to 30 per access for the new relief programs.

	She also notes that new businesses that have opened up during the pandemic should also still be eligible for support.

	“New businesses have been unable to access any of the federal support programs throughout the entire pandemic and unfortunately that appears to be the same case here again. That's one of our strong recommendations to the federal government, as well as even looking at making some changes to the Canadian emergency business account loan because small businesses have accumulated a lot of COVID-19 related debt.”

	CEO and president of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce Deborah Yeldin agrees that the support comes at an important time for local businesses, although owners have limited time to adjust.

	She says it was unfair for Ottawa to announce changes on a Thursday that come into effect on a Sunday will lead to businesses scrambling to ensure they meet the new qualifications and can properly apply.

	“Businesses need advance notice and a more gradual phase out of support programs to plan and prepare for significant changes to government supports,” Yedlin said.

	“At the same time, the Calgary Chamber of Commerce is pleased to see targeted supports for businesses that continue to need assistance and a clear plan to phasing out pandemic relief measures altogether in spring 2022.”

	“I want to send heartfelt condolences to those who are grieving the loss of their loved one,” added Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “I encourage all New Brunswickers to do their part to put our province in a better position to fight this virus.”

	The province has reported 35 COVID-19 related deaths since Friday, Oct. 8.

	40 NEW CASES SATURDAY

	Health officials in New Brunswick are also reporting 40 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, along with 81 recoveries, as the total number of active cases in the province drops to 689.

	According to health officials, 21 of Saturday's 40 new cases, or 52.5 per cent, are unvaccinated. Five cases, or 12.5 per cent, are partially vaccinated, and 14 cases, or 35 per cent, are fully vaccinated.

	The province says there are currently 43 people in hospital in New Brunswick due to COVID-19, with 13 in an intensive care unit. Of those currently in hospital, 22 are unvaccinated, two are partially vaccinated, and 19 are fully vaccinated.

	Of the 13 people in the ICU, none are fully vaccinated, 12 are unvaccinated, and one is partially vaccinated.

	""What we are seeing now, is basically a surge in the number of cases, and I think it has to do with loosening of restrictions in the summer, probably after July,” says Dr. Zahid Butt an infectious disease epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Waterloo's School of Public Health Sciences.

	Although there are circuit-breakers in effect for different parts of the province, Dr. Butt believes a circuit breaker should be extended to all of New Brunswick to slow the fourth wave.

	""This is the Delta variant, so the Delta variant is highly transmissable so you'd have to go one step ahead of the virus,"" says Butt. ""You cannot wait to see another region turning into a hotspot before you implement another circuit breaker lockdown.""

	Meanwhile, New Brunswick’s opposition leader is calling for more resources from the province to go towards better control at our borders.

	""Right now there's no control points, and for me, that's a serious concern,"" says Roger Melanson, leader of New Brunswick’s Liberal opposition. ""People who do enter New Brunswick need to register online and need to prove online through their registration that they're double vaxxed, but there's no checkpoints - people can come in anyway, doubly vaxxed or not.""

AHS extending mandatory vaccine deadline as immunization rate hovers at 94 per cent,"Oct. 23, 2021 9:45 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	Alberta Health Services is giving employees “every opportunity” to get vaccinated against COVID-19, including extending the deadline by which they need to prove full immunization in order to keep working.

	AHS on Friday pushed the initial Oct. 31 deadline back to Nov. 30.

    Advertisement
    
	Officials at the agency said they ""stand by"" AHS' mandatory vaccine policy and promised it would be fully implemented, but that the change in due date was to give both employees and facility operators more time.

	""We are also seeing some challenges with contracted providers, including a number of continuing care sites, particularly those in rural areas where the immunization uptake has been low,” AHS president and CEO Dr. Verna Yiu said.

	""I think it just mirrors the immunization rates that we see in the province and how it is disproportionately higher in certain areas versus others.”

	She said the challenges are being felt across the province outside Alberta's largest cities. 

	Operators asked AHS for more time to prepare contingency plans. 

	“For example, they may not bring in new admissions, as an example, to try to keep the numbers lower. They may look at essential services, what’s essential for that site,"" Yiu said of options operators could consider if faced with staff shortages. 

	As of Friday, 94 per cent of all workers across AHS were vaccinated. That included 94 per cent of physicians, 97 per cent of ICU staff, and 76 per cent of casual employees who had submitted proof of full immunization. 

	A total of 61 employees had quit over the vaccine mandate, including 11 registered nurses and 20 in other clinical roles.

	AHS also had more than 1,400 medical or religious exemption requests to review before the deadline, but Yiu said the agency was setting the bar ""pretty high.""

	She told reporters she was confident the extra time would see more staff sign up for COVID-19 vaccine. 

	Leaders have been directed to meet with employees who either are vaccine hesitant or who have not submitted proof of vaccination. 

	“These individual conversations are really important, offers to speak to experts, we’ve got resources in place to not just help our managers in the conversation but also educational tools that people can take a look at, and we’re including peer discussions in this because we think it’s important to not just have it come from a leader, but also as colleagues,” AHS' CEO said. 

	Those who do not have an exemption approved and refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine could be placed on an unpaid leave of absence until they get vaccinated. 

	Yiu said there's ""always been a risk"" of further straining the health-care system if employees quit, but that the high number of staff already vaccinated would help. 

	""I think we have enough staff on right now that we can absorb that and we’re pretty confident, at least from an acute care perspective, that we’ve got enough immunized to be able to offset those who are still waiting to make the decision.”

	She added the potential is exacerbated by Alberta's rate of staff vacancy, which moves between 10 and 30 per cent. 

	The vaccine mandate, announced at the beginning of September, applies to all AHS, Alberta Precision Labs, Carewest, CapitalCare and Covenant Health employees, members of the medical and midwifery staffs, students, and volunteers. 

	Workers who get vaccinated after Nov. 30 will be able to return to work when they provide proof of full vaccination. 

	AHS said it was not pursuing terminations for non-compliant staff at the time.

'A bit difficult to explain': Business owners question COVID-19 rules limiting dancing as other restrictions lift,"Oct. 22, 2021 4:43 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	While capacity limits on many indoor venues in parts of B.C. will ease next week, dancing is still prohibited, which some owners say will continue to hurt their business.

	B.C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, says dancing at nightclubs and at indoor weddings still isn't allowed, even though other restrictions at venues are lifting on Tuesday.

	""I know it's going to be hardest, particularly, for nightclubs and some of the bars where this is an important part of the atmosphere,"" Henry said during her weekly COVID-19 update.

	Members of the industry, however, are hoping the province will reconsider that rule.

	""It's a bit difficult to explain to folks why you can have a concert with 10,000 people where everyone's congregating together or a hockey game and yet I can't with 100 people in a nightclub,"" said Jeff Guignard of the BC Alliance of Beverage Licensees.

	""But it's a gradual, phased reopening and I've often said there's no point in looking for logic in some of these rules, we're all just doing the best we can … our commitment will be to keep dance floors closed and do our best to manage our patron behaviours.""

	Business owners have also raised questions about enforcement, like what exactly is considered dancing and whether people can dance at their individual tables.

	Dave Kershaw, owner of the Cabana Lounge, said the rules are costing his business tens of thousands of dollars.

	""People have, in the last few weeks, really started to cancel their reservations because they felt they went and got vaccinated to have a proper experience at a nightclub,"" Kershaw said.

	Henry said she hopes people, especially those who have their vaccine card, will continue to support local businesses.

	""We are absolutely continuing to monitor,"" Henry said on Tuesday. ""I hope to be able to take off more restrictions as we get through the next few months, but it's going to be a challenge for all of us.""

Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries to implement COVID-19 vaccine policy,"Oct. 22, 2021 4:03 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries will be implementing a COVID-19 vaccine policy at the start of next year.

	According to a spokesperson for the Crown corporation, employees will have to choose to voluntarily provide proof of full vaccination or take part in rapid testing.

    Advertisement
    
	This policy will come into effect on Jan. 10, 2022, and includes all employees working or attending Manitoba Liquor and Lottery locations, as well as employees who attend partner sites.

	Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries is a Crown corporation of the Province of Manitoba, which announced its own vaccine policy earlier in the year.

	At the end of August, the Manitoba government announced that certain designated provincial employees would be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo regular testing. These designated workers include direct health-care providers, educational and child-care workers, and public servants who work in high-risk settings with direct contact with the public.

	While the campaign could start as soon as the beginning of December, Mackie said that date could fluctuate from a couple of weeks up to a month.

	For those who have already been vaccinated, the process is expected to be much the same, Mackie said.

	""The plan is fairly similar to the first few waves, so we will have large mass vaccination clinics open at the Agriplex and Mount Brydges out in the Strathroy-Caradoc area. We will have pharmacy partners, lining up to make sure that they can offer vaccine as well.""

	The mass vaccination clinics, which are currently accepting all walk-ins, will move back to an appointment-based system to manage volume, Mackie explained.

	""It won't be possible to have everybody show up on day one, as soon as everyone I'm sure would want. So we'll have to spread those out, so people will use the covidvaccinelm.ca website to book their appointments.""

	It's expected to take two to three weeks to get all the newly eligible kids their first dose, and the same for second doses a month later.

	After the initial rollout, Mackie says there will be ""catch up campaigns out of the mobile clinics, school clinics and that sort of thing, to make sure that for those for whom access is an issue, we can reduce barriers as much as possible.""

	Primary care providers like family doctors are not expected to play as active a role in this rollout.

	Higgs said his government has faced a lot of questions since easing COVID-19 restrictions in the province at the end of July.

	""Did we underestimate the Delta variant? Did we ease restrictions too soon? Were we overly confident that more New Brunswickers would get vaccinated? I know that many of you are frustrated and in some cases angry that we are still living with COVID,"" Higgs said. ""I understand this because I, too, feel the same way.""

	When restrictions were lifted on July 31, New Brunswick had reported 46 deaths related to the virus. During the last two-and-a-half months, that number has more than doubled.

	""I take responsibility for everything, everywhere that relates to the citizens of the province,"" said Higgs. ""I obviously deeply regret the situation we're in right now.""

	CIRCUIT BREAKER EXTENDED

	Higgs said while the number of new and active cases have moved in the right direction since the province implemented ""circuit breaker"" measures on Oct. 8, the numbers are still too high.

	""That is why on the advice of public health and the cabinet COVID-19 committee, we've decided to extend circuit breaker measure for at least seven days,"" Higgs said. ""The Delta variant is different than anything we've experienced so far, that is why we need to treat it differently.""

	The areas affected are Zone 1 (Moncton region) as far north as and including Sainte-Anne-de-Kent and including Havelock in Zone 2; the northern portion of Zone 3 from and including Deerville and Florenceville-Bristol, but excluding Hayesville and Parker Ridge; and all of Zone 4 (Edmundston region).

	""We have seen encouraging data since the circuit breaker measures went into effect, but it is still too early to know if cases in the affected areas will continue to steadily decline in the days ahead,” Dr. Jennifer Russell, the province's chief medical officer of health said. “If we were to remove these measures now, without knowing for certain that we are experiencing a sustained downward trend in cases and hospitalizations, we could prolong the situation even further.”

	Russell said in a news release that the measures will be lifted when public health can confirm ""a sustained trend of decreasing numbers of cases and a decline in the seven-day average of new hospital admissions.""

	14-DAY CIRCUIT BREAKER IN ZONE 5 STARTS FRIDAY

	New Brunswick Public Health also announced that Zone 5 (the Campbellton region) will enter a 14-day circuit breaker starting Friday at 6 p.m. to bring the high number of COVID-19 transmissions in the region under control.

	""I know this news is difficult for those living in Zone 5 and for those in the current circuit breaker areas, as you have worked hard,"" Higgs said in a news release. ""The numbers are slowly getting better, but the Delta variant is different from anything we have experienced before, and we need to treat it differently.""

	You can find more information online about the circuit breaker rules and the areas it covers, including maps.





	67 NEW CASES CONFIRMED, ALONG WITH 63 RECOVERIES

	Public Health reported 67 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday along with 63 recoveries, raising the number of active cases in New Brunswick to 763.

	Of the new cases, 38 – or 57 per cent – are unvaccinated, four – or six per cent – are partially vaccinated, and 25 – or 37 per cent – are fully vaccinated, public health said in a news release.

	HIGGS ALLUDES TO MISTAKES, BUT DEFENDS PUBLIC HEALTH

	On Thursday afternoon, Higgs alluded to mistakes made along the way. When asked about them in an interview with CTV Atlantic later in the day, Higgs elaborated.

	""We thought that 75 per cent vaccination rate would give us herd immunity and we'd be good,"" Higgs told CTV Atlantic in an interview. ""I mean there were points where we thought 70 per cent was going to do that just fine back in early July, and now we're saying no, that's not the case at all. It's 90 per cent, so you know, we need to learn through this entire pandemic of what needs to be done differently.""

	Higgs also pointed out the onslaught of criticism he and the public health team in New Brunswick has not gone unnoticed.

	""One of the things that I underestimated, is that how quickly people really turn on you,"" Higgs said. ""You know, because, because everyone has worked so hard, not just me, I mean I'm just one of a team of many people that have worked tirelessly and through this and done very well, whether it's at borders, whether it's testing, whatever. So, so, yeah, we have a hard spot here right now but I'll stick with the team, we'll get through this.""

	MAJORITY OF PATIENTS IN ICU WITH COVID-19 ARE UNVACCINATED

	Public health says there are 55 people hospitalized because of the novel coronavirus. Of those, 27 are unvaccinated, five are partially vaccinated and 23 are fully vaccinated. There are 16 people in an intensive care unit, with 14 unvaccinated and two partially vaccinated.

	""Many of the 23 people who are fully vaccinated who are currently in the hospital did not have COVID-19 when they were admitted,"" public health said in a news release. ""They contracted the virus while hospitalized for other reasons due to the ongoing outbreaks at the Moncton Hospital and the Campbellton Regional Hospital.""

	Russell said these fully vaccinated patients are ""generally experiencing mild symptoms.""

	NEW RULES FOR POSITIVE RAPID-TEST RESULTS

	The province's emergency order has been updated to require anyone who gets a positive result from a rapid-test kit at home to immediately schedule an appointment for a lab-based PCR test at a public health assessment centre.

	You can book an appointment online or by calling 811.

	""Anyone who fails to do so will be subject to fines,"" public health said in a news release. ""Peace officers will investigate information received through employer testing programs and from residents to ensure individuals are complying.""

	RAPID-TEST KITS AVAILABLE FOR PICKUP

	Public health has made free rapid COVID-19 screening tests available for those who have not tested positive for COVID-19.

	The tests are designed for people two and older and most have five tests to be used over a 10-day period. People 16 and under must be accompanied by an adult to acquire a kit.

	On Wednesday, the province distributed 7,333 rapid-test kits.

	A full list of locations is available online for both Vitalité and Horizon health networks. More information on the rapid-test kits program is available online.

	VACCINATION UPDATE

	Public Health reported Thursday that 83.1 per cent of eligible New Brunswickers are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and 91.9 per cent have received their first dose of a vaccine.

	If you have not yet had your first or second dose, you can go to a walk-in clinic or book an appointment through a participating pharmacy or at a Vitalité or Horizon health network clinic.

	All eligible New Brunswickers can book a second-dose appointment for a date that is at least 28 days after the first dose.

	A list of upcoming mobile and walk-in clinics is available online.

	Health-care workers – including those working in long-term care facilities – and residents of First Nations communities can get an mRNA COVID-19 booster starting Oct. 25.

	To get the booster dose, six months must have passed since the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

	CONFIRMED CASES IN SCHOOLS AND CHILD-CARE FACILITIES

Kulbaba's post prompted an outpouring of sympathy, with many of his thousands of followers offering non-medical advice for treating his symptoms, recommending remedies ranging from melatonin to vitamin C. Some also suggested he take the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, which has not been proven to treat COVID-19.  ""Ivermectin for horses comes in a paste. Take one-tenth of a tube a day,"" one commenter wrote, possibly in jest.  ""Thanks for dose info,"" responded another.  Ivermectin prompted a warning from Health Canada over the summer following a spike in poison control centre calls regarding people who had taken the drug against medical advice.  ""There is no evidence that ivermectin works to prevent or treat COVID-19, and it is not authorized for this use,"" Health Canada said at the time.  ""Health Canada has not received any drug submission or applications for clinical trials for ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.""

	""Three of the four in the intensive care unit were fully immunized,"" said Dr. Charles Gardner during a COVID-19 update on Wednesday.

	The region's top doctor noted that 39 per cent of cases in the past week were ""breakthrough cases,"" meaning fully vaccinated individuals.

	Still, he said this isn't unexpected.

	""The proportion of our cases that are breakthrough cases will go up over time. That does not change the degree of protection for people who received immunization,"" Gardner said.

	The medical officer added that the vaccine offers a ""high degree of protection"" against COVID-19.

	""In fact, if you're not immunized, you're 10 times more likely to become a case and 23 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital,"" Gardner said.

	He mentioned the rise in vaccinated patients or cases is due to the widespread vaccination coverage for the region's population.

	""We expect it to increase over time because it is partly a function of how complete our vaccination coverage is for the population,"" he noted.

	Despite the rise in vaccinated cases, local case counts have fallen in five of the past six weeks.

	However, Gardner said it's still too early to know what, if any, impact Thanksgiving get-togethers will have on infection rates.

	This time last year, cases surged 15 per cent.

STF calls for tighter measures in schools as fourth wave continues in Sask.,"Oct. 21, 2021 7:01 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	The Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation [STF] is calling for the province to take more action to address COVID-19 transmission in schools.

	STF president Patrick Maze said Wednesday the organization is aware of cases where those exposed to COVID-19 in a classroom were not aware of the exposure until near the end of their isolation period.

    Advertisement
    
	“Unfortunately when people are finding out 10 or 15 days after they’ve been exposed that they need to isolate but there’s only a day or two left or no time left in the requirement, that just allows COVID to spread further in our schools,” Maze said.
        RELATED STORIES

	Other issues include breakthrough cases in vaccinated staff and difficulties in finding substitute teachers.

	The STF also called for the return of the Education Sector Response Planning Team that helped determine COVID-19 measures in schools,saying the direct line of communication it provided between the team, government and health officials was critical for pandemic planning last year.

	""We need to make a decision. Do we want to end COVID or do we want to keep schools open at all costs?"" Maze said.

	During a provincial update Wednesday morning, chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said some increase in transmission within school settings was “expected” given that children 11 and under continue to be the largest demographic of unvaccinated people.

	According to Shahab, 23 per cent of cases under 11 are connected to school settings, but many continue to come from the household, especially when others in the home are also unvaccinated.

	“We aren’t seeing large outbreaks, we’re seeing clusters of two or three cases in class,” Shahab said. “We’re watching that closely.”

	Shahab also reaffirmed schools reflect the level of community transmission.

	""Compared to last year less schools are going online, there’s less disruption, children are able to do a lot of activities in school including sports,"" Shahab said.

	“The information that has been shared with me is that schools are still relatively safe when it comes to the transmission of COVID-19,” Education Minister Dustin Duncan said. “We certainly are still trying to encourage as many people, including students who are eligible, to get vaccinated.”

	Health Canada is currently reviewing approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children under 12.

	Most teenagers have been eligible since May, and have embraced the shot for the most part.

	""The youth are putting our young adults to shame by having a higher vaccination rate. I’ve always said we should learn from our seniors, but we should also learn from our 12-17 year olds on how to get vaccinated,"" Shahab said.

B.C. Children's Hospital ER seeing increase in number of patients with respiratory viruses ,"Oct. 21, 2021 10:22 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	An “unusually high” number of patients with respiratory viruses have been showing up over the past month at the B.C. Children's Hospital emergency department, according to the hospital.

	General pediatrician Dr. Claire Seaton said nearly 30 per cent of all emergency department visits from mid-September to mid-October were for respiratory-related illnesses, up nearly 10 per cent from before the pandemic.

    Advertisement
    
	""Looking at data from before COVID, we’re probably seeing around 300 more children in the last month than we did two years ago,"" she said. ""Of course, during COVID and last season, we really didn’t see any of these winter viruses at all.""

	 The hospital said it’s seeing more cases involving respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza, and earlier than usual.

	RSV is one of the common cold viruses, and usually causes mild illness or bronchiolitis in young infants. Symptoms can be more severe in babies under six months old, especially those who were born premature or have chronic heart or lung conditions. The hospital said B.C. did not see any reported cases of RSV last winter.

	""So we are expecting a higher rate, and earlier rates of RSV infection, and we think that’s just starting to happen here,"" Dr. Seaton said. ""It’s already happened in other places around the world. For example in Quebec, they’re busy with hospitalizations for those conditions and we’re getting prepared for it to happen here.""

	Parainfluenza is an infection that can cause symptoms ranging from a mild cold, to more severe illnesses including croup and pneumonia. It can also trigger asthma in children.

	B.C. Children’s Hospital said the emergency department has also been testing a high number of children for COVID-19, on about 30 per cent of ER visits, which may correlate with visits for respiratory illness. Of more than 1,200 tests processed through the emergency department over the last month, less than two per cent came back positive, and there were no hospitalizations.

	""COVID is definitely what we’re all talking about,"" Dr. Seaton said. ""But right now it’s all these other respiratory viruses that are important, and are probably going to put our kids more likely into a hospital bed or into the emergency department than COVID itself.""

	Often, RSV goes away on its own and can be treated at home. Young babies and those born prematurely sometimes need treatment in hospital. B.C. Children’s is asking families to keep an eye on their children’s symptoms, and head to the emergency department if they notice difficulty breathing, grunting sounds, breathing really hard, or if the child is turning pale or blue.

	The hospital is also reminding parents the safety measures associated with COVID-19 can also help protect children from other viruses, including staying home when sick, washing hands, and following mask mandates.

	On Tuesday, B.C. also made flu shots free for all who are eligible, in the hopes of encouraging more vaccination to reduce strain on the health-care system.

	Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre medical director Dr. Brian Conway said the return of influenza is a concern, in part due to the lack of community immunity from last year.

	""Instead of several thousand cases last year, we had 18 or 19,"" he said. ""We base this year’s vaccine on last year’s flu season. There was no flu season. This year’s vaccine is an educated guess...and finally, we do not know what combined infection with influenza and COVID looks like.""

	Dr. Conway said increased interactions are likely also behind the resurgence of other respiratory viruses this year.

	""Last year at this time, we were interacting with each other at a rate that was 40 per cent of the pre-covid normal,"" he said. ""Now we’re at 80 to 90 per cent.""

	Flu shots have already been rolling out this week in the province. London Drugs pharmacy division general manager Chris Chiew said the initial response has already been strong.

	""We’ve been booked up solid for all of this week, and all of next week as well,"" he said, and added there will be more supply provided to pharmacies this year following record demand last year. ""We just ask everybody be patient for the first couple of weeks, you will definitely get your shot.""

	Dr. Seaton said along with the influenza vaccine, routine childhood immunizations are also important, including pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccines, which can prevent complications of viral infections.

	""Antibiotics don’t treat these viral infections, the vast majority just need a bit of tender loving care at home,"" she said. ""Fluids, keeping your child comfortable, looking out for those severe signs of illness and knowing when to come into the emergency department.""

	The Boston-based conglomerate is the latest U.S. employer to impose such a requirement, which has sparked a political fight.

	While supporters of vaccine mandates see them as necessary to pull the country out of the nearly two-year-old pandemic, critics are calling them unconstitutional and authoritarian.

	The White House has said vaccine requirements have driven up COVID-19 vaccination rates by 20 percentage points.

	The measure has drawn a sharp reaction from some Republicans, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott last week barring COVID-19 vaccine mandates by any entity, including private employers.

	Union Pacific Corp and its three unions have sued each other over the vaccine mandate.

     Vancouver - 
     
    
	With just one week to go before B.C.'s broader COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health-care workers comes into effect, about 5,500 employees have yet to receive their first dose.

	Health Minister Adrian Dix said that number doesn't include unvaccinated workers from long-term care homes and assisted living facilities, who were forced from their jobs on Oct. 12 when the province imposed its mandate in those settings.

	The 5,512 workers from hospitals and other health-care settings who remain unvaccinated – and who represent four percent of the 129,924 employees facing the expanded mandate – have until Oct. 26 to get their first dose to avoid facing the same consequences.

	""We're hopeful, of course, that people will move to get vaccinated and comply with the upcoming order,"" Dix said.

	According to the public health order implementing the mandate, employees who only have one dose can continue working as long as they take certain precautions, and get their second dose between 28 and 35 days after their first.

	Workers who fail to meet the Oct. 26 deadline will have until Nov. 15 to get their first dose, and won't be able to return to their jobs until seven days after the shot. They also have to get their second within 35 days.

	A full 93 per cent of health-care workers employed outside of the long-term care and assisted living system – or 121,048 people – are already fully vaccinated, and another three per cent have had their first shot.

	""Essentially what we're seeing with the 96 per cent mark is a very similar number to what we saw in assisted living and in long-term care,"" Dix noted.

	On Wednesday, the health minister said the province is working with hospitals and facilities to mitigate potential staffing shortages created by the mandate. He also pointed out that COVID-19 outbreaks can be disruptive to staffing levels.

	""When people are off sick from COVID-19 or as contacts of COVID-19, it affects staffing in hospitals as well and continues to do so. So this measure is necessary,"" he said.

	Dr. Bonnie Henry and Dix have both acknowledged that health-care staff are stressed, and in many cases, stretched to the limits.

	Dozens of patients from Northern Health have had to be airlifted to other parts of the province as cases and hospitalizations soar in that region. Experts blame the low levels of immunization in the north.

	According to officials, the region with the highest number of unvaccinated health-care workers is Interior Health (seven per cent), followed by Northern Health (six per cent) and Island Health (five per cent).

	The mandate doesn't apply to the First Nations Health Authority.

	When the vaccine mandate for long-term care and assisted living took effect last week, 1,955 of the 48,879 affected workers across B.C. were unvaccinated, including a number of casual employees.

	If they decide to get vaccinated, they are also welcome to return to work under similar conditions.

	Long-term care homes and assisted living facilities were the first subjected to the mandate because of the deadly consequences seen this year during the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks, blamed in part on the highly contagious Delta variant.

	Officials have noted the bodies of vulnerable seniors and others in care are sometimes less capable of mounting a strong antibody response after vaccination.

	""We know these are settings where transmission causes strain on the system if health-care workers are infected, but also can mean transmission to those who are most vulnerable to severe illness,"" Henry said last week.

	""Few know better than those working in long-term care and assisted living what the impact of COVID-19 has been on our seniors and elders,"" Henry said last week.

	All that meant getting the family tested multiple times.

	Her children, who are five and eight years old, both attend Dartmouth South Academy, which is one of three Nova Scotia schools closed most recently due to mounting COVID-19 exposure warnings.

	The last-minute notice means it's been a scramble for parents juggling work and home.

	""And I think we're all tired and our nerves are frayed,"" says Foster.

	She also feels somewhat fortunate, however, because both she and her husband can work from home. But Foster worries about families who don't have that option when a school suddenly closes.

	""I think a lot about people who don't have that luxury, and if they take a day off they don't get paid,"" says Foster, ""I just don't know how people are doing it.""

	Foster also worries about the fact that she and her husband are vaccinated, while her children are too young.

	It's just one example of the pressure parents are under while trying to keep their children safe and healthy in the ongoing pandemic.

	It's something parent Alva Bourque relates to all too well. Both she and her husband are essential workers, which also means plenty of precautions and testing both inside and outside the home.

	""It is challenging, very, very challenging,"" says Bourque during her lunch break in Halifax.

	With a child in Grade 2, and the other in daycare, Bourque says her family is constantly vigilant about masking, physical distancing, and hand washing.

	She has also been driving her daughter to school instead of using the school bus, to try to cut down on potential close contacts.

	""Both my husband and I are double-vaccinated,"" says Bourque, ""so I feel like we are protecting our children who cannot have the vaccine for now.""

	That's one thing parents like Bourque and Foster hope will change soon, now that Pfizer has officially asked Health Canada to approve its COVID-19 vaccine for children between five and 11 years old.

	""We'll feel a lot better knowing we all have some protection against the virus,"" says Foster.

	""Can it be tomorrow?"" laughs Bourque.

	Health Canada says it will only authorize the Pfizer vaccine if the benefits outweigh any potential health risks for that age group.

	Then, the vaccine must be reviewed by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization.

	After that, it's up to the provinces to determine how to deliver it as quickly as possible.

	""Once we get through those two steps, the vaccine team is already working in detail planning that,"" Dr. Robert Strang explained in Nova Scotia's COVID-19 update Tuesday morning.

	Until all those steps are completed, families like the Fosters and the Bourques will forge ahead as best they can, handling whatever else comes next in the pandemic.

U.S. businesses nervously await fine print of vax-or-test rule,"Oct. 20, 2021 8:36 a.m. CST","
     
     WASHINGTON - 
     
    
	More than six weeks after promising a new vaccination-or-testing rule covering the millions of Americans at companies with 100 or more workers, U.S. President Joe Biden's most aggressive move yet to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is almost ready to see the light of day.

	An obscure White House office is expected to give the green light any day to the rule's fine print detailing how and when companies will have to require their employees to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing.

    Advertisement
    
	The full enforcement deadline, which could carry penalties of about $14,000 per violation, may not take effect until after the new year. That's why Biden and his aides have for weeks encouraged businesses to act as though the rule was already in effect and start imposing vaccination requirements.

	The regulation, to be published in the Federal Register, was drafted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under emergency authorities to protect worker safety and will cover an estimated 80 million U.S. workers. The White House sees it as a potent tool to winnow down the ranks of roughly 65 million Americans who have thus far refused to get a shot.

	Unlike healthcare providers or federal employees, who may not have a testing alternative to vaccination, private sector workers won't necessarily face termination if they don't get vaccinated. But some businesses may choose to impose their own more stringent vaccination mandate, and it's possible that businesses may be allowed to pass on the cost of weekly COVID-19 testing to their unvaccinated employees.

	White House officials declined to discuss when the rule will be published or go into details on when businesses will have to comply.

	For the last week, federal officials have hosted more than two dozen listening sessions with industry groups, businesses and advocacy organizations. Some have been supportive of the rule, others vehemently opposed, but all are eager to learn more about the fine print of the regulation.

	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups that represent large employers are worried that the proposal's threshold --- applying to companies with 100 or more employees -- could cause workers to migrate to jobs at smaller employers where they won't need to be vaccinated.

	""We really stressed the concern about employers losing employees, and what that would mean in the context of current supply-chain challenges and the upcoming holiday season,"" said Marc Freedman, vice president for employment policy at the Chamber of Commerce. ""You could start to see some very serious disruptions.""

	Freedman, who took part in the chamber's call with administration officials, said the 100-worker threshold would also hurt job creation by giving employers who have 90 or 95 employees a reason not to expand.

	The experience of United Airlines and health-care providers that acted early to require vaccination suggests that very few employees will give up their jobs because of a vaccine mandate. United says about 200 of its 67,000 U.S. workers face termination for refusing to get vaccinated and another 2,000 are still seeking medical or religious exemptions.

	State government vaccination mandate deadlines went into effect this week in Washington state, Massachusetts and New Jersey after a host of legal challenges by state employees and first responders' unions.

	In Washington, the state patrol lost 127 employees, including 67 troopers, who left due to the COVID-19 vaccination mandate for state employees, about 6% of the agency's staff, officials said.

	The Northwest state's mandate also led to the high-profile firing of Washington State football coach Nick Rolovich and his four assistants, who wouldn't get vaccinated.

	In Massachusetts, nearly 1,600 state employees had not proved they were vaccinated or had sought a vaccine exemption by a Sunday deadline. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker announced in August that some 44,000 executive branch workers and contractors would be required to get vaccinated or face suspension and ultimately the loss of their jobs.

	The National Association of Manufacturers is arguing that companies should get credit -- perhaps an exemption from the rules -- for taking early steps to get a high percentage of workers vaccinated. Manufacturers have expressed worry that they could see higher quit rates because many plants are located in rural areas where opposition to vaccination is stronger.

	The manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups are also pushing the administration to let employers make unvaccinated workers pay for their own weekly COVID-19 testing.

	""A lot of our members feel strongly that the vaccine is widely available, it is free, and so if a person opts not to be vaccinated potentially the onus of the test can and should fall on the employee who has made a choice not to vaccinate,"" said Robyn Boerstling, a NAM vice president. She said employers should pay for testing if an employee has a medical condition or a ""proven and true"" religious reason for seeking an exemption.

	Business groups, however, are not optimistic on the test-cost issue, saying that OSHA has a history of making employers bear the cost of new regulations.

	Retailers are worried about the timing of the new regulation taking effect as they prepare for the critical holiday season. They want to push the rule's effective date into next year.

	Several people who took part in the discussions with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is doing the final review of the proposal, said they got no hints whether their arguments would sway the administration. They described conference-call meetings --- virtual because of the pandemic --- in which White House staffers listened and did not respond to their arguments.

	It is not clear how the business community will respond once the final rule is published.

	Business officials said legal challenges are more likely to come from Republican-led states such as Texas. And Alfredo Ortiz, president and CEO of the conservative Job Creators Network, reiterated his pledge Tuesday after meeting with the White House officials to sue to block the rule's implementation. Two dozen attorneys general in GOP states vowed last month to use ""every available legal option"" to kill the mandate.

Restaurants will need subsidies to survive winter says industry group,"Oct. 19, 2021 9:02 p.m. CST","
     
     Sault Ste. Marie - 
     
    
	A foodservice industry group is calling for a continuation of wage and rent subsidy programs as restaurants look to rebound from COVID-19 restrictions. Restaurants Canada said eight out of 10 establishments across the country will need help getting through the fall and winter seasons.

	Rebecca Sawyer, manager of Shooters Downstairs Lounge in Sault Ste. Marie, said government subsidies have helped them keep the doors open and their staff employed.

	""Without the wage subsidy program and a number of little supports that we've been able to kind of get our hands into, there's a good chance that we wouldn't even be open right now,"" Sawyer said. ""I do believe that the wage subsidy program going into the new year is almost going to be absolutely necessary, if not closer to the spring.""  Find more Sault area news here

	James Rilett, a vice-president of Restaurants Canada, said the industry in Ontario continues to struggle and that wage and rent subsidies must continue. He said many establishments have taken on a lot of debt over the last 19 months.

	""They're now having to service that debt or pay back bills that had just been put on hold,"" Rilett said. ""So all that is coming due and it just makes profitability in the restaurant sector a delayed thing right now.""

	The industry saw a rebound in the summer, he said, but with patios closing for the season and the vaccine passport system in place, restaurants are once again seeing a drop in sales.

	""When the vaccine passport was brought in, about 60 per cent reported decreased revenue, and 40 per cent say it was significant,"" Rilett said.

	Sawyer agrees, saying the passport system has had an impact on her business.

	""Despite how soon we saw it coming, it's nothing you can really, truly prepare for,"" she said. ""We're dependent on the public to decide that this is what they are willing to participate with and still come out and support restaurants, bars, and the industry as a whole.""

	Even after all public health restrictions come down, Rilett estimates it will take up to 18 months for the industry to fully recover. Sawyer contends it will take even longer given the pandemic's impact on the economy as a whole.

Washington State coach Nick Rolovich fired for refusing COVID-19 vaccine,"Oct. 19, 2021 8:54 p.m. CST","
     
     SPOKANE, Wash. - 
     
    
	Washington State fired football coach Nick Rolovich and four of his assistants on Monday for refusing a state mandate that all employees get vaccinated against COVID-19, making him the first major college coach to lose his job over vaccination status.

	Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, had set a deadline of Monday for thousands of state employees, including the Cougars' coach, to be vaccinated. Rolovich applied for a religious exemption, which was denied Monday, Washington State athletic director Pat Chun said.

	""This is a tough day for Washington State football,"" Chun said at a news conference. ""Nobody wants to be here.""

	Also fired for refusing vaccination were assistant coaches Ricky Logo, John Richardson, Craig Stutzmann and Mark Weber. Chun said there may be no precedent for a team losing its head coach and so many assistants in the middle of a season.

	""Our student-athletes are the biggest losers in this,"" he said.

	Rolovich was not immediately available for comment.

	The 42-year-old Rolovich was the highest-paid state employee with an annual salary of more than US$3 million in a contract that runs through 2025. He had said he wouldn't get vaccinated but wouldn't specify his reasons. He was the only unvaccinated head coach in the Pac-12 and had worn a mask during games.

	Rolovich was fired for cause, which means the university does not have to honour the rest of his contract, although lawsuits over the decision are likely. The Washington State athletic department is currently facing a shortfall of more than $30 million.

	Around the country, many college football coaches have publicly advocated for vaccination, including Clemson's Dabo Swinney and Alabama's Nick Saban. Mississippi coach Lane Kiffin said not getting vaccinated would be irresponsible and bragged about his team being 100% vaccinated.

	Many coaches have talked about their teams' high vaccination rates, though schools are not under any obligation to share those numbers.

	Unlike last season, when COVID-19 cases swept through major college football, postponing and cancelling games weekly, no games have needed to be rescheduled because of a COVID-19 outbreak.

	Rolovich was hired from Hawaii two years ago, after Mike Leach left for Mississippi State, and led Washington State to a 1-3 record in the Pac-12 in a 2020 season cut short because of the pandemic. Washington State has won its past three games and is 4-3 this season, including a 34-31 win over Stanford last Saturday. He finishes with a 5-6 record at the Pullman campus in southeastern Washington.

	Rolovich revealed in July that he would not get vaccinated and couldn't attend Pac-12 media day in person because of it.

	He said in mid-August that he intended to follow the new mandate requiring vaccinations for every state employee but repeatedly declined to say how.

	After refusing for weeks to reveal his plans, Rolovich on Oct. 9 confirmed he was seeking a religious exemption to the mandate. He has not specified his religious beliefs.

	Chun said he met with Rolovich over a period of several months, but could not change the coach's mind.

	""He was resolute in his stance,"" Chun said.

	Rolovich needed to prove a sincerely held religious belief that prevented him from getting vaccinated in his exemption application. The application was put before a committee that reviewed the requests without knowing names of the applicants.

	To continue coaching, Rolovich needed to receive the religious exemption and also to have Chun determine that Rolovich could do his job while keeping the public safe. In addition to his work as a coach, Rolovich oversaw a youth football program and participated in promotional and fundraising events.

	Dickert is in his second season as Washington State's defensive coordinator and came to Pullman after three seasons at Wyoming. He has not previously been a head coach.

	Chun said the school is looking to hire assistants immediately to fill the vacancies on the staff.

	Washington State President Kirk Schulz said nearly 90% of WSU employees and 97% of students had been vaccinated. Fewer than 50 of some 10,000 employees have sought exemptions, Schulz said.

	The vaccine issue has percolated all season, dividing Washington State fans and providing a continual distraction.

	""There was a lot of frustration with such a prominent employee choosing to be unvaccinated,"" Schulz said.

	Players stood up for their coach as the season progressed. Quarterback Jayden de Laura told a sideline reporter after Saturday's win: ""Stop hating on Rolo. We love him.""

	Wide receiver Travell Harris commended Rolovich after the game for being a ""players' coach.""

	""He's a coach we all love to play for,"" Harris said.

"Prospect of no jab, no visa for Australian Open tennis stars","Oct. 19, 2021 5:22 p.m. CST","
     
    
	Tennis players who haven't received a COVID-19 vaccination are unlikely to get a visa to enter the country for the Australian Open in Melbourne in January, according to the political leader of the state which hosts the season-opening major.

	Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews has already introduced a vaccine mandate for professional athletes competing in domestic sports leagues and people working in some industries including health. On Tuesday, he increased the pressure on tennis players traveling from abroad.

	""I don't think any unvaccinated tennis player is going to get a visa to come into this country,"" Andrews said. ""If they did get a visa, they'd probably have to quarantine for a couple of weeks when no other players will have to.

	Australia is preparing to re-open its international borders for the first time in more than 18 months, but it'll be a gradual, state-by-state process starting next month and will depend on vaccination rates across the country. Fully vaccinated people will have fewer restrictions in Australia than those who are not.

	The vaccination debate has been ongoing in tennis since international competition started re-emerging following a global shutdown last year.

	Some players, including men's No. 1 Novak Djokovic, have advocated that the decision to get the vaccine should be a personal choice. Others, including Andy Murray, have said it should be mandated for the good of the majority.

	At the U.S. Open, which ended Sept. 12, spectators had to show proof of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine to attend matches, although players weren't required to get a shot.

	Victoria Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion and three-time runner-up at the U.S. Open, thought that sent a mixed message. She reached the U.S. Open final in 2020, when there were no fans allowed.

	""To me that's a bit bizarre that fans have to be vaccinated and players are not,"" Azarenka said. ""So I think that in my opinion, it's inevitable that it will be mandated at some point, like other leagues are doing.""

	Both the men's and the women's tours are recommending all players get vaccinated but so far have not enforced it. Just before the U.S. Open, roughly half of the elite male and female players were vaccinated.

	Ahead of the Australian Open earlier this year, all players had to quarantine for two weeks and be regularly tested under Australia's strict regulations on COVID-19 measures.

	Most were allowed a limited time to practice, but any who tested positive or we deemed to be close contacts of a positive case -- which in some cases meant simply being on the same charter flight -- had to do a hard lockdown. Those players weren't allowed to leave their hotel rooms.

	Melbourne, which hosts season-opening Formula One Grand Prix races, the richest horse race in the southern hemisphere and the biggest football crowd in Australia, has either barred crowds or shifted sports events interstate during months of lockdown in recent months.

Experts caution numbers of fully-vaccinated in hospital present 'skewed' version of reality,"Oct. 19, 2021 10:19 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
     On the surface, the numbers appear alarming.  During first two weeks of October, statistics from the BC Centre for Disease Control show nearly a quarter of people hospitalized for COVID-19 in the province were fully vaccinated. 
    Advertisement
     That appears to be sharply higher than just a month earlier.

But experts say to understand what the numbers actually mean about your risk of a breakthrough case that lands you in hospital, you have to look at rates within the population, rather than the raw data.  “It exists only because so much more of the population is vaccinated,” said cardiologist and epidemiologist Dr. Christopher Labos.  “So when you just look at the raw numbers, you get a skewed version of reality,” Labos said.  Labos explained that because vaccines aren’t a perfect “shield” against infection, as more and more British Columbians are fully vaccinated, more and more will become infected with COVID-19 and end up hospitalized.  “Over time we should fully expect that the percentage of people in hospital that are fully vaccinated is going to go up, because there’s just going to be more of them,” Labos said.​  Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, pointed out that those that are older and also at risk of disease are over-represented within the doubled-dosed group, which means the data has to be age adjusted to create a true picture of risk.  “When we adjust things for age, it reassures me, it is affecting those who we knew to be at risk of serious disease since the beginning of the pandemic,” Conway said.  Taking the same data from the first two weeks of October, the hospitalization rate for those fully vaccinated is 2.3 people for every 100,000.  The rate for those partially vaccinated is 10.4 people for every 100,000.  And for those not yet vaccinated, it soars to 51.3.  Put another way, and widening out to cover the span of a month, data from the BCCDC shows those who are unvaccinated are roughly 10 times more likely to be infected with COVID-19, 52 times more likely to be hospitalized, and 44 times more likely to die, than British Columbians who are fully vaccinated.  “The vaccines clearly and unequivocally have helped reduce the rates of COVID-19,” Lobos said.  A recent analysis from the BCCDC found two doses of any COVID-19 vaccine was approximately 95 per cent effective against hospitalization.  Even so, Conway expressed concern over his expectation that both older people and those more at-risk for serious disease will continue to account for an increasing proportion of serious COVID-19 cases.    “We need to vaccinate the unvaccinated as soon as we can. We need to consider third shots in more people in a targeted way,” Conway said, adding that arguments could be made for offering a booster to anyone 65 years or older, or those those had their second dose at least six months ago.  Last Thursday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry noted her team was watching breakthrough cases carefully, and digging through new data and evidence around who should be getting boosters next.  “We’ll have more to say about that soon, but that is the one of the things we’re looking at in some detail,” Henry said.

Half of Canadian parents plan to get their young kids vaccinated against COVID-19: poll,"Oct. 18, 2021 11:00 p.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	It appears half of Canadian and the majority of B.C. parents are anxious to get their young kids vaccinated against COVID-19.

	Results from a new survey from the Angus Reid Institute suggests strong support to get shots in the arms of five to 11-year-olds as soon as possible.

	According to the data, half of Canadian parents say they plan to vaccinate their elementary school-aged children as soon as a vaccine is available to them.

	Eighteen per cent said they would get their kids inoculated eventually and 23 per cent said they will not be getting their kids vaccinated.

	The percentage of parents opposed to the kids' vaccine is lower in B.C., sitting at 15 per cent, according to the survey.

	The poll's results suggested support for adolescent vaccination is higher among parents with a university education and those with higher incomes.

	There is currently no vaccine approved for kids under the age of 12 in Canada, though Pfizer recently submitted data suggesting its vaccine is safe for kids aged five to 11.

	COVID-19 cases have spiked in B.C. schools since kids returned to class last month.

	However, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has maintained the risk of serious illness from the virus is relatively low in kids.

	B.C. is allowing parents to register kids for their first jab, but one public policy expert says there hasn’t been sufficient messaging about COVID vaccinations in children.

	“I'd love to see more age specific registration. We could also do really basic things like get schools to send letters to all the parents with kids between the ages of five and 11, so they actually know this registration is happening,” said Heidi Tworek, a professor of public policy at the University of British Columbia.

	Tworek says parents need to be provided with enough information to make an informed decision.

	“We need to explain to parents how the approval process is functioning and how is this vaccine different than the vaccine for over 12 so they can feel confident in registering their kids and having them vaccinated as soon as the vaccine might be approved,” Tworek told CTV News.

	THIRD DOSES

	The survey also revealed an appetite for a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine among most vaccinated Canadians.

	Sixty-two per cent of those surveyed said they would take the shot right away if it were offered, while another 20 per cent said they would get an additional dose eventually but would be in no rush.

	“Vaccine hesitancy has diminished month by month since the rollout began in the early parts of 2021. Currently just one-in-12 Canadian adults currently say they haven’t been vaccinated,” a statement from the Angus Reid Institute said.

	Booster shots have been offered in Canada in a limited capacity so far.

	In B.C, people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised may be able get a third dose four weeks after their second one.

	Those who are eligible will be contacted through the province's Get Vaccinated system.

	Residents of long-term care and assisted living centres are also being offered an additional dose six months after their second dose.

	The survey found the willingness to get a booster dose was also influenced by political ideology.

	“Past Conservative and Bloc Québécois voters who have been vaccinated are much less likely than those who recently supported the Liberals and NDP to say that they would immediately receive a booster,” said the institute's statement.

	DOUBT OF A RETURN TO NORMAL

	At the start of the pandemic, a poll conducted by the Institute showed few respondents thought that COVID-19 would impact their lives longer than six months, but doubt that a return to normal is near is growing.

	“Currently, the largest group of Canadians (37 per cent) say that Canada will never return to the way that it was before February 2020,” read a summary of the survey.

	That’s roughly double the number of people who shared the view last year.

	Personal concern over contracting the virus also rose in the last month.

	“Three-in-five (57 per cent) Canadians are very or moderately concerned about being infected, a decline from a peak of 71 per cent at the beginning of the year, but a climb from a summer valley of 47 per cent.”

	The institute conducted the online surveys from Sept. 29 to Oct. 3, 2021, among a representative randomized sample of 5,011 Canadian adults who are members of Angus Reid Forum.

	For comparison purposes only, a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

	The survey was self-commissioned and paid for by ARI.

	Ten of the latest victims lived in the Fraser Health region, while five each lived in the Interior Health and Northern Health regions, and three each lived in the Vancouver Coastal Health and Island Health regions.

	Fraser Health also recorded the highest number of cases over the weekend, with 737, though it's worth noting the health authorities have vastly different populations. Northern Health's 406 cases translates to 142.8 infections per 100,000 population, compared to 38.6 infections per 100,000 population in Fraser Health.

	Vancouver Coastal Health saw the lowest rate of infection, with 17.8 cases per 100,000 population.

	The number of infectious COVID-19 patients in hospital, which hasn't dipped below 300 since mid-September, decreased slightly to 360, including 151 in intensive care.

	Once again, the government's statistics indicate the majority of B.C.'s cases and hospitalizations involve people who are either unvaccinated against COVID-19 or only partially vaccinated.

	""88 per cent of those in critical care today due to COVID-19 were not fully vaccinated,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix said on Twitter.

	The unvaccinated account for 86 per cent of coronavirus-positive patients in ICU, including 25 of the 26 patients who are under the age of 40. They also account for 68 per cent of all cases recorded across the province over the past two weeks.

	

	

	The numbers are particularly striking given that the unvaccinated make up a small minority of British Columbians, accounting for less than 20 per cent of the population, including the young children who are currently ineligible for any of the approved vaccines.

	According to the Ministry of Health, the unvaccinated were infected at a rate of 268 cases per 100,000 people from Oct. 8 to 14, compared to 29.4 cases per 100,000 people among the fully vaccinated.

	As of Monday, 89.2 per cent of those eligible have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 83.4 per cent have received both. More than eight million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered across B.C. so far, with some of those going to non-residents.

	Officials also announced four new COVID-19 outbreaks in health-care facilities, at Queens Park Centre in New Westminster, Heritage Village in Chilliwack, Menno Terrace West in Abbotsford, and Amica Lions Gate in West Vancouver. Another outbreak at Joseph Creek Care Village ended, leaving 22 active outbreaks across B.C.'s health-care system.

Mandatory PCR test remains barrier for travellers as U.S. reopens borders to Canada,"Oct. 16, 2021 9:34 a.m. CST","
     
     Victoria - 
     
    
	On Nov. 8, the land and sea borders will open up again for Canadians wanting to visit the U.S. The question is, will anyone make the trip?

	""We’d love to go back down,"" said Vancouver Island resident Harry Little.

    Advertisement
    
	But, there’s a catch.

       Victoria Clipper suspends service to U.S. until 2022U.S. says it will permit entry of Canadian travellers with mixed vaccine doses Canada-U.S. will reopen land border to fully vaccinated visitors in November

	""It’s probably going to be easy to get down but coming back is going to be the problem,"" said Little. ""If it’s going to be really difficult we won’t be doing any travelling.""

	The fact that Canada will still require proof of a negative PCR test within 72 hours of re-entry into the country is a common concern. That COVID-19 test starts at $129 and increases in price, depending on how fast you need the results.

	""You don’t want to pay an extra $150 for a shopping trip or something like that, you know what I mean?” said islander Duncan Rumak.

	""It’s basically the reason we decided not to do our annual trip,"" said Ben Rumak.

	That test has the Black Ball Ferry Line, which operates the Coho Ferry between Victoria and Port Angeles, questioning if it’s even worth starting up again.

	""It’s a difficult thing, no doubt about it,"" said Ryan Burles, president of the Black Ball Ferry Line.

	""We don’t know whether the PCR is here to stay for two months or six months,"" he said. ""That’s a big hurdle.""

	Burles knows there will be demand from snowbirds wanting to head south for the winter. But that business is not enough to sustain the operating costs of the ferry.

	The company said on Friday that it is going to take the weekend to decide if it’s worth starting up again.

	South of the border in Port Angeles, Washington, excitement is high, but locals know they’re not going to see many Canadian visitors until the Coho Ferry begins to run again. So expectations are tempered for now until that PCR test is gone from the equation.

	""Once that PCR test is gone, I think we’re going to see a true opening of the border,"" said Marc Abshire, executive director of the Port Angeles Chamber of Commerce.

	The mayor of Port Angeles agrees.

	""It sounds like one of the big issues on the Canadian side is also the PCR,"" said Kate Dexter, Mayor of Port Angeles. ""So, yes, if the Coho’s running it means there’s no PCR test likely and so I’m hopeful that we will see Canadians.""

	As a bit of a loophole, Canadians could get tested in Canada and if they are returning within 72 hours, they could use those results to get back into the country.

	One last big question was cleared up on Friday evening, when U.S. officials confirmed that Canadians who received mixed vaccine doses would be considered fully vaccinated.

	So come Nov. 8, many Canadians may just decide to stay home until crossing the border becomes less cumbersome and less expensive.

	""It isn’t worth the hassle,"" said Judy Little. ""We’ll wait until they straighten it all out. So for now, no.""

Sask. reveals rough timeline for COVID-19 vaccine approval for children between ages 5 to 11 ,"Oct. 16, 2021 8:18 a.m. CST","
     
     SASKATOON - 
     
    
	The provincial government has given an expected date for when vaccines for children between 5 and 11.

	The province’s top doctor Dr. Saqib Shahab says Pfizer has submitted a request to give a lower dose vaccine to children aged 5 to 11.

    Advertisement
    
	“Vaccines may be available by November and I think many provinces are looking forward to that,"" said Shahab, “we are looking forward with anticipation that vaccine for 5 to 11-year-old's will be approved by Health Canada by November.”

	Shahab specified there is no firm timeline in place just yet.

	Lea Corpuz is a mother to three children under the age of 11 and for her, the news of approved vaccines is welcoming.

	“I’m so happy if the vaccine will come so my kids are safer and I won’t have to worry about COVID at school,” said Corpuz.

	She says it would remove the hassle of having to test her children for COVID-19.

	“I have to swab test them because there is somebody at school (who has) coronavirus.”

	According to the province, about a third of cases are coming from school aged children. Cory Neudorf, Saskatchewan Health Authority Interim Senior Medical Officer, says getting children vaccinated could help push the province to achieve an 85 to 95 per cent overall vaccination rate.

	“Including children in that age category as eligible for immunization, it just really helps to increase immunity for our province,” said Neudorf.

	Neudorf says parents should have no concerns over giving children vaccines if it is approved by Health Canada.

	“With these vaccines, they find the lowest effective dose possible so that kids don’t have unnecessary side effects.”

     KITCHENER - 
     
    
	As Premier Doug Ford awaits the response from hospital CEOs across Ontario regarding their thoughts on a vaccine policy for staff, local hospitals are adjusting to the mandate already implemented.

	The mandatory COVID-19 vaccine policy went into effect for Waterloo Region and Wellington County hospitals on Wednesday, resulting in hundreds of staff being placed on unpaid leaves.

	Grand River Hospital in Kitchener initially put 170 staff and physicians on leave, but CEO Ron Gagnon says that number has since dropped to 124.

	“It shows you the impact of having this policy, because those numbers continue to come down,” he said. “Yesterday there was even some of that group who have now stepped forward and are getting their first vaccination, so that’s great.”

	Over at St. Mary’s in Kitchener, 27 staff are on unpaid leave, 51 at Cambridge Memorial, and 31 at Guelph General.

	“It made me feel very sad,” said Dr. Nicola Mercer, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph’s Medical Officer of Health. “These are good, well-paying jobs, and for people who have often been in these institutions for some time.”

	On Friday, Ford issued a letter to hospital CEO’s asking their input on the policies, which are not province-wide.

	“I’m going to continue to preach that I want every single health care worker to get vaccinated,” he said. “People have to look at the ramifications down the road, where are we going to be in two or three months when they’re short tens of thousands of people, nurses, and doctors?”

	Gagnon says the shortage of workers has led to one less operating room at Grand River.

	“We have come down one operating room,” he said. “We were operating one additional room compared to what we normally do, so we are back to our normal.

	“I continue to be 100 per cent confident we are following the right approach when it comes to protecting our staff, protecting our community, and protecting our patients.”

	Ford is asking all hospitals to respond to his letter by next Tuesday.

	Two of the deaths were in the Interior Health region and the other 11 were in Fraser Health.

	The province also reported one new COVID-19 outbreak at a health-care facility. That outbreak, at GR Baker Memorial Hospital in Quesnel, is in the province’s Northern Health region. The rural region is seeing high COVID-19 case spread and its intensive care units have been overwhelmed.

	One COVID-19 outbreak, at Good Samaritan Delta View Care Centre in Fraser Health authority, was declared over. There are 19 other active outbreaks in health-care settings, according to the ministry.

	The new cases means there are now 5,128 active cases of COVID-19. Of the active cases, 367 people are in hospital, 152 of whom are in intensive care. The number of people in B.C. who have recovered from COVID-19 is now 188,851.

	As of Friday, 89 per cent of eligible people 12 and older in B.C. have received their first dose, the same percentage reported on Thursday. Despite the fact that the percentage remains the same, an additional 3,314 people received their first dose of the vaccine over the one-day period – it just wasn’t enough to bump the percentage count up. And, 83.7 per cent of eligible residents have received two doses, an increase from 82.9 per cent on Thursday.

	Of the new cases, 246 are in Fraser Health, 184 are in Northern Health, 75 in Vancouver Coastal Health, and 59 in Island Health, and 101 in Interior Health.

	Notably, however, Fraser Health has more than six times the population of Northern Health, meaning the northern region added far more cases per capita than Fraser Health – or the province’s other three health regions.

	To address the spread of COVID-19 in Northern Health, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced new restrictions on Thursday as the region’s hospitals were overwhelmed.

	As of Friday, personal gatherings – whether indoor or outdoor – are restricted to fully vaccinated people in parts of Northern B.C.

	""If you are unvaccinated or have unvaccinated people in your households, then you need to stay with your household only,"" Henry said when speaking to the Northern Health measures.

"Nova Scotia introduces legislation prohibiting anti-vaccine protests near hospitals, pharmacies","Oct. 16, 2021 3:49 a.m. CST","
     
     HALIFAX - 
     
    
	Protests that block access to hospitals and other health-care facilities could soon be banned in Nova Scotia under newly proposed legislation.

	The Progressive Conservative government tabled the Protecting Access to Health Services Act Thursday, which it said would also ban protests at the homes of patients who receive care where they live.

    Advertisement
    
	Premier Tim Houston said the legislation would establish a 50-metre ""safe access bubble"" around hospitals and other facilities such as doctors' offices, where protests would not be permitted.
        RELATED STORIES
       Quebec swiftly passes new bill to prohibit anti-vaccine protests near schools, hospitalsNova Scotia's modified phase five reopening met with mixed reaction

	""Health-care workers have disproportionately been through a lot with the pandemic,"" Houston told reporters. ""This is all designed to make sure that our health-care professionals know that their government supports them in having a safe and healthy workplace.""

	The premier added that while people have a right to protest, they can't be allowed to disrupt access to health care. ""There are places where (protesting) should be done and there are places where that should not be done,"" he said.

	Nova Scotia joins Quebec, which adopted a law banning COVID-19-related protests outside schools and hospitals. Quebec's law, however, must be renewed every 30 days for it to remain in effect, and it expires when the government lifts the pandemic-related state of emergency. Alberta, meanwhile, recently announced it was adding hospitals, clinics and other health-care facilities to a list of essential infrastructure protected under an anti-blockade law.

	The Nova Scotia legislation, which is not limited to the province's current pandemic-related state of emergency, comes in the wake of several protests against COVID-19 measures that were held outside health facilities across the country in September. Houston said his government's bill is largely in direct response to those and other health-related protests.

	""Certainly that's front and centre in my mind ΓÇª but who knows what the issue might be in the future,"" he said.

	And although Houston said the 50-metre buffer would also apply to union picket lines outside hospitals, there doesn't appear to be a specific reference to labour unions in the language of the bill. The government said Thursday that peaceful protests would still be allowed outside health-care facilities as long as they are outside the buffer zone.

	Liberal Leader Iain Rankin and NDP Leader Gary Burrill both expressed support for the idea behind the legislation, but they said they needed to evaluate the bill further before staking a position.

"'Another tragically high total': Alberta reports 30 deaths, 916 new COVID-19 cases","Oct. 15, 2021 8:43 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON -

       Hinshaw apologizes after Alberta mistakenly reports 14-year-old's cancer death was caused by COVID-19COVID-19 in Alberta: 38 deaths, 652 new cases on Wednesday

	Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the deaths reported Thursday were from Oct. 7 to 13, and that the majority of people were unvaccinated.

	“This is another tragically high total,” she said. “The high number of fatalities that we have seen recently are the result of rapid spread.

	“This is another reason why we all need to keep limiting in-person contact and driving cases downward.”

	The 30 deaths reported Thursday raised the pandemic total to 2,930. All the newly reported deaths were from people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, except for three between the ages of 50 and 60.

	

	

	There are now 1,016 Albertans in hospital with COVID-19, including 231 in ICU. Sixty-seven people were hospitalized on Thursday, driven primarily by those aged 60 to 69, 50 to 59, and 40 to 49.

	

			A Flourish chart


	In a statement to CTV News, Alberta Health Services (AHS) said it continues to do all it can to ensure ICU capacity can meet patient demand.

	'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC'

	As of 2 p.m. Thursday, there are 372 total ICU beds in the province, with 282 full.

	“While the number of patients in ICU fluctuates constantly, the number of patients in ICU has decreased by five per cent over the past seven days,” AHS said in a statement.

	The North Zone has the highest amount of ICU capacity filled. As of Thursday afternoon, it was operating at 84 per cent.

	The South Zone has 83 per cent capacity filled, while ICU capacity in the Edmonton Zone is operating at 76 per cent. ICU capacity in the Central and Calgary zones was at 75 and 72 per cent, respectively.

	Nineteen more people were admitted to ICUs on Thursday, mostly driven by those aged 60 to 69 and 70 to 79. One admission was of an Albertan between the ages of five and nine years old.

	

	

	“This is a significant improvement from just one month ago when our ICUs were close to 90 per cent occupancy, including the surge capacity, and the number of ICU patients was increasing rapidly each day,” said Dr. Verna Yiu, AHS CEO and president.

	According to Yiu, the average number of ICU patients admitted in Alberta has reduced from more than 20 a day to about 13 to 15.

	“This is still a high number because these admissions are preventable,” Yiu added. “We are grateful that the numbers appear to be falling.

	“But we know that this trend can be reversed easily, especially if we become complacent, and we remain uncertain as to the potential impact of the Thanksgiving weekend.”

	Yiu said surgical teams are carefully planning to increase the amount of procedures offered again in hospitals in the province, but that there is “no timeline” for a return to normal surgical volumes.

	On Wednesday, Alberta Health reported 38 COVID-19 deaths and 652 new cases.

	Just over 85 per cent of eligible Albertans have one vaccine dose and 76.2 per cent have two.

	INFLUENZA SEASON

	With the arrival of colder temperatures, Hinshaw said it is important everyone receive their annual flu shot.

	“While influenza and COVID-19 are very different illnesses, several of the symptoms are the same,” she said.

	The majority of measures that help limit the spread of COVID-19, like increased handwashing and sanitization, and physical distancing, are effective against influenza, she said.

	“We don’t need to look further than the last influenza season for proof of that,” Hinshaw said.

	“Despite conducting about 2.5 times the number of influenza tests as we did the previous year, we had zero lab confirmed cases of seasonal influenza and no influenza deaths.”

	This year, Hinshaw said there have already been three lab confirmed influenza cases. She urged Albertans to get their flu shot once they become available.

	Last year the province saw the highest amount of flu shots administered in the past 10 years, with more than 1.65 million doses administered.

	Every Albertan over the age of six months can is eligible to receive a free annual influenza vaccination at a pharmacy or some doctor offices. 

	“Influenza remains a serious and deadly virus,” she added. “To ease the system strain caused by increased demand for COVID-19 and influenza testing, I urge every eligible Albertan to get the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines as soon as you are able to.

	“This will greatly reduce the number of people who get infected and the number of symptomatic people who need to be tested.”

	Hinshaw said that scientific and medical reviews determined it is safe for people to receive both their COVID-19 vaccine and influenza vaccine at the same time.

	More information about Alberta’s influenza campaign and flu shots is expected to be released in the coming days.

"Dozens of local hospital staff members, including nurses, on unpaid leave over vaccine policy","Oct. 15, 2021 7:13 a.m. CST","
     
     Barrie, Ont. - 
     
    
	Forty-five staff members at Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre (RVH) face termination from Simcoe County's largest hospital because they are not double vaccinated against COVID-19.

	Janice Skot, RVH President and CEO, says the unvaccinated employees, about half of which are nurses, were put on unpaid leave last week.

	Those employees have until Oct. 31 to be vaccinated, or they will lose their jobs.  Children 5 to 11 approved to get COVID-19 vaccine as cases surge in Simcoe MuskokaSMDHU adds new safety measures as COVID-19 cases surge and death toll climbsInfectious disease expert addresses most common pandemic questions Vaccine mandates leave dozens of Simcoe County workers out of a job'I just couldn't believe it,' Friends shocked by vaccinated Oro-Medonte man's deathOnt. health unit warns rapid antigen tests are not to be used to diagnose COVID-19Does your child have COVID-19 symptoms? Here's what Simcoe Muskoka parents need to know

	""We're really optimistic that of those people who are currently home on an unpaid leave of absence will continue to reflect on the importance of safety for everyone,"" Skot says.

	""In this pandemic, we know that vaccination is the safest way to ensure that we have a safe work environment and safety for our patients,"" she adds.

	Another 14 unvaccinated employees have been dismissed for refusing to submit to twice-weekly testing mandated by the province.

	Skot says several casual part-time workers are among the suspended and terminated groups and stresses that 99 per cent of the hospital's 3,500 staff and contractors are fully vaccinated.

	The transition comes at the same time as a sign at RVH's entrance warns that emergency department wait times are longer than usual and asks for patience.

	Skot concedes suspensions and terminations over-vaccination status could be playing a role in longer than usual wait times in the hospital's emergency department, though she adds that the volume of patients coming in has also increased.

	Skot says RVH is ""continuously"" hiring nurses and other staff members, with 80 new recruits welcomed last week.

	""We are committed to ensuring that the public continues to receive the care that they deserve and they expect at RVH,"" she notes.

	RVH and Orillia Soldiers' Memorial Hospital are among 14 central region health care signatories to a joint COVID-19 staff vaccination policy.

	Soldiers' Memorial has terminated two employees who refused to submit to regular testing and suspended 16 people among its staff of 1,500 who aren't vaccinated.

	President and CEO Carmine Stumpo explains that the hospital has been leaning on its vaccinated physicians, midwives, and dentists to answer questions, dispel myths, and attempt to break through vaccine hesitancy.

	""We really want to work with our staff to get to that 100 per cent compliance. That's what's going to keep us safe, it's going to keep our community safe, and that has always been our intention,"" he says.

	SEIU Healthcare, which represents thousands of staff at Simcoe County hospitals, has endorsed mandatory COVID-19 vaccines as a matter of safety.

	But union president Sharleen Stewart sees them as highlighting an existing staffing shortage crisis.

	""The unvaccinated obviously are adding to the numbers, but there many vaccinated frontline workers who are leaving the profession,"" Stewart says.

	She points to poor working conditions, workplace violence and insufficient pay as some of the factors driving healthcare workers to make a change.

	The province says those booking will need to meet the definition for moderately to severely immunocompromised, and vaccine clinics will review the patients information to ensure they meet the definition or are on one of the eligible medications. Those who do not qualify will not be given a third dose. More information is available on the province’s website.

	The province also announced that third doses will be made available to people who need to travel for work to meet entry requirements or avoid isolation in a country that does not recognize mixed doses.

	“The decision by some countries not to recognize mixed doses has created financial hardship for people whose job requires them to travel,” says the release.

	To become eligible for a third dose for work-related travel, applicants must:

	
		be a Nova Scotia resident
	
		provide an official copy of proof of vaccination for each of the two doses received
	
		provide written confirmation from their employer that they are required to travel to a country as part of their job and that country does not accept a mixed-vaccine series
	
		provide official confirmation or documentation from the country or location of travel that a mixed-vaccine series does not permit entry or requires isolation upon entry.


	Work-related third doses must be applied for by AdminINS@novascotia.ca with the necessary information, and cannot be booked online or by phone.

	The province says applicants will hear back within seven business days if they are approved, and receive details on scheduling an appointment.

Sask. healthcare system 'creaking' amid fourth wave,"Oct. 14, 2021 4:31 a.m. CST","
     
     SASKATOON - 
     
    
	Healthcare workers in Saskatchewan are having to choose who gets appropriate critical care and which patients will receive care on the hospital floor.

	It’s a glimpse into what the current COVID-19 situation looks like in the province.

    Advertisement
    
	“The system is creaking, we’re at the level of the pandemic where it is really taxing our system,” said Dr. John Froh, deputy chief medical health officer with the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA).

Saskatoon police issuing tickets in connection to mostly-maskless PPC election night partySask. premier's approval down 20 points as COVID-19 hammers province: surveySaskatoon restaurant owner finds lack of provincial mandate on proof of vaccination for staff 'confusing'

	“It’s shuddering under the burden and the burden will grow.”

	Froh’s commentary came during the SHA’s weekly physician town hall on Oct. 7.

	Froh said Saskatchewan is well into the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the surge in cases is being driven by the Delta variant.

	Saskatchewan’s ICU pressures have the healthcare system moving from the yellow to red zone, he said.

	That means the limited healthcare staff are providing substandard care for patients in critical need and/or at risk of death, more service slowdowns, an increase in preventable deaths and the possibility of transporting ICU patients out of province, he said.

	“We continue to grow in terms of cases and we haven’t turned a corner.""

	The physician town hall offered some bleak predictions when it comes to ICU admissions in the coming weeks.

	As of the town hall on Oct. 7, the SHA reported the total number of ICU patients across the province at 114, of which 79 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19.

	SHA projections show ICU capacity for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients could exceed 115 beds by Sunday - and the province could eclipse 125 ICU beds by Oct. 24.

	“I know we’ll be sending patients out of province,” said Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Susan Shaw.

	The province broke records each day last week in terms of new cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions.

	Shaw noted one patient is receiving care on the hospital floor, hooked up to high-flow oxygen.

	“I know they’re getting excellent care on the floor but it’s not the standard we want to provide,” Shaw said.

	Shaw said the possibility of Saskatchewan’s healthcare system moving towards triage protocols is becoming more real.

	“I'm finding it hard to find a path that doesn't get us there,” Shaw said.

	She also noted with Saskatchewan adding 450 new COVID-19 cases every day, many will need care in a hospital.

	“And a percentage of those are going to need ICU,” she said.

	The physician town hall also heard how 55 per cent of patients with COVID-19 had their first diagnosis with a test in the emergency room or ICU.

	“So we don't have a window to do a lot of early intervention,” Shaw said.

	On the immunization front, 80.1 per cent of eligible Saskatchewan residents have received a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, last among the provinces.

	74.9 per cent have received two vaccines, the second-lowest mark in Canada, just ahead of Alberta.

"Sarnia, Ont., mayor welcomes planned U.S. land border reopening","Oct. 14, 2021 1:53 a.m. CST","
     
     Toronto, Ont. - 
     
    
	The mayor of an Ontario border city welcomed the news that fully vaccinated Canadians will be able to drive into the United States starting next month, but said more details are needed to ensure travellers can go back and forth between the two countries safely.

	Sarnia Mayor Mike Bradley said Wednesday that he believes Canadians will be cautious about driving south for day trips given that some parts of the U.S. have looser public health measures and higher COVID-19 case counts — a concern he said also emerged when Canada eased its border restrictions for Americans earlier this year.

    Advertisement
    
	""I do believe the Canadian government made a mistake by opening our border without getting a reciprocal arrangement with the Americans. It's four months later, but it's happening, and it's a good thing,'' he said.

	""I just need to make sure that all the things will be in place to protect people when they go there and come back,'' the mayor said.

	""I do not see a lot of people wanting to go over on day tripping for some time to come because of what's happening in places like Michigan and elsewhere, where there re no restrictions on masking and gathering and things like that.''

	Senior government officials delivered news of the land border reopening to reporters on condition that they hold reports until early Wednesday, but the plan was announced by New York congressman Brian Higgins late Tuesday.

	Few details have been released so far, but the plan is designed to dovetail with the Biden administration's intention to allow international travellers from further afield to resume travel to the U.S. on the same timeline, provided they've been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

	In order to be considered fully vaccinated, travellers must have received a full course of a COVID-19 vaccine approved by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization. That includes Oxford-AstraZeneca, a vaccine used in Canada that never received FDA approval.

	It's not yet known whether those who received mixed doses will be deemed eligible.

	No specific dates have been set for the changes to take effect. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is expected to lay out more details of the plan today.

	Travel between the U.S., Canada and Mexico by vehicle, rail and ferry has been largely restricted to essential travel, such as trade, since the early days of the global health crisis.

	Fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents have been allowed back into Canada since August, provided they have waited at least 14 days since getting a full course of a Health Canada-approved vaccine and can show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test.

	Beginning in early November, the U.S. plans to allow fully vaccinated visitors from a host of countries, including China, India, Ireland, Iran, South Africa, Brazil and the 26 European countries without border controls, known as the Schengen group.

	TUESDAY ANNOUNCEMENTS

	Earlier Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry spoke at a live news conference.

	The health officials announced that children between the ages of five and 11 are now required to wear masks in indoor public spaces effective immediately.

	B.C.'s top doctor also said that the province was preparing its plans to vaccinate children in this age group, if COVID-19 vaccines are approved for use in kids by Health Canada.

	Meanwhile, both Henry and Dix urged all British Columbians, particularly people living in the Northern Health region, to get vaccinated.

	B.C.'s health minister described the situation in Northern Health as ""very serious,"" noting that dozens of people have been transferred out of hospitals in the region for critical care in recent weeks.

	Dix says that out of the past 55 recent transfers, 43 of the patients were being treated for COVID-19, and 42 of those people were not fully vaccinated.

	""For those people walking around unvaccinated who might be in those critical care beds in two or three weeks, now is the time to get vaccinated,"" he said.

	Health officials added that vaccinations help reduce the severity of the illness if you contract COVID-19, and help protect vulnerable people who may not be able to receive a vaccine themselves, such as young children.

	Dix noted that patients in the Northern Health region had to be flown ""hundreds and hundreds of kilometres,"" to reach hospitals in other health regions, including Island Health, which can add stress to families, patients and health-care systems across the province.

	As of Tuesday, 88.8 per cent of people aged 12 and older had received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in B.C., while 82.6 per cent of eligible people have received two doses.

	Health officials say there is community spread in the Central zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.

	Public Health says it is closely monitoring all four health zones for community spread.

	EXPOSURE NOTICES FOR EIGHT HALIFAX AREA SCHOOLS

	Health officials also sent exposure notices for eight schools in the Halifax Regional Municipality on Tuesday.

	The latest school exposures are at École Mer et Monde, École Beaubassin, Halifax West High, Chebucto Heights Elementary and Joesph Howe Elementary in Halifax, Dartmouth South Academy and Ian Forsyth Elementary in Dartmouth, and Seaside Elementary in Eastern Passage.

	“It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious,” said N.S. Health in a release.

	A list of schools with exposures is available online.

	COVID-19 CASE DATA

	Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 4,138 tests on Oct. 8; 3,275 tests on Oct. 9; 2,497 tests on Oct.  10; and 2,334 tests on Oct. 11.

       Brooklyn Nets statement on Kyrie Irving, Oct. 12, 2021

	Irving hasn't said he isn't vaccinated, asking for privacy when he spoke via Zoom during the team's media day on Sept. 27.

	But he had rarely been with the team in New York, where a mandate requires professional athletes playing for a team in the city have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to play or practice in public venues.

	""Kyrie's made it clear that he has a choice in this matter and it's ultimately going to be up to him what he decides,"" general manager Sean Marks said. ""We respect the fact that he has a choice, he can make his own and right now what's best for the organization is the path that we're taking.""

	Teams aren't allowed to reveal private details of players' health. But asked Tuesday if Irving was vaccinated, Marks said: ""If he was vaccinated, we wouldn't be having this discussion. I think that's probably pretty clear.""

	Marks said he and owner Joe Tsai together made the decision, adding that it came through discussions with Irving and his associates.

	""Kyrie loves to play basketball, wants to be out there, wants to be participating with his teammates,"" Marks said. ""But again, this is a choice that Kyrie had and he was well aware of that.""

	Irving wasn't even eligible to practice with the Nets in New York until Friday, when the city told the team that its training facility was considered a private venue.

	Irving then joined the team at an outdoor practice Saturday and worked out with the Nets on Sunday, but didn't play in Brooklyn's exhibition game at Philadelphia on Monday.

	Coach Steve Nash had said that the Nets knew they were going to be missing Irving for some games. For now, at least, it will be all of them.

	With Kevin Durant, James Harden and Irving, the Nets were considered a favorite to win the NBA title. They were eliminated by the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round of last season's playoffs after Irving sprained his ankle and missed the final three games.

	Marks conceded that the Nets weren't as strong without Irving, though they may still be good enough.

	""At this point in time, the Nets have more than enough to win a championship,"" said Richard Jefferson, a former Nets star who now works for YES Network. ""I think adding Kyrie makes them, in my opinion, a heavy favorite and that's just kind of is what it is. With Kyrie this team can win 55, 60 games. Without Kyrie, this team could still win 55 games.""

	Marks wouldn't predict how long Irving would be away from the team or get into whether the Nets would consider trying to trade him.

	""The hope is that we have Kyrie back,"" Marks said. ""We'll welcome him back in open arms under a different set of circumstances and so we need to wait and see how that transpires. But in the meantime, we need to focus on the 16 players that are going to be on this roster moving forward with us.""

	NBA players are not required to be vaccinated, but they face more testing and restrictions on their ability to be around their teammates. The league had said that players wouldn't be paid for games they miss because they are ineligible to play.

	Marks said Irving would still be paid for road games.

	Teammates had said they were supportive of Irving's decision, but Marks seemed to indicate there was concern for the fan reaction. New York was hit hard in early March 2020 by the virus and the Nets' arena became a vaccination site this spring.

	""There are countless, countless workers who have lost jobs because of this, there are people who have lost loved ones and so forth and as I've mentioned before this is serious,"" Marks said. ""And we play a game of basketball. And although it's serious and we take our job extremely seriously, these are mandates that right now we don't have any control over. All we can do is abide by them and think that science and the people governing -- whether it's our city, whether it's our state, whether the country -- are making the right calls for us all to get back and to move on into a healthy and safer environment.""

Advocates want COVID-19 vaccine boosters for B.C. seniors in the community ,"Oct. 11, 2021 10:18 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Seniors living in long-term care are now being offered a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine, but elderly British Columbians who live in the community aren't, and advocates say that needs to change.

	“We are already hearing that some of the double shot Pfizer (recipients) are getting COVID again, and there have been deaths,” said Ramona Kaptyn, president of the Surrey/White Rock chapter of the Canadian Association of Retired Persons.

	Geriatrician Dr. Naaz Parmar is also hearing concern from her elderly patients, some of whom would likely be in long-term care, but have chosen to stay at home longer because of COVID-19.

	“They are seeing themselves at that same degree of frailty, they’re seeing themselves at a degree of exposure because they have care workers coming and going and other such things, but they are not in that first cohort,’ said Parmar.

	With Alberta now offering boosters to anyone over age 75, Parmar and CARP want British Columbia to act now.

	“It could be done just like before, starting with over-80s and then working down,” said Kaptyn. “We know how to do it. We’ve done it. I think it’s time to get on with it.”

	Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, believes seniors will get their third shot this year.

	“To me, it’s a matter of time,” Conway said. “And I think as other provinces do it, then it will probably push B.C. to do it more quickly. They will get it sooner rather than later, we just don’t know when yet.”

	And when third shots are offered to seniors, he’s hoping they can be administered in family doctors’ offices, instead of large-scale vaccine clinics.

	“If we are going to vaccinate more people more quickly, we need to put COVID vaccines in the hands of many more health-care providers,” Conway said.

	He thinks it could be done in conjunction with their flu shots, and believes there is adequate supply for third doses for British Columbians 65 and older.

	“We do have enough,” said Kaptyn. “I’m sure that we have enough. We’re giving some to other countries because we have too much now. So it is available, and it should be administered.”

Thanksgiving dinners could lead to COVID-19 spike: epidemiologist,"Oct. 11, 2021 7:06 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	Thanksgiving marks yet another pandemic holiday, and one epidemiologist is reminding Manitobans to remain careful to avoid a spike in COVID-19 cases.

	This weekend, many Manitobans are excited to see family for the first time in a while.

	""Well, we're just going to family's this afternoon, but yesterday we had dinner at another family member's, and you know it's pretty peaceful, pretty quiet this year,"" said Jody Stanton.

	Ben Henning, who is heading to his in-law’s for dinner to celebrate the holiday, said it has been a long time coming.

	""We're all vaccinated, so we are all safe,"" said Henning.

	""We are doing the responsible things. Trying to stay out of trouble and keeping the love real.

	Other Manitobans aren't quite ready to have large gatherings yet.

	""It's just a regular weekend with COVID and everything going on. It's just another year where we will be waiting,"" Randy Kendall, who is staying home this Thanksgiving.

	Staying home might not be a bad idea.

	Winnipeg-based epidemiologist Cynthia Carr said Thanksgiving last year caused a large spike in COVID-19 cases.

	""I think eight new cases per 100,000 on average right now, which is actually higher than where we were last year,"" she said. ""We don't want to see a five-fold increase like we did last year.""

	To help try and stop the spread, the province implemented new gathering limit restrictions ahead of the Thanksgiving weekend.

	Households are limited to guests from one other household for indoor private gatherings if an unvaccinated person, who is eligible to be vaccinated, is in attendance.

	Households are also limited to ten guests for outdoor private gatherings when an unvaccinated person, who is eligible to be vaccinated, is on the property.

	However, Carr said, even with the vaccine, gatherings like Thanksgiving present unique issues.

	""Family gatherings, friend gatherings often are multigenerational with older people and younger people. So again, you could have a mix of people who aren't vaccinated if they're too young or older people,” she said.

	On Friday, there were 130 new COVID-19 cases; 90 among unvaccinated individuals, seven among partially-vaccinated people, and 33 in fully vaccinated individuals.

	Carr said while the vaccine is effective in preventing severe outcomes, fully vaccinated individuals can still catch the virus.

	""It is the case like any other vaccine that even fully vaccinated can become infected with COVID-19,"" said Carr.

	Despite pandemic-related changes, Manitobans are still excited to have a Thanksgiving dinner.

	""It's the best. It's absolutely the best thing,"" said Stanton.

'There's quite a bit of scope to do this in a time of pandemic' legal expert says of vaccine mandates,"Oct. 9, 2021 9:52 a.m. CST","
     
     HALIFAX - 
     
    
	We have entered the phase of the COVID 19 pandemic in which the vaccine is being mandated and proof of vaccine being required at work, public places, restaurants and businesses.

	It has caused a lot of reactions and support for some outrage, and even some questions surrounding legality.

    Advertisement
    
	Legal and constitutional expert Wayne McKay, a professor emeritus at Dalhousie University's Schulich School of Law, says in most cases, mandating vaccines can be done and expects it would withstand any legal challenge.
        RELATED STORIES
       Mandatory vaccines are causing a flashpoint: but when does it cross the line?

	""There's quite a bit of scope to do this in a time of pandemic and crisis,"" MacKay told CTV anchor Paul Hollingsworth in an interview Friday evening.

	The key to a vaccine mandate withstanding a legal challenge depends on how reasonable it is, because rights are not absolute and government can impose reasonable limits on them and interfere with individual rights as little as possible.

	""People pretty well accept that given the crisis that is COVID-19, they have a legitimate objective to try to prevent the spread,"" MacKay said. ""So the only real question is: 'Are they doing it in a way that properly balances public health, to the general population and limiting individual rights as little as possible?' And as long as they do that, most cases where they are challenged, they're not likely to succeed.""

	While some call it overreach to mandate vaccines, MacKay says determining that depends on the facts of the situation.

	""If, for example, you worked exclusively from home and had no public contact and they tried to require you to be vaccinated, it seems to me that would be pretty hard to justify, and it's much more easy to justify it in certain sectors where there's a vulnerable population such as in hospitals or schools, for example, especially with kids under 12,"" MacKay said. ""So if they're protecting a vulnerable population, if there's a lot of public contact, then I think they probably have a pretty good chance of justifying it.""

	The other aspect of vaccines is the discussion around them – which has become pretty heated, especially on social media.

	The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees freedom of speech, but as with any right it is not absolute.

	""I've rarely seen such emotional and divisive, an issue is the vaccines, and as you say effect, particularly on social media that's played out in a pretty robust way, but free speech is not absolute,"" MacKay said. ""They've said from the beginning, you can't cry 'fire' in a crowded theatre, and I think that's really the bottom line. In exercising any individual rights, including freedom of speech, you have to do it in a way that does not interfere with the health and safety of the people around you.""

Northern hospitals 'overwhelmed' as B.C. doctors warn public to be safe,"Oct. 9, 2021 9:48 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Doctors in northern British Columbia are warning residents to be extra cautious to avoid injury, as hospitals in the area – which has the lowest vaccination rates in the province – are overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. 

	The fourth wave of the pandemic is being driven by infections in the Northern Health Authority, with dozens of patients flown to Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island hospitals to receive care. This week, the chief of staff at a northern B.C. hospital wrote an open letter warning people in the Omineca region near Prince George that their hospital’s emergency department could be shut down after staff – who were fully vaccinated – caught COVID-19. 

    Advertisement
    
	""Our hospital is overwhelmed and our staffing is compromised – I don't think that everyone in our community understands how easily the staffing of a small rural hospital can be compromised,” said Dr. Rebecca Janssen, a hospitalist and chief of staff at Vanderhoof’s St. John Hospital.

	“We are effectively begging people to be vaccinated and I hope that by expressing what dire straits we're in it does penetrate and people start taking this seriously, because I'm very worried for the community.“

	A CULTURE OF SCEPTICISM AND DISTRUST

	One of the MLAs in the region says he’s faced threats and there have been protests at his constituency office due to his vaccine advocacy, with an atmosphere of vaccine hesitancy and even hostility he blames on close proximity to Alberta.

	""Alberta has been, we've all seen, very slow to take the COVID-19 pandemic seriously and that really spread into our region,” said Peace River-South MLA Mike Bernier. “I've talked to a lot of people who say, 'If they're not doing it in Alberta, why are we doing it in British Columbia?'""

	Family physician Dr. Suzanne Campbell believes the scepticism and lackadaisical attitude toward vaccines was, in part, due to low infection rates and few first-hand experiences with the virus before the fourth wave.

	""I think it was a false belief that somehow we're protected by being in a rural community, by living on a farm, by not living in apartment buildings, by having more space that somehow we could avoid this,” she said, pointing out many people misunderstand of don’t follow guidelines when they test positive.

	“Now, we really see the explosion of cases and we really see the pattern of this person was sick and their close contact disregarded the pulbic health recommendations and they went to school or to work and a week later we get those two phone calls.”

	Earlier this week, the mayor of Pouce Coupe was stripped of some positions after questioning whether hospitals were actually full of COVID-19 patients, and a viral video of a speaker at a Dawson Creek council meeting was removed from YouTube for promoting vaccine misinformation, describing COVID-19 vaccines as a “genetic experiment.”

	COMMUNITY DAMAGE AS FEARS GROW OVER EMERGENCY CAPACITY

	Bernier warned the north is in trouble with so many COVID-19 patients, most of whom are unvaccinated, taking up scant hospital resources. 

	“I've gone and checked and we have zero beds right now and what scares me is if we have a traumatic situation, we have a car crash, a house fire, someone has a heart attack – we don't have beds in Dawson Creek,” he said. “I've confirmed with doctors that a lot of those beds are being taken up by COVID patients.""

	The warning was echoed by Campbell, who said Prince George and other communities are similarly strapped for health-care capacity.

	“Our emergency department is full,” she said, bluntly. “This is not a time to be doing high-risk activities, because if you get in a car accident, unfortunately all of the medical services we depend on might be delayed because the system is being overwhelmed.""

	Janssen pointed out that the north has the highest infection rates and lowest vaccination percentages in the province, a dynamic driven by misinformation and distrust in public institutions. That distrust is leading exhausted health-care workers to despair of their standing in the eyes of their neighbours and friends.

	""I had hoped that if local physicians would try to speak to the community, we would have buy-in because as rural physicians, we see people through some of the most intense times in their lives – we attend their births, we see them through their deaths, injuries, cancer diagnoses,” she said. “It is very troubling and very hurtful to see that trust isn't actually there and that, I have found very difficult.”

Canucks centre Jason Dickinson not afraid to speak up for what he believes,"Oct. 8, 2021 11:45 p.m. CST","
     
    
	Jason Dickinson isn't exactly sure where the feeling comes from.

	The Vancouver Canucks centre has a burning desire - a need, really - to stand up for what he believes.

    Advertisement
    
	“I don't know,” Dickinson said after a long pause when asked about that personality trait. “I just do.”

	The Georgetown, Ont., native stepped into the spotlight in August 2020 when he joined Vegas Golden Knights winger Ryan Reaves, who is Black, goalie Robin Lehner and then-Dallas Stars teammate Tyler Seguin, who like Dickinson are both white, in taking a knee during the American and Canadian national anthems inside the NHL's post-season bubble.

	They were the first NHL players in uniform to kneel in support of social justice and equality, and the first to do so during the playing of O Canada.

	“Black Lives Matter, equality, justice - you can pick the term, it doesn't really matter,” Dickinson said at the time. “Educate yourself, look into things, watch documentaries, talk to people.

	“Just learn, try to open your mind a little bit ... this is a big issue that needs to be addressed.”

	Acquired from Dallas for a third-round draft pick this summer before signing an three-year, US$7.95-million contract with the Canucks, Dickinson remains willing to voice his opinion in a sport where that's not historically been the case, including when it comes to COVID-19 vaccinations.

	“The vaccine works - it works,” Dickinson said bluntly. “There's a lot of people that want to argue it. And I guess that's their right, but there's a lot of people that are losing their rights right now by having to wait (the unvaccinated) out.”

	In the aftermath of taking that knee, however, he also experienced something new - vitriolic blowback, especially online.

	“Social media is tough,” the 26-year-old said at last month's NHL/NHLPA media tour. “People are a lot more willing to speak up because they never have to face (consequences), necessarily. You have a lot of people that will voice some pretty outrageous opinions

	“Pretty scary that some of these thoughts are out there.”

	Scott Walker, who coached Dickinson in junior with the Ontario Hockey League's Guelph Storm, said his former player's stance on social justice, and how he went about expressing it, didn't come as a surprise.

	“He didn't go out on Instagram the next day saying we should all be doing it,” said the former NHL winger. “He just does what he feels is right.

	“He doesn't push his agenda on anybody.”

	It's the same soft-spoken, driven Dickinson who helped push Guelph to the 2014 OHL title.

	“His belief system is his belief system,” Walker said in a recent phone interview. “He just does what he feels is right, and doesn't need attention.”

	And that's pretty much the approach Dickinson brings on the ice.

	“Consistency, reliability,” he said of his characteristics as a player. “Not flashy, but I'm effective.”

	The 29th pick at the 2013 NHL draft is also finely in tune with his strengths and limitations on a team that has the likes of Elias Pettersson and Bo Horvat above him in the centre pecking order.

	“I'll create offence, but not necessarily a ton,” said Dickinson, who has 25 goals and 63 points in 225 regular-season NHL games. “I'm going to be the guy that gets put out there in a big penalty kill situation or the last minute when we need to protect our net.”

	That responsibility in his team's zone is something he's had in his tool belt since minor hockey.

	“I've always worried more about the defensive end first,” Dickinson said. “My dad, my coaches always preached that to me as I was growing up. It ended up coming natural.”

	Walker described Dickinson, who he made captain of the Storm in 2014-15, as both “a quiet leader” and “a coach's dream.”

	“Low maintenance, can play all the way up and down your lineup,” said Walker, who played parts of four seasons with the Canucks in the 1990s. “Where he slots in for Vancouver (to start) will be different from where we ends up in Vancouver. They'll be able to use them in so many positions.

	“His hockey sense is elite.”

	Canucks head coach Travis Green said he's noticed an unexpected level of maturity from a player with a relatively thin NHL resume - albeit one that does include 40 post-season contests with the Stars.

	“He seems older than the games that he's played,” Green said. “He asks good questions, he wants to make sure he understands what we're doing, how we're playing, the type of system.

	“That's refreshing.”

	Growing up outside Toronto, Dickinson is ready for the roller-coaster of playing in a Canadian market.

	“When things are going well, it's good,” he said. “But you've got to accept that when things are bad, they're bad.

	“If you want them to love you (all the time), go to somewhere that doesn't understand the game.”

	Walker has little doubt Dickinson, who's dedicated his time to charities in both Guelph and Dallas, will make his mark on and off the ice in Vancouver.

	“I've got lots of respect for Jason ... he's just the greatest person,” Walker said. “Very conscientious, very caring, very thoughtful.

	“It's an unbelievable fit ... they got a good one.”

In the 24-hour period since the last COVID-19 update, five more people died from the disease, officials said. That brought the total number of local fatalities since the start of the pandemic to 2,001.

	Active cases increased slightly over the past 24 hours, going from 5,929 to 5,969. Hospitalizations, however, decreased by 13 to 360. Of those, 137 people are in intensive care, which is an increase of five from the previous day.

	Officials also said two new outbreaks were reported. One was at Cherington Place in the Fraser Health region while the other was at Haven Hill Retirement Centre in Interior Health. One outbreak, at the Royal Inland Hospital, was declared over. As of Friday's update, there were 17 active outbreaks in health-care facilities.

	The majority of new cases and hospitalizations continued to be among unvaccinated people.

Interpreting breakthrough COVID-19 cases in Manitoba,"Oct. 8, 2021 6:48 a.m. CST","
     
     Winnipeg - 
     
    
	As Manitoba continues to grapple with rising COVID-19 case numbers amid the fourth wave, vaccine task force lead Dr. Joss Reimer said Manitobans should not make too much of the uptick in breakthrough cases.

	Of the province’s 132 new cases announced Thursday, 37 were fully vaccinated.

    Advertisement
    
	Of Wednesday’s 95 new cases, 23 were fully vaccinated Manitobans and on Tuesday, 45 of the province’s 102 new cases were in fully vaccinated people.

	Reimer said there are a couple of reasons not to be alarmed at the number of breakthrough cases reported each day.

	“The first is that in Manitoba, most of us are fully vaccinated, and so the more of us who are fully vaccinated, the more of us who will be part of the breakthrough cases,” Reimer told CTV News.

	“So for example, if 100 per cent of Manitobans were fully vaccinated, then 100 per cent of our cases would be in fully vaccinated people.”

	Reimer said this larger pool of fully vaccinated Manitobans makes the numbers tricky to interpret. However, she said the biggest takeaway from the daily data is how many fully vaccinated people who contract the virus avoided hospitalization and severe outcomes.

	“Almost all of them are very mild, so we get very few people who are fully vaccinated ending up in the hospital, and almost none in the ICU,” she said.

	“There’s really only been a handful of people who after being fully vaccinated, got sick enough that they needed ICU care, and even then, it was shorter stays, they had lots of other major health concerns that made the vaccine less effective for them.”

	Saint Boniface Hospital Medical Microbiologist Doctor Philippe Lagacé-Wiens agrees breakthrough cases in the fully vaccinated are to be expected.

	“Nothing to be surprised about and it actually corresponds well to the degree of protection that we expected in the vaccinated population,” he said.

	“We know the vaccine is somewhere between 85 and 90 per cent effective. It’s simply a rule of mathematics that if you’ve got a much bigger population that is vaccinated, you eventually get close to parity between the cases in vaxxed and the cases in the unvaxxed.""

	Lagacé-Wiens said it’s reasonable to have group gatherings adhering to public health guidelines where everyone is vaccinated because the risk is very low. However, he says that might change as more cases emerge in the community during the fourth wave.

	He added the risk is more complex when adding even one unvaccinated person to a group gathering.

	“It's easy enough to say ‘only Uncle Joe is unvaccinated and that is only one person out of 20, I think it’s fine.’ Uncle Joe could very well be a problem if he's infected and then causes breakthrough infections in that group,” Lagacé-Wiens said.

	It says as vaccinations allow for looser restrictions, the COVID-19 infections among those under 12 are higher than at any other time in the pandemic and at least 20 per cent will have had the virus within two years.

	The study says children will benefit if a vaccine is approved for those aged five to 11 and that would help prevent the spread to unvaccinated adults.

       'This is no joke': N.L. woman's mom, stepfather fighting COVID-19 in intensive careN.L. recommends limiting indoor private gatherings to reduce COVID-19 spread

	Earlier this week, it appeared the provincial government was considering adding more measures to reduce outbreaks at faith gatherings. Premier Andrew Furey had a phone call with provincial religious leaders Tuesday, during which he discussed the importance of the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination passports.

	This came amid reports of growing community spread of the novel coronavirus in central Newfoundland -- a region sometimes referred to as the province's Bible Belt.

	On Wednesday, The Canadian Press reported that a couple who attended the First United Pentecostal Church in Bishop's Falls, N.L., were gravely ill as a result of the virus, while public health officials noted there were 56 active cases in central Newfoundland. The church pastor said he was fully vaccinated, adding that he hadn't told congregants whether they should or shouldn't get the vaccine.

	However, during Thursday's announcement, the province stopped short of the mandatory vaccine passport for faith gatherings. Instead, the government said it would permit faith groups to either implement the passports or cap in-person services at 50 per cent capacity, with all attending -- including ministers and musicians -- masked, bubbled and socially distanced, and with singing restricted to the choir.

	The new measures are similar to those in New Brunswick, which has also seen outbreaks linked to a Pentecostal church community. According to a spokeswoman for the Progressive Conservative government in New Brunswick, all faith venues must now require vaccination passports or limit their services to 50 per cent capacity, enforce masking and ""eliminate singing from services.""

	In Newfoundland and Labrador, there are varying levels of restriction for religious services. In the Baie Verte Peninsula, Boyd's Cove, New World Island and North-South Twillingate areas, gatherings are limited to 20 people with physical distancing. The remainder of the province allows gatherings of up to 500 people with physical distancing.

	Rev. Fred Penney, the pastor at the Elim Pentecostal Tabernacle in St. John's, said in an interview Thursday he was leaning toward the vaccine passport option, though he said he would discuss the matter with church leadership. He said it's possible that a passport policy might make people feel safer and attend church.

	He said the option of masking and social distancing would mean he has to wear a mask while giving a sermon and congregants wouldn't be able to sing -- both significant setbacks for his church if implemented.

	""I'm disappointed in this development, but I'm trying to be understanding of the government's position wanting to protect the population against a highly transmittable Delta variant,"" he said. ""As a Christian, we believe part of being a good Christian is loving our neighbour, and that includes being attentive to our neighbour's safety.""

	The pastor said he believes that churches shouldn't be lumped in with gyms, restaurants and other ""non-essential services,"" and that a universal, mandatory vaccine passport policy would have failed to recognize the special role of faith communities in society.

	""Should someone arrive at our church unannounced and in need of spiritual care and pastoral care, we would meet with them one-on-one. We wouldn't turn them away,"" he said.

	The province also announced Thursday that youth aged 12 to 18 are exempt from the passport requirement when they are participating in sports events at arenas and during indoor and outdoor practices.

	Health officials reported seven new confirmed cases of COVID-19. The province has 118 active reported cases and 16 people in hospital with the disease, including seven in intensive care.

	“Vaccines work,” Premier Jason Kenney said Thursday afternoon. “That’s why we introduced Alberta’s Restrictions Exemption Program or proof of vaccination system.”

	DO NOT TEMPT FATE THIS WEEKEND: KENNEY

	Kenney reminded Albertans the second wave of COVID-19 started after Thanksgiving last year. While he says the province has been making gains in the fight against COVID-19, with ICU admissions remaining relatively stable over the past seven days, that reality can quickly change.

	“Those gains are very tentative,” he said. “They could all be lost overnight, this weekend if Albertans do not carefully follow the public health guidelines.”

	“Particularly over the days to come, if you are not vaccinated – that is a choice that you have made – but please understand that you are at a much higher risk of both transmission, infection, and hospitalization,” Kenney added.

	

	

	The premier said that the unvaccinated should not “tempt fate” by socializing over the long weekend with people outside their household. Currently, public health restrictions prevent indoor social gatherings for those who are vaccine-eligible but are unvaccinated.

	“The health care system is still under severe stress,” he said. “I plead with Albertans not to read into some recent encouraging data a licence to ignore the public heath guidelines and restrictions that are in place.”

	As of 12:25 p.m. Thursday, Alberta Health Services (AHS) told CTV News there are 374 total ICU beds. Overall, 309 of those beds are in use, or 83 per cent of the ICU system’s capacity.

	The North zone is operating at 100 per cent of current ICU capacity levels. The South zone is at 94 per cent capacity while the Central zone is at 88 per cent capacity.

	The Edmonton and Calgary zones are at 81 and 79 per cent operating capacity, respectively.

	The Edmonton zone continues to have the most patients in ICU out of all zones since Aug. 18.

	Hinshaw added that last year before the Thanksgiving weekend, Alberta only had 92 patients in hospital seeking treatment for COVID-19 total, including 24 in intensive care.

	“Now there are 248 (in ICU),” she said.

	“We need all Albertans to have a safe Thanksgiving by having gatherings as small as possible.”

	PLEA FOR PREGNANT WOMEN TO GET VACCINATED

	During the media availability, Hinshaw urged pregnant women to get vaccinated to ensure they reduce the risk of serious outcomes should they test positive for COVID-19.

	“We have seen a continued rise in the number of pregnant Albertans admitted to ICU over the last month,” she said.

	Hinshaw reported that since July 15, a total of 14 women were admitted to ICU due to contracting COVID-19 – including eight pregnant women since Sept. 9.

	“While this may not seem like a big number to some, it is double the number of pregnant ICU admissions we saw in the entire first year of the pandemic,” she added.

	“We need everyone who is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or who has recently delivered, to receive the protection of both doses of COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. This is the best way to protect you and your baby from COVID-19.”

	As of Oct. 30, you will need more than just a mask if you want to travel in Canada.

	Wednesday, the federal government announced that passengers 12 and over who are eligible will need to be fully vaccinated when travelling by plane, train, or boat in Canada.

	The new rules also apply to all airlines and airport staff, all employees of federally regulated railways, and marine operators with Canadian vessels.

	The Winnipeg Airports Authority said it implemented a vaccine policy prior to the federal announcement, and all airport employees were already required to be fully vaccinated by the end of October.

	Vice President of Communications and Government Relations, Tyler MacAfee said it wants people who are travelling with them to be safe.

	“The trick now will be for the airlines to be able to validate that vaccination piece when you check in to get your boarding pass. So it won’t be a requirement right now to enter the airport, but to get on a plane it will be.”

	MacAfee said air travel accounts for a very small percentage of the overall cases in Canada, but these new rules are one way the industry can do more to prevent the spread of the virus.

	Train passengers and employees will also need to show proof of vaccination.

	In a statement to CTV News, a spokesperson for Via Rail Canada said in part:

	“Via Rail’s number one priority has always been the health and safety of its passengers and employees and the implementation of mandatory vaccination will contribute to ensuring that Via Rail’s trains and other facilities remain as safe as possible for everyone.”

	The federal government said it’ll be up to each industry to establish processes to verify vaccine status.

	It said there will be a short transition phase from now until November 30th where travellers have the option to show a negative COVID-19 test instead of proof of vaccination.

	On Wednesday morning, the prime minister and deputy prime minister outlined the new vaccine mandate, laying out the rules for travelers moving around the country by air or train to produce proof of vaccination, but ferry travel is exempt; this is in line with provincial exemptions from the B.C.

	“This fourth wave has made things challenging, especially for the families of children who are not yet eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, and certainly for our schools,"" said Education Minister Adriana LaGrange.

	Contact tracing will not begin until Oct. 12, after the Thanksgiving long weekend, and will be school-directed for at least a month, until Alberta Health Services has hired back enough staff to take over the work.

	Rapid testing will also be offered to students in schools with at least 10 cases of COVID-19. Parents will be able to request rapid tests from their child's school and can administer them at home. Six million rapid tests are on order, the province said. 

	The additional health measures are needed to ensure in-person learning can continue safely, said LaGrange, but critics say the province moved far too slow. 

	""Really, any measures they put in now is great, but they're really too little, too late,"" said Medeana Moussa with the group Support Our Students. 

	""The case numbers in schools were completely foreseeable and that this government took so long to act is another example of their failure in leadership and their failure to prioritize students.""

	A different approach less than a block away, where the owner of a popular cafe moved to take-out only when the passport requirement took effect.

	Customer's health records aren't his business, says Tarek Kostek, and policing the policy shouldn't be his problem.

	""And now we have to hire somebody to stand in the door, pay him two or three hundred dollars to ask for your ID?"" Kostek says. ""We can't afford that.""

	Increasingly, though, support for vax-passes appears to be growing.

	A National survey from Halifax based Narrative Research found 85 per cent want to see them mandatory for air-travel, and 78 per cent for live sports or shows.

	About three-quarters think passes should be required to get into a gym, and 67 per cent want them in restaurants.

	But all of that assumes you can easily get one.

	Visually impaired and mobility challenged, 68-year-old Wayne MacNaughton wound up asking Twitter for advice because the government recommendations simply won't work for him.

	""Well, that's great if you have a computer printer or an IPhone, but a lot of people don't,"" MacNaughton said.  ""And, certainly, a lot of the people that I know don't.""

	Buried in online responses, he wound-up getting a phone number, but says he'll wait a few days before trying to get through.

	Vaccine records still aren't required for a host of other services and activities, including retail, banking and church, but masks often are.

	The system is generally working pretty well. At least two patrons were quietly turned away at the Lions Head Tavern in Halifax on Tuesday.

	They were apologetic for not having their documents with them, but, as Duffy says, everyone seems to understand now there are consequences for not carrying those passports.

"B.C. adds 593 cases of COVID-19, no deaths as new vaccine requirement announced","Oct. 6, 2021 10:38 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	British Columbia has recorded another 593 cases of COVID-19 but no related deaths, the government said Tuesday after officials announced a new vaccine requirement for visitors in health-care settings.

	The latest numbers, provided in a written statement from the Ministry of Health, put the province's seven-day average for new infections at 694 per day, down from 702 on Monday.

	The seven-day average for coronavirus-related deaths, which hit a seven-month high of 7.29 last week, dropped to 5.86 per day.

	The number of infectious coronavirus patients in hospital increased to 345, up from 326 on Monday, with 144 of those in intensive care. The province only updates the number of people who remain hospitalized due to COVID-19 but are no longer infectious once per week.

	The unvaccinated continue to make up the majority of B.C.'s case and hospitalization numbers, according to the ministry, despite representing a relatively small and shrinking percentage of the population.

	Between Sept. 27 and Oct. 3, people who haven't received a single dose of vaccine were infected at a rate of 297.3 per 100,000 population after adjusting for age, compared to 35.1 per 100,000 population among the fully vaccinated.

	Similarly, between Sept. 20 and Oct. 3, the unvaccinated were hospitalized at a rate of 36.7 per 100,000 population after adjusting for age, compared to 1.7 per 100,000 population among the fully vaccinated.

	So far, 88.3 per cent of eligible residents age 12 and older have received at least one dose of vaccination, and 81.7 per cent have received both.

	Earlier in the day, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced that visitors in health-care settings across B.C. will soon need to provide proof of vaccination. The requirement is first being implemented in long-term care homes and assisted living facilities on Oct. 12, then expanding to all acute care and community care settings on Oct. 26.

	There are currently 19 active outbreaks in health-care facilities across the province, including one announced Tuesday at the University Hospital of Northern B.C.

	While only 18 per cent of the cases announced Tuesday acme from the Northern Health region, it has been experiencing a far higher rate of infections per capita.

	Northern Health recorded 30.6 cases per 100,000 population, compared to 14.9 in Interior Health, 12.4 in Island Health, 10.6 in Fraser Health and 5.7 in Vancouver Coastal Health.

	Getting two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine led to thousands of dollars in cash and scholarship prizes for 17 Manitobans as part of the second round of the province’s Vax to Win lottery.

	Crown Services Minister Jeff Wharton, Advanced Education, Skills and Immigration Minister Wayne Ewasko, and Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries President and CEO Manny Atwal made the announcement Tuesday morning at the vaccine supersite at the RBC Convention Centre.

	“We are extremely grateful and proud of the way Manitobans have stepped up to the plate to be vaccinated this summer to support the fight against COVID-19,” Wharton said.
	“As we are now in the fourth wave, it has become more clear how the vaccine has been a difference maker.”

	Seven adult winners were chosen including three from the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and one from each of Manitoba’s other regional health authorities.

	They each won a prize of $100,000.

	To incentivize people to get the COVID-19 vaccine, the Manitoba government introduced the Vax to Win lottery back in June.

	As part of this initiative, the province held two draws – one for eligible Manitobans who got at least one dose on or before Aug. 2, and another for all eligible residents who received both doses on or before Sept. 6. Manitobans were automatically entered when they received their vaccine.

	Both of these lottery draws offer three $100,000 prizes in the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, a $100,000 prize in each of the remaining health authorities, and 10 scholarships for $25,000 for Manitobans aged 12 to 17.

	Manitoba revealed the winners of the first lottery in August.

	As of Monday afternoon, 85.2 per cent of eligible Manitobans have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 81.1 per cent have received both doses.

	Once again, the numbers show the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated continue to make up the vast majority of cases and hospitalizations in the province, according to the ministry.

	Just under 65 per cent of infections recorded from Sept. 24 to 30 involved people who hadn't received a single dose of vaccine, a group that represents about 20 per cent of the province.

	The unvaccinated caught COVID-19 at a rate of 295.7 per 100,000 population during that period after adjusting for age, the ministry said, compared to 35.8 per 100,000 among the fully vaccinated.

	Monday marked the first day that students from kindergarten to Grade 3 were required to wear masks at school, including at their desks. Previously, the requirement only applied to students in Grades 4 through 12.

	Parents and teachers are hopeful the masks will help curb the province's recent spike in COVID-19 infections involving school-aged children who are not yet eligible for vaccination.

	Of the eligible population age 12 and older, 88.2 per cent have now received at least one dose of vaccine, and 81.6 per cent have received both.

	The province also began giving out booster shots to vulnerable residents of long-term care homes and assisted living facilities on Monday, a move that's hoped to slow the resurgence of outbreaks in those settings. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has noted that elderly populations can develop a less robust immune response after getting the shots, and residents in care were among the first to receive the vaccine during B.C.'s rollout.

	Officials also noted another 241 cases were identified over the weekend, 121 on Saturday and 120 on Sunday.

	The numbers over the last three days include 122 cases from Southern Health, 87 from Winnipeg, 48 from Northern Health, 42 from Prairie Mountain Health and 25 from the Interlake-Eastern Health Region.

	Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, said with the way cases are trending right now, Manitoba is heading down a severe trajectory.

	""Right now we are tracking on the severe scenario. So we are seeing case numbers go up, we are seeing significant increases in hospitalizations and ICU,"" said Roussin, adding that some health regions are adding to the COVID-19 strain more than others.

	The five-day test positivity rate is 3.7 per cent in Manitoba and 1.5 per cent in Winnipeg, with Roussin saying outbreaks throughout the province are leading to the inflated test positivity rate.

	""Certainly, transmission and test positivity in Southern Health is contributing a significant degree to that,” he said.

	“In other areas such as Northern, we have some localized outbreaks, which are contributing to significant test positivity as well, as well as in other regions.""

	He added that the Southern Health Region does have the highest test positivity rate in the province, but wouldn't specify what that number is.

	Roussin is encouraging Manitobans to continue to practice the fundamentals and follow the new health orders that will be coming into effect on Tuesday in order to help lower the overall case count in the province.

	While Roussin is calling on people to do the right thing with the new health orders, one southern Manitoba doctor isn't sure what impact it will have on residents.

	Dr. Don Klassen, a family physician and anesthesiologist in Winkler, thinks those who are unvaccinated will just avoid places that require vaccination requirements.

	He also doesn't think private gatherings will shrink with the new orders.

	""It does sound a little pessimistic, but I think that's the reality we have at the moment,"" said Klassen.

	Klassen adds, what does make him optimistic is that more than 81 per cent of eligible Manitobans have received both doses of the vaccine. 

	There are currently 814 active cases, and Manitoba has had 60,943 cases since March 2020.

	The province is also reporting two new deaths. Both of these deaths were men in their 70s from the Southern Health Region and both were linked to an unspecified variant of concern. One death happened on Saturday and one on Sunday.

	The province has recorded 1,213 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.

	Manitoba has 98 people in hospital due to COVID, 64 of which have active cases. There are 18 COVID-19 patients in the ICU, including 13 with active cases.

	On Sunday, 2,403 tests were completed, bringing the total to 1,014,482 since February 2020.

	Abigail Nicole, manager of Sidekick café in Halifax's north end, said she has been reading as much as she can on province's guidelines to prepare herself and staff.

	""I know it's tough for some people but there's only so much we can do. We're not police officers, we're not the government,"" Nicole said, noting her business opened during the pandemic and is already coping with staffing shortages.

	""There is not fear but I think there is a level of uncertainty in terms of what we're going to have to deal with,"" Nicole said.

	Nicole and her staff will be required to ask customers for proof of vaccine, and cross-reference their immunization card with a piece of ID.

	""Just make sure they are who they say they are and we can kind of get it over as quickly as possible,"" Nicole said.

	In Nova Scotia, public health is encouraging people to print a new immunization card that includes a QR code -- a new federal standard that became available for Nova Scotians on Friday.

	While CTV News tried in the morning and early afternoon to access the new passport and was unable to, by late afternoon, it was available after plugging in health card information and an email address at Novascotia.ca/proof.

	""It's the federal standard card and as of Oct. 22, Nova Scotia will implement VaxCheckNS, a QR code scanner app that businesses and organizations can use on a smartphone or other device to scan a paper or digital version of person's proof of vaccination,"" said Kristen Lipscombe, media relations advisor with Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness.

	Vaccine passports have been rolled out across Canada, including in New Brunswick.

	At the Old Triangle in Moncton, manager Todd VanIderstine said it wasn't a smooth start.

	""Just with people not being aware, those who disagree with it or just people forgetting,"" he said.

	While provinces are beginning to adopt a federal standard of a COVID-19 passport, that will eventually be used for international travel, it's currently a patchwork of COVID passes across the country—making some passes tough to recognize and the rules tough to enforce.

	""It scaled from something that looked like a word document to the QR system in Quebec to stickers to handwritten notes,"" VanIderstine said.

	Bruce Macfarlane, communications director with the Department of Health in New Brunswick, said the province isworking toward adopting the federal standard format that includes a verifiable vaccination credential in the form of a QR code in MyHealthNB. 

	""This credential can be used for international travel, with the potential for domestic use also,"" he said.

     REGINA - 
     
    
	Saskatchewan is asking the federal government to make efforts to acquire the COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatments or the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

	According to some studies, the recently approved antibody treatment could help slow the spread of COVID-19 infection inside the body if administered within 10 days of first being infected.

	Premier Scott Moe said Thursday he also plans to ask for more specialists to help health care workers in the fight against COVID-19’s fourth wave in addition to the treatments.

	“Are there other early intervention treatments that may be an opportunity for us to actually reduce the people that are going into our hospitals, just to identify people that may be at high risk of severe outcomes of COVID and offer those treatments to those individuals so that ultimately does reduce the pressure that we're feeling in our hospital systems,” Moe said.

	At a press conference Friday, federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Ottawa is willing to work with Saskatchewan, but it needs more details on how the treatment would be used.

	“We do have a supply in Canada. We also know that Saskatchewan has a supply and again, once we understand the degree to which they propose to use these antibodies and the timeline, we will have a better sense of how we can meet the need,” said Hajdu.

	The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health said a monoclonal antibody seeing regular use in Saskatchewan through the pandemic is tocilizumab, a drug administered in hospitals to patients with severe symptoms.

	SASK. JOINS CALLS FOR JOHNSON & JOHNSON DOSES

	Even with antibody treatments helping some patients, health care professionals say vaccinations are still the best way to protect against the virus, leading Saskatchewan to join with Alberta in requesting supplies of the single-dose Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine from the federal government.

	”Alberta and Saskatchewan are committed to working together to secure a supply of Janssen vaccine. The intent is provide it to primary health care sites or those locations where the single dose vaccine option would lead to an increased COVID-19 vaccination uptake,” the Ministry said in a statement.

	The federal government said the Janssen vaccine still needs to meet all required criteria for vaccine authorization.

	“There have been some studies that have come out to show that there's added benefit from a second dose of the [Janssen] vaccine to help boost immunity,” said Dr. Supriya Sharma, Health Canada’s chief medical advisor.

	Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam noted residents should be assured all available vaccines in Canada are safe, but if the Janssen vaccine is the only vaccine people will take, they’ll acquire some doses.

	“I think one thing that we need from the provinces, is a good estimation of the amount that is required. We do not want to waste any vaccines that can help other countries in the world,” Dr. Tam said.

	The federal government currently does not have any Johnson & Johnson vaccines on hand.

Plummeting HPV vaccination rate in Alberta a concern for health experts,"Oct. 2, 2021 6:26 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Members of two Canadian health organizations are raising the alarm about a drastic drop in the number of eligible youth who were vaccinated against HPV last year thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.

	Both the Federation of Medical Women of Canada (FMWC) and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) are calling on provincial and territorial public health services to prioritize HPV prevention.

    Advertisement
    
	The warning comes ahead of Canada's fifth annual HPV prevention week, which starts on Sunday, Oct. 3.

       Catch-up clinic for routine immunizations provided in schools to be hosted by AHSOpinion: How COVID-19 is creating lost cohorts for HPV vaccination in youth and why that matters

	Both groups said the pandemic disrupted HPV vaccination programs at schools throughout Alberta, causing clinics to be postponed, interrupted and cancelled.

	According to data obtained on the Government of Alberta's childhood immunization coverage dashboard, just 9.8 per cent of eligible 12-year-old girls received their second HPV vaccine dose in 2020, compare to 65.5 per cent in 2019. (Edmonton 8.7 per cent in 2020, Calgary 12 per cent in 2020.)

	For eligible 12-year-old boys, just 7.9 per cent received their second shot in 2020, compared to 62.9 per cent in 2019. (Edmonton, 6.8 per cent in 2020; Calgary 9.5 per cent in 2020.)

	Dr. Vivien Brown, past president of the Federation of Medical Women of Canada (FMWC) and chair and co-founder of HPV Prevention Week in Canada, said the numbers are concerning.

	""About 75 to 80 per cent of adults will have been exposed to HPV at some point in their life,"" Brown said. ""When you're exposed to HPV some of us clear it, the way we clear any other virus, but some of us end up with persistent HPV.

	""We know that persistent HPV can lead to six different types of cancers in men and women; the most common is cervical cancer, but we're also seeing anal cancer, penile cancer, vulvar or vagina cancer and head and neck cancers – or throat cancers.

	""For the last 10 years we've had a vaccine that is very effective against the HPV virus, so if we end up vaccinating – particularly young people, before they get exposed to HPV – we'll end up being able to eliminate some of these diseases.""

	HPV vaccines are supported by public health and provided at no cost. Youth in schools across the country are able to get the shot once they turn 12.

	Though there currently two HPV vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil, the one administered at schools throughout Canada is Gardasil.

	""Public health was completely overwhelmed with COVID-19. I think that is understandable. But because they were overwhelmed both in the amount of work and in the situation, the school programs were often stopped – and that's because school was stopped,” Brown said

	""They weren't being vaccinated in the school program suddenly.""

	Brown said there's been a huge number of eligible youth that have fallen through the cracks and have not been vaccinated yet.

	""There were some catch-up clinics that were planned in August and September in Alberta, but parents had to know to take their kids to the clinic,"" she said.

	Brown is suggesting parents of Albertans age 12 and over reach out to Alberta Health Services to find out how to get their child vaccinated.

	""If you're 14 and under you only require two shots – one and one six months later. If you're 15 and older it's three shots. So there's a greater cost to the province but there's also a greater cost to the individual of having to take an extra shot because our immune systems are not as robust as we get older,"" she said.

	The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) announced on Sept. 28 that COVID-19 vaccines may be given at the same time as, or any time before or after, other vaccines, including HPV vaccine. 

	""So if you're taking your kid for anything – a flu shot, a COVID-19 shot, measles, mumps and rubella, tetanus – they can get their HPV shot at the same time,"" Brown said.

	Brown said though many students in Alberta are back to in-classroom learning this year, there is still concern that those who opted to attend class virtually might miss their chance to get vaccinated.

	There are also concerns that the program could again be disrupted should students be moved completely to online learning as COVID-19 case numbers in Alberta continue to climb.

	Brown said though there were some parents who had concerns about the HPV shot when it was introduced a decade ago, they've proved unfounded. 

	""There was some concern when the vaccine first launched that if kids get immunized, are they going to feel that they can be more promiscuous because they feel safer? The research over the past 10 years shows the reverse. As we educate kids about HPV and about exposure they actually are less likely to be sexually active.""

	Alberta Health Services hasn't yet released HPV vaccination numbers for 2021.

	The Calgary Catholic School District said delivery of HPV vaccinations was shifted last year due to COVID-19 but they will be resuming in-school immunizations this year. 

	The Calgary Board of Education declined to comment by the time of publishing.

	The Manitoba government introduced new public health orders set to take effect next week, which will create new restrictions on gatherings for those who are unvaccinated.

	On Friday, the province announced it is moving back to the orange (restricted) level on the pandemic response system, after shifting to level yellow (caution) in August. This move will not affect schools at this time, and schools will remain at level yellow to make sure kids can remain in school as much as possible.

	""These new public health orders will allow fully vaccinated Manitobans to continue to enjoy as much freedom and as few restrictions as possible,"" said Manitoba's Health Minister Audrey Gordon.

	""Unvaccinated individuals will now be more restricted in their activities.""

	These new restrictions include:

	
		Limiting households to guests from one other household for private indoor gatherings when an unvaccinated person, who is eligible to be vaccinated, is on the property. This rule applies even if the unvaccinated person lives at this location;
	
		Limiting households to 10 guests outdoors when an unvaccinated person, who is eligible to be vaccinated, is on the property. This rule applies even if the unvaccinated person lives at this location;
	
		Limiting indoor public gatherings group sizes to 25 people or 25 per cent capacity, whichever is lower, for any gatherings that include unvaccinated people, who are eligible to be vaccinated. This applies to weddings and funerals;
	
		Reducing indoor group sizes for faith-based gatherings to 25 people or 33 per cent capacity, whichever is greater, for any gatherings that include unvaccinated people, who are eligible to be vaccinated;
	
		Limiting retail capacity to 50 per cent in the Southern Health Region; and
	
		Reducing outdoor public gatherings to 50 people. This rule applies to all gatherings. However, certain organized events for fully vaccinated people can get approval.


	Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, said fully immunized residents and those under the age of 12 will be largely unaffected by the orders. He said they will be able to hold private (household), faith-based and indoor gatherings, as well as weddings, funerals and indoor recreation, without gathering limits.

	NEW HEALTH ORDERS 'A CONSEQUENCE' OF DELTA'S RISK TO HEALTH CARE

	Roussin said case numbers, hospital and ICU admissions have been increasing – mostly among unvaccinated Manitobans.

	""Our health-care system remains at risk from the Delta variant, and these COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalizations are rising,"" Roussin said.

	""Today's announcements are a consequence of that reality.""

	Roussin said two thirds of all COVID-19 admissions to the ICU in the past week were first diagnosed with COVID-19 when they arrived at hospital.

	He said in the Southern Health region, COVID-19 cases could double in less than three weeks if nothing changes, meaning the region could see 93 cases per day.

	""That alone could place the province's hospital system at risk,"" Roussin said.

	Dr. Perry Gray, the chief medical officer for Shared Health, said half of all COVID-19 patients in the ICU are from the Southern Health region.

	""The vaccine has been an incredible addition to the health-care system. In fact, I consider it in the category of an incredible gift to all of us. And it is working,"" Gray said, adding the vaccine is surpassing his expectations.

	He said the province is not seeing large numbers of fully vaccinated patients in hospital and ICU. As of Friday, there were 14 people with active cases in ICU – 12 had not been vaccinated and two had been partially vaccinated.

	""Based on what I am seeing to date, if every eligible Manitoban was fully vaccinated, the impact on our health-care system would be no worse than a mild to moderate flu season,"" Gray said.

	Roussin urged those who have not been immunized to book an appointment.

	""If some of you are waiting until the proof of vaccine requirement is going to end, please consider the consequences of waiting,"" he said. ""COVID is not going away. It is going to be with us for years, and you are much more likely to get sick from COVID – especially severe illness – if you are not vaccinated.""

	“We have been on the frontlines since the very beginning of the pandemic and now are being told we are unsafe and unfit to continue working unless we are vaccinated.”

	Adopted in early September, Windsor Regional’s vaccine policy states that all staff, volunteers and students must have received at least one shot of COVID-19 vaccine, unless they have a valid medical exemption, by Sept. 22.

	Those who remained unvaccinated were placed on unpaid leave for two weeks.

	Failure to receive a vaccine by Oct. 7 could cost them their jobs.

	Protestors believe dismissing staff who are willing to work is not the answer.

	But Windsor Regional Hospital officials are standing by the policy. In a statement to CTV News hospital officials say:

	“Patients and their loved ones expect us to do everything we can to prevent the spread and/or outbreak of COVID-19 within our hospitals, to protect our community, patients and fellow staff and to lead by example.”

	The hospital says this position is overwhelmingly supported by the community.

	Between Sept. 21 and Sept. 27, people who are not vaccinated made up 64.9 per cent of confirmed COVID-19 cases, while partially vaccinated people made up seven per cent. The remaining cases, 28 per cent, were confirmed in people who are fully vaccinated.

	Meanwhile, most people who required hospitalization due to COVID-19 in recent weeks were not vaccinated, according to the Health Ministry.

	Between Sept. 14 and Sept. 27, unvaccinated people accounted for 72.6 per cent of hospitalizations, partially vaccinated people made up 8. 2 per cent and fully vaccinated people made up 19.2 per cent.

Sask. COVID-19 'onslaught' forces some hospitals to close ERs,"Sept. 30, 2021 9:13 a.m. CST","
     
     SASKATOON - 
     
    
	Hospitalizations and admissions to ICU due to COVID-19 have nearly tripled over the last month, according to the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA).

	More than 300 people are in hospital with the disease – a record high – including more than 60 COVID-19 ICU patients.

	“As COVID cases continue to increase, teams are working hard to move staff to where we anticipate the surge to be in the coming days and weeks. This means some communities are going to see disruptions to their hospital services, including temporary emergency department closures,” Derek Miller, the SHA Emergency Operations Centre commander, said in a news release.

	“We have already seen facilities experience these disruptions, and we appreciate all those involved for supporting our provincial response to deal with this onslaught.”

	Adult admissions into the pediatric intensive care will continue, as that department continues to provide care for COVID critical care patients under the age of 11.

	Unvaccinated people are six times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than a fully vaccinated person and five times more likely to be hospitalized, the SHA says.

	Those who are vaccinated in the ICU are typically older people with other pre-existing health complications. Unvaccinated patients in ICU appear to only have their vaccination status as the common denominator, the SHA says.

	The SHA says it is doubling its vaccine clinic capacity over the month of October to support a blend of bookable, outreach, and walk in vaccine clinics.

	“I cannot stress how critical it is that if you are eligible to get vaccinated, you must do so to protect young children in your household,” Dr. Johnmark Opondo, SHA’s Medical Health Officer and Offensive Chief for Public Health, said in the release.

	“We are seeing more children getting sick with COVID in households where adults and other caregivers remain unvaccinated, and they are getting COVID at home. In the last few weeks, one in five cases in children in Saskatchewan reported were under the age of 12. We must take responsibility and create a needed circle of protection for our children who do not yet have access to a vaccine.”

	The SHA says it has now opened 30 additional ICU surge beds across the province, up from last week’s 24, with plans to surge up to care for 125 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients while maintaining care up to 50 for non-COVID-19 ICU patients.

	It is also preparing to care for up to 350 COVID non-ICU patients through Saskatchewan hospitals.

	In the release, the SHA noted several ways health care is being affected:

	
		Service slowdowns including elective surgeries as surgical staff care for growing COVID hospital and ICU cases
	
		A 32 per cent increase in overall wait times affecting 33,078 people since March 22, 2020 until September 26, 2021.
	
		Patient transfers are expected to increase in the coming days to level load care across Saskatchewan hospitals. Patients whose care needs can be met in lower acuity hospitals will be transferred – but not necessarily to the hospital closest to home or at their preferred location.
	
		Acute care facilities and long-term care homes are experiencing increased restrictions based on current local COVID-19 risk of transmission.

"Nova Scotia to take 'cautious approach' in final phase of reopening; mandates vaccines for health-care workers, teachers","Sept. 30, 2021 10:40 p.m. CST","
     
     HALIFAX - 
     
    
	Nova Scotia says it will move into the final phase of its reopening plan on Oct. 4 as planned but will proceed using a ""cautious approach.""

	The province says while most restrictions will be lifted, some will be maintained.

    Advertisement
    
	Additionally, border restrictions will be implemented for people coming from Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.

       Halifax housing crisis: Municipality to set up emergency sites to address homelessness in the cityNova Scotia reports 41 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday; active count rises to 224

	Aspects of Phase 5 include:

	
		masks will continue to be mandatory in indoor public places
	
		physical distancing and gathering limits for events hosted by a recognized business or organization will be lifted
	
		the informal gathering limits of 25 people indoors and 50 outdoors will remain in place
	
		proof of full vaccination will be required for non-essential events and activities


	""The Delta variant has impacted our epidemiology. The fourth wave is taking its toll across the country and it’s now in Nova Scotia,"" Premier Tim Houston said.

	""We can lift some restrictions with the added protection of the proof of full vaccine protocol and our high vaccination rates, but masking and limits for informal gatherings need to stay in place. We’re taking a cautious approach so we can keep moving forward, even in the midst of the fourth wave.""

	Starting at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 4, proof of full vaccination will be required for people who are 12 and older to participate in non-essential events and activities such as going to restaurants, movies, sports events, theatre performances, social events and the gym.

	Based on conversations with people in many sectors, some changes have been made to the list of places where proof of full vaccination will be required.

	For example, proof of vaccination will not be required for general library access but will be required to participate in library programs that bring groups of people together.

	It will be required for designated caregivers and visitors of residents in long-term care facilities, with limited exceptions. It will apply to dining in at fast-food establishments, but not to takeout, delivery, drive-thru or food courts.

	Proof of vaccination will not be required under the provincewide protocol for employees of businesses and organizations that offer these events and activities, but it will be required for their volunteers.

	MANDATORY VACCINES FOR HEALTH-CARE WORKERS 

	Nova Scotia will begin mandating vaccinations for health-care and long-term care workers, as well as paramedics and teachers.

	Workers have until Nov. 30 to provide proof of full vaccinations. Those not fully vaccinated, meaning zero or one dose, must participate in an education plan.

	If an employee isn't fully vaccinated by Nov. 30, they will be placed on unpaid administrative leave.

	""Despite having a highly vaccinated population, the pandemic is still having deadly consequences in the fourth wave,"" Houston said.

	""There have been three deaths in the last week alone and we need to do whatever we can to make sure other families don't have to grieve their loved ones. Too many Nova Scotians have chosen not to get vaccinated, and some of them work with Nova Scotians most at risk from COVID-19. It is time to get tough.""

	The new vaccine mandate applies to:

	
		Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre
	
		workers in long-term care facilities (licensed and unlicensed) and home-care agencies (publicly and privately funded)
	
		public school teachers, pre-primary and other school-based staff, regional and board office staff, and those providing services in schools, including cafeteria and school bus services
	
		Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia
	
		workers in residential facilities and day programs funded by the Department of Community Services Disability Support Program and adult day programs funded by Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care
	
		workers in Department of Community Services facilities and those providing placements for children and youth in the care of the Minister of Community Services (excluding foster family placements)
	
		paramedics, LifeFlight nurses and some other staff at EHS
	
		physicians and other service providers to the above organizations; for example hairdressers and contractors


	""Our vaccination rate is not increasing as fast as we need, and we are seeing the impact of the fourth wave on those who are vaccinated and unvaccinated. There are thousands of appointments available for vaccination right now,"" Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health, said in a release.

	NEW BORDER RESTRICTIONS

	Beginning 8 a.m. on Oct. 4, everyone coming to Nova Scotia from other Canadian provinces and territories, including Newfoundland and Labrador and P.E.I., will need to complete the Nova Scotia Safe Check-in form.

	Their isolation will be based on vaccination status and testing. People who were fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arriving do not have to isolate, but testing is recommended. People who are not fully vaccinated must isolate for at least seven days and get two negative test results in Nova Scotia to stop isolating after seven days. They must be lab-based tests, not rapid tests.

	TAKE-HOME TESTS FOR CHILDREN

	Families of children in pre-primary to Grade 6 in Nova Scotia’s public school system will begin to receive free COVID-19 rapid testing kits in an effort to protect unvaccinated children and their families.

	The pilot program will see Nova Scotia provide 320,000 rapid tests to families and support early detection of COVID-19.

	""We’ve heard from parents that they are concerned about their younger children who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated,"" Becky Druhan, minister of education and early childhood development, said in a release.

	""These take-home tests are one way to provide families easier access to testing for children with symptoms and an added layer of protection on top of the core public health measures that exist in our schools.""

	In the next few weeks, schools will distribute the nose swab testing kits to families who want them. Each package will contain four take-home rapid COVID-19 tests with a set of instructions on how to complete the test.

Emergency room doctor frustrated by uptick in COVID cases in southern Manitoba,"Sept. 29, 2021 9:57 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	An emergency room doctor in southern Manitoba is growing frustrated as COVID-19 cases continue to climb, saying younger patients are ending up in the hospital, and people aren’t getting tested before coming in.

	The region makes up around 15 per cent of the province's population but accounts for half of all COVID cases, with another 17 added on Tuesday.

    Advertisement
    
	With the uptick in cases, Bethesda Regional Health Centre in Steinbach is admitting several patients a day to the ICU.

	""You know, a lot of patients are in their 20s and 30s and saying, 'Oh, I was confused by what I was seeing on social media, so I just didn't get my vaccine’,"" said Dr. Jen Anderson, who is a family physician in the area and also works at Bethesda Regional Health Centre.

	Anderson noted many people are showing up to hospital with serious symptoms, yet they haven't been tested.

	She said the reasons she’s heard from patients for not getting tested vary from not wanting to wait in line, not wanting to test positive so they can work, and people who deny they have COVID.

	""Even a year and a half into this, that reassurance that this could be COVID, and you probably should be tested – even if it is just to make sure that if you are doing okay, that you aren't passing it to someone else.""

	On Monday, Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, said restrictions for the area are possible.

	""So we're certainly not ruling out a regional approach. There are certainly challenges with a regional only approach, as we know there's a lot of mobility,"" said Roussin on Monday afternoon.

	Business owners who could impacted by regional restrictions are concerned about what will happen if they come into effect.

	""Mentally, it's pretty tough,” said Jeff Eidse, who is the owner of Sweaty Training and Conditioning. “We try to make a plan, we try to do what we can in between there, but uncertainty all the time,""

	Anderson said the best way to ensure the fourth wave doesn't last long is for all people to get vaccinated.

	""Ninety-nine per cent of patients coming into the ER are unvaccinated, so that tells us that vaccination is really helping this year,"" said Anderson.

	The Southern Health Region has a vaccination rate of 65.6 per cent, while 80.3 per cent of eligible Manitobans have received both doses of the vaccine.

	Protestors against vaccine mandates for school-aged children disrupted a Thames Valley District School Board (TVDSB) meeting Tuesday evening.

	The meeting was being held at Louise Arbour French Immersion Public School on Bellfield Street in London, Ont. when dozens of protestors showed up, resulting in police having to attend.

	On the agenda was a motion to write a letter to Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health requesting that the COVID-19 vaccine be added to the list of compulsory vaccinations for students.

	When CTV News London cameras arrived on scene protestors turned their attention on journalists with chants of “tell the truth.”

	In video captured by a CTV News London reporter, protesters can be seen shouting insults and yelling obscenities towards journalists.

	

	

	At one point, the meeting had to be adjourned while police worked to control the protestors.

	“Our role as the police is to be here to maintain the peace, allow the protestors to peacefully protest, while still allowing any meetings that are going on inside the school,” said Const. Buckle.

	Ultimately, the motion was withdrawn during the meeting due to a conclusion that the letter may not be necessary.

	“It is my understanding that the Chief Medical Officer of Health is currently reviewing this issue, and the Ontario Public School Board Association will advocate on behalf of all boards. Thus, I withdrew the motion,” said Trustee Corrine Rahman in a release.

	In a statement released to media the board noted that they have been dealing with anti-vaccine supporters spreading false information online that TVDSB was attempting to mandate vaccinations for students.

	“This is false information,” said Mark Fisher, Director or Education. “The Board has no authority to mandate student COVID-19 vaccinations and was never part of the agenda.”

	Fisher had described Tuesday’s protest as “disturbing.”

	Calls to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of compulsory vaccines for students have been growing in recent weeks. Toronto’s Board of Health has indicated that it will ask the province to add COVID-19 vaccines to the list.

	Health Minister Christine Elliott has not said if that is a step the government will take but has addressed the issue stating that the province will look at anything that could protect people.

	“It's a little bit frustrating that we haven't been given any information. We don't know anything, because the government and the SHA and e-health is not actually giving anything to us as a business to say, ‘this is what you need’ or ‘this is what to expect on Oct. 1.’”

	“We haven't been given any information, so we don't know how to redeem the QR Codes. We just know that people are going to show up and have QR Codes.”

	“I think we just got kind of thrown into it without that much information, where the information we gathered we had to seek for it right so we had to search for a we had to do the homework,” he said.

	“Before where the whole pandemic first started, we were getting notifications from the government or SLGA letting us know how we're going to deal with it or how it's going to be dealt with.”

	Dojo Ramen general manager Jiwan Choi says she’ll be at the entrance doing the QR Code scanning on Friday.

	“I feel like every restaurant has to make their own rules and processes about how they're going to implement this system,” she said.

	The Ministry of Health says businesses can choose their own methods of proof of vaccine, not just a QR code.

	They include:

	
		Wallet cards received at time of immunization
	
		A printed copy of your MySaskHealthRecord (MSHR) vaccine certificate (with or without a QR code)
	
		A screenshot of your MSHR vaccine certificate (with or without a QR code) saved to your device

		A COVID-19 vaccine printout from Saskatchewan Health Authority Public Health

Carstairs asks province for guidance on Restrictions Exemption Program at its arena,"Sept. 29, 2021 8:27 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	The town of Carstairs has decided not to implement Alberta's Restriction Exemption Program (REP) at its arena. 

	A council meeting on Monday evening saw councillors defer the option to the province, asking if they could instead use the program for some user groups but not for others. 

    Advertisement
    
	“When you go through the government mandates, we have to follow the guidelines” Mayor Lance Colby said. 

	“So we tried to do what was best, what we saw for the overall good of our community.”

	Because they decided not to implement the REP at the arena, youth sports groups under the age of 18 will not need to prove they have been vaccinated.

	Parents who want to watch their kids play are also not required to show proof of vaccination when entering the facility. 

	Instead, health measures are in place at the arena – including mandatory masking and physical distancing – and they are operating at one-third fire capacity. 

	Under Alberta Health's guidelines, adult sport user groups are unable to use the facility unless town decides to implement the REP.

	It's something that does not sit well with Carstairs Bruinettes player Marla Kimball. 

	“There’s a lot of pressure from both sides, and in this case, the minor hockey (side) – or the kid's side – won,” Kimball said.

	“I think the responsible decision is to go and get vaccinated, and I think that government is pushing for people to allow the vaccinated people to flow freely, whereas, restrict the unvaccinated people a little bit and put a little bit of pressure on them.”

	Kimball said her team has not played in two years, and though everyone on it is fully vaccinated they can't play unless the decision is made by the town to implement the REP.

	“I think the right decision is to put in place a REP at the arena and allow vaccinated people to use the arena and unvaccinated people to not,” she said. 

	Kimball says she’s concerned by low vaccine uptake in rural Alberta, but suggests it’s difficult to change people’s minds, once they are made up. 

	“I have nurses in my family, I understand the pressure the hospitals are under,” she said. 

	According to provincial statistics, 60.4 per cent of people in the Didsbury and Carstairs area who are eligible for a COVID-19 shot have had a single dose, while 52.9 percent of those who are eligible are fully vaccinated. 

	There are currently 108 active cases in the Didsbury, Carstairs and South Mountainview County region, according to the province.

	Carstairs Minor Hockey president Richard Herbert said he would like to see an exemption for the community to the REP as it would allow more people to use the arena facility. 

	Herbert admits that vaccines and COVID-19 have been very divisive topics for people in the community. and said having an exception for the REP at the arena would mean volunteers wouldn't be exposed to any abuse.  

	“It’s a big advantage, because we don’t have to ask a volunteer-based organization to police who's in that building, and if they are there for our event or another event,” he said. 

	Currently rural Alberta is seeing higher case counts per 100,000 people, compared to the large city centres. 

	About 25 per cent of Alberta’s current active cases are in the Central, South and North zones. 

	CTV News reached out to Alberta Health on whether they would grant the community an exception, but have not received a response. 

	The City of Lacombe has also decided not to move forward with a facility-wide REP at its arena, the Gary Moe Auto Group Sportsplex.

	To help mitigate that risk, residents will be offered a third COVID-19 vaccine dose, about six months after their second dose. For many residents, that means they will be offered a booster shot as early as next week. The doses will be offered alongside seasonal flu shots.

	Close contacts no longer need to quarantine and AHS Public Health is no longer notifying close contacts. Household contacts of positive cases are strongly recommended to stay home for two weeks if they are not fully vaccinated.

	A parent in Edmonton wrote an open letter to the province as her son became one of 69 out of 350 students at their school to test positive for the virus.

	

	

	Alison Turner is calling for the province to resume notifying close contacts to slow the spread.

	The Canadian Paediatric Society also sent an open letter calling for mandatory reporting and contact tracing in schools, vaccine mandates for all adults working in schools and childcare settings, and masking for everyone age two and up.

	Children are particularly vulnerable as Health Canada has not yet approved vaccines for children 11 and younger.

	However, Pfizer has recently submitted data for an initial trial for its vaccine for kids 11 and under to the FDA in the U.S., with plans for a formal request for emergency use in the coming weeks. 

	While there is no timeline for when a similar request will go to Health Canada, officials in Toronto have said plans are underway to roll out the vaccine when it does get the green light here. 

	Toronto Public Health announced Monday that it formed a COVID-19 vaccination planning group to get ready for an eventual rollout of COVID-19 vaccines for children in Canada.

	Since the onset of the pandemic, Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw has maintained that Alberta's schools are not a significant driver of spread and children are less likely to suffer severe outcomes. 

	On Tuesday, the ATA released a statement calling on Alberta's UCP government to introduce a mandate requiring all teachers and staffs in schools being vaccinated against COVID-19. 

	The Alberta NDP said it supports the ATA's announcement on mandatory vaccines to slow the spread of COVID-19 among unvaccinated children. 

	“It’s outrageous that the UCP is hiding information about COVID cases in schools from students, staff and families,"" Sarah Hoffman, NDP critic for Education, said. 

	""Everyone should have the right to make informed decisions about their own safety, but the UCP refuses to release the information that would allow Albertans to do that.""

	The province says 333 in-school COVID-19 clinics have been cancelled in Alberta including 88 in the Calgary zone.

	Alberta Health Services says the majority of cancellations was a lack of consent from parents but says it has been able to accommodate schools with less than 20 consents in an effort to reduce barriers to immunization and make it as accessible as possible for the school population.

	Anyone requiring a test for travel-related purposes is encouraged to review the COVID-19 testing requirements in other jurisdictions and plan accordingly, which could include seeking testing through private service providers.

Federal government prepared to help Saskatchewan battle COVID-19 fourth wave,"Sept. 28, 2021 8:31 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	The federal government is prepared to help Saskatchewan battle its fourth wave of COVID-19.

	In a tweet on Friday, the federal health minister Patty Hajdu confirmed she spoke with provincial health minister Paul Merriman and “ensured he knows the federal government will be there to help the people of Saskatchewan in this health crisis.”

    Advertisement
    
	“We stand ready to help wherever we are needed,” the tweet read.

       Sask. reports most active COVID-19 cases to date with 4,864Sask. NDP calls on province to ask military for help in 4th wave of COVID-19

	

	

	While the federal government is ready to help, Hajdu reminded Merriman it takes time to deploy these resources, and that equipment is easier to ship out than healthcare workers.

	“It depends on the resourcing needs of Saskatchewan, which is why it’s so critical that the province be looking ahead to what they anticipate they’ll need as they try to deal with the surge,” said Hajdu in a phone interview.

	She said the province has yet to make any official requests.

	Merriman’s office did not respond to an interview request, and the health minister last took open questions from the media one month ago.

	CTV News did obtain a letter from the minister to Hajdu.

	“I want to thank you for extending the offer that you have made in terms of federal assistance if the province of Saskatchewan requires it,” reads the letter from Merriman.

	“At this time, we have expanded the capacity in our acute and intensive care units in order to address pressures we are experiencing, and we will to continue to use the federal resources that have always been in place to complement those efforts.”

	Merriman did, however, request expedited approval for rapid tests and distribution of antibody therapies.

	 The offer from Ottawa comes as Saskatchewan continues to break COVID-19 records. On Sunday the province recorded more than 550 new cases, its highest new daily case count since the start of the pandemic. Those cases pushed the province to an all-time high of 4,864 active cases.

	Dr. Alex Wong, an infectious disease specialist, said this wave feels different than others.

	“People are just so sad and regretful they’re asking for the vaccine, they’re begging for the vaccine,” said Wong.

	

	

	Wong said the next two weeks will be critical in determining where the curve is headed, adding the biggest challenge will be healthcare staffing. He agreed with the federal minister that a proactive approach to securing resources is the way to go.

	""In no way shape or form do I think we’re even close to getting out of this,"" Wong said.

	""We need to have some consistent messaging in place about where we’re at right now and how dire the situation is.""

	Wong is calling on the province to introduce short, immediate measures to cut down transmission. He said those calls don't include lockdowns, but rather limits on gathering sizes and expanding contact tracing.

	The official opposition has previously called on Premier Scott Moe to formally ask Ottawa for help.

	The NDP says it’s time for the province to consider bringing in the Canadian military to help in many ways like contact tracing, testing and on the frontlines.

	Last Wednesday, the province said it is in regular contact with the federal government about the pandemic response. While it has asked for additional rapid test kits, there have been no other requests for federal support.​

"Alberta ICU staff say they're strained by rising demand for care, increasing backlash from patients ","Sept. 26, 2021 1:21 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	With Alberta’s health-care system now the focus of a military mission, the people who work within it say they're reaching a breaking point as stress compounds with negative patient interactions.

	Dr. Erika MacIntyre, a critical care physician working in Edmonton’s Misericordia hospital ICU shared with CTV News Edmonton how some patients – who usually are not vaccinated – are verbally abusing health-care staff.

    Advertisement
    
	“There has been some individuals who have accused us of giving them COVID,” MacIntyre said. “That’s always a bit of an added stress because that is not the case.”

	She recalled another time where one ICU patient, whose condition had improved enough to be able to leave the ICU, offered harmful remarks to the very staff helping them recover.

	“On the way out of the ICU, this individual called us killers,” MacIntyre said.

	“Despite people’s vaccination status, despite their health, we do the best that we can to treat the individual,” MacIntyre added.

	

	

	She said the worst stress on health-care workers, however, is the fact that no one knows when the situation in hospitals will improve.

	“No day seems to be the same as the one before,” she added. “Everything is changing.

	“It’s so much change. It’s hard to even know what form of change to talk about at this present time; the changes to staffing, to where we are.

	“We don’t know when this is going to end. We all expect it to get worse before it gets better. So we’ve anticipated that.”

	THE DEAD MAKE WAY FOR THE DYING

	The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) told CTV News in a statement that after being called upon earlier this week, up to eight ICU nurses and aeromedical transport for critical care patients – both in and out-of-province – are ready to be deployable “within 24 hours.”

	Surge capacity in hospitals continues to be added in ICUs, with occupancy 89 per cent yesterday to 83 per cent Friday.

	That reduction is not necessarily good news, however.

	According to Alberta Health Services (AHS), that six per cent decrease occurred as 18 surge spaces opened in the past 24 hours and some patients either recovered or died.

	“It’s tragic that we are only able to keep pace with these sort of numbers because in part some of our ICU patients have passed away,” AHS CEO and president Dr. Verna Yiu said on Thursday. “This reality has a deep and lasting impact on our ICU teams.

	“We are facing a fragile balance,” she added.

	As of 12:15 p.m. Friday, there were 368 ICU beds open in Alberta, including 195 additional spaces – representing a 113 per cent increase over the baseline of 173 normal spaces, AHS said.

	There were 304 total patients in ICU, the vast majority who are COVID-19 positive.

	On Friday, the Central zone operated at more than 100 per cent of current capacity, with 26 ICU beds.

	The South and North zones were operating at 89 and 87 per cent, respectively. The South zone has 36 beds while the North zone has 15.

	The Edmonton zone, with 158 beds, had 84 per cent of current capacity filled while Calgary, with 133 ICU beds, had 75 per cent filled.

	Dr. Paul Parks, Alberta Medical Association president, told CTV News that adding surge beds or capacity in one area means taking away from others.

	“It’s a bit of a 'rob Peter to pay Paul,' every time we add a couple of beds, we impact the system somewhere else,” Parks said. “The whole point is that it’s not infinite.”

	Opposition leader Rachel Notley said the CAF assistance requested by the province is helpful but the premier needs to go beyond medical evacuation assistance.

	“I think that’s helpful but I think that’s a fraction of what we need,” Notley said.

	“What’s really sad is that we are having to call on the Canadian Armed Forces, that we are having to call on the federal government and other provinces,” the Alberta NDP leader added. “We’ve allowed it (our system) to collapse to a scandalous level of incompetence. That needs to stop.”

	“At that point, it may show some significant difference (in ICU admissions).”

	According to Health Canada, the province ranks last in the country for vaccination rates. 

	Masri said low vaccination rates directly translate into what he sees in Saskatoon’s intensive care units.

	“Almost all of our patients are unvaccinated,” Masri said.

	“Our ICUs are full and we expect the situation to worsen quite a bit over the next few days.”

	Saskatchewan did see a bump in COVID-19 immunizations after Premier Scott Moe announced on Sept. 17 that a proof-of-vaccination policy would come into effect on Oct. 1.

	From Sept. 18-24, health-care workers administered nearly 25,000 total doses of vaccine – an increase of about 9,500 from Sept. 11-17. The average number of first shots given each day doubled, jumping from just over 1,000 to 2,114 the next week.

	“It won’t be until a good six weeks from now that they will be fully protected with the two doses of vaccine,” said epidemiologist Dr. Nazeem Muhajarine.

	“Six weeks in a Delta variant-driven surge is a long time.”

	Second doses also saw a slight boost. The average number of second shots per day was 1,187 for Sept. 11-17; that rose to 1,437 for Sept. 18-24.

	“Vaccination is an important way out of this pandemic, but it is not the only way,” Muhajarine said.

	“We also need several layers of protection.”

	Muhajarine said employee proof of vaccination should extend beyond government workers to places like schools and private corporations. He added, it is also time to reintroduce restrictions on social gatherings.

	Premier Scott Moe has previously encouraged businesses to follow suit in regards to the proof of vaccination requirements for government employees. Health officials have said they are monitoring hospitalization and new case numbers weekly, and further measures could be introduced, if necessary.

     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	The head of emergency medicine for the Alberta Medical Association, Dr. Paul Parks, says major components of triage have already begun in Alberta - an assertion disputed by the province.

	The dispute arose Friday as the Canadian Armed Forces prepared to bring in air transport and staff to deal with a COVID-19 crisis overwhelming Alberta's hospitals.

    Advertisement
    
	The province has yet to formally invoke the triage policy, which would see doctors have to make on-the-spot decisions over who gets life-saving resources.

	But Parks said it has become routine in hospitals in the last two weeks to have some critically ill patients - most of them unvaccinated COVID-19 cases - kept on main wards rather than in intensive care units on ventilators because they don't have the available intensive care ward staff.

	That's on top of previously announced mass cancellations of surgeries, along with patient transfers, as doctors balance medical needs with available space, he said.

	“We already are in positions in many hospitals across Alberta where the doctors know that it would be best for this patient to be in ICU and be on a ventilator, but we're not providing that option until they absolutely deteriorate to the point of crashing,” Parks said Friday.

	“We already are implementing some of these things that are drastic, and we wish we never would have.

	“People will suffer and will die by this.”

	Alberta Health Services said in a statement: “We acknowledge that we are operating at a reduced standard of care, however, safety remains at the forefront of all decisions.

	“Any patient who requires mechanical ventilation is currently able to receive it.”

	Parks said it's not at the point where doctors must make on-the-spot, life-and-death decisions. But he said that's not far away and, when it comes, the second stage of triage will follow quickly, including making those same decisions about children.

	Alberta Health Services said triage will only be invoked if all efforts to increase intensive care capacity are exhausted.

	There are 368 intensive care spaces with 304 patients, most of whom are critically ill with COVID-19, and most of them unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.

	Alberta normally has 173 intensive care spaces but has been converting other spaces, including operating rooms, into ad hoc critical care wards to meet COVID-19 demand.

	Alberta has more than 20,000 active COVID-19 cases and is seeing well over 1,000 new cases a day.

	Dr. Verna Yiu, head of Alberta Health Services, said Thursday a key reason intensive care wards have not been overwhelmed is because enough COVID-19 patients are dying to free up bed space.

	The number of COVID-19 deaths has been on the rise.

	There were 29 fatalities reported Tuesday, 20 more Wednesday and 17 Thursday. More than 2,600 people have died in Alberta since the pandemic began.

	Premier Jason Kenney has asked other provinces and the federal government for emergency aid.

	Andrew McKelvey, a spokesman with the Department of National Defence, said Friday that they have been asked to provide up to eight intensive care nurses, along with air transport for patients to other health facilities in Canada.

	The air transport should be ready to go in 24 hours and the nurses within 72 hours, said McKelvey.

	Parks and other physicians, meanwhile, are urging Kenney to put in a “firebreak” to reverse the slew of new infections, starting with shutting down schools and banning mass gatherings, such as sports events.

	“The (political) decision-makers upstream are not doing what they need to do to stop case transmission,” said Dr. Shazma Mithani, an Edmonton emergency room physician.

	“We can't keep going like this. Health care and ICU capacity is a finite resource.

	“The only way to stop the influx of patients into the hospitals is to stop the cases, and that has to happen with restrictions - and it is not happening.”

	Dr. Tehseen Ladha, an Edmonton pediatrician, said it makes no sense for Alberta to ask for federal help while refusing to impose serious health restrictions, particularly as cases among children rise.

	“This is the worst it's ever been,” said Ladha. “We're seeing the rise in cases amongst the (age) five-to-11 group go up faster than any other age group. The curve is almost vertical.”

	Dr. David Keegan, a Calgary family physician, said while critical cases grow, so does the collateral damage of thousands of delayed surgeries.

	Keegan said one of his patients needs cancer surgery, but the operation has been delayed.

	“It means by the time surgery happens you never know, (the cancer) may have spread,” he said.

	“Suddenly we go from this person with an easily treatable removable cancer to it has spread and we're into added-on chemotherapy and potentially radiation.”

	Dr. Ilan Schwartz, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta, said targeted public health measures and a vaccine passport may have worked a month ago.

	But he said only a hard lockdown with a shutdown of schools and on-essential businesses can now stop the crisis at its source - high caseloads.

	“It's absurd that we have (hospital) wards that are full, we are cancelling cancer surgeries, we're calling for the military, we're talking about transporting patients 3,000 kilometres in order for them to find an ICU bed and we still have society going on as if nothing is the matter.”

       P.E.I. reports three new COVID-19 cases Tuesday; will introduce vaccine passport on Oct. 5

	Although they are not currently in the province, they are still considered P.E.I. cases.

	The other three recently travelled outside of Atlantic Canada and are self-isolating.

	None of the cases are related to the outbreak at West Royalty Elementary School.

	There is a public exposure notification related to one of the cases:

	
		Sobeys Stratford (9 Kinlock Road)
	
		Tuesday, Sept. 21 from 11:30 am to 12:30 pm


	Public health says anyone who was at this location during these times should monitor for symptoms and if any develop, even if they are mild, visit a drop-in testing site.

	The province currently has 39 active cases of COVID-19 and has had 293 positive cases since the pandemic began.

	VACCINE UPDATE

	As of Saturday, September 18, a total of 251,706 doses of vaccine have been administered in P.E.I. meaning 93.2 per cent of the eligible population have received at least one dose and 85.7 per cent received two doses.

	All Islanders are urged to get tested if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19, even after a previous negative test, and to self-isolate until the results come back.

	Anyone age 12 and over can make an appointment to receive their COVID-19 vaccination at one of the public clinics online or by calling 1-844-975-3303; those age 18 years or older can also make an appointment by contacting one of the 28 partner pharmacies across the province.

	One new case was identified in the province's Northern zone, involving a close contact of a previously reported case.

	One new case was identified in the province's Western zone, and is under investigation.

	Public Health says it is closely monitoring all four health zones for community spread.

	OFFICIALS RESPOND TO RISING CASE NUMBERS

	With case numbers continuing to rise in Nova Scotia, and neighbouring New Brunswick reinstating a state of emergency, health officials continue to preach caution and vaccines to Nova Scotians.

	""We are encouraging people if they are not vaccinated to get vaccinated, it's the best protection that they have,” said N.S. Health Minister Michelle Thompson.

	With 169 active cases, the list of potential exposure sites continues to grow. Many of the locations in the Central Zone are restaurants or bars.

	""Honestly, I think it's a bit ridiculous for us to be listed as exposure site when we're only sector in all that list that has all these measures in place, such as contact tracing, such as the vaccination passports and they need to focus on other sectors that do not have as many restrictions as the restaurant/ hospitality sector,” said Luc Erjavec with Restaurants Canada.

	Dr. Robert Stang said Friday there are no plans to limit the hours bars and restaurants can operate, as the province did during the third wave.

	""That's why we're bringing in the proof of vaccine policy. Right now, we're allowing in with Phase four, limits on gatherings, both vaccinated and unvaccinated. Starting October 4, it will only be vaccinated people in things like bars, restaurants, gyms and a number of other discretionary operations,” said Strang.

	""We are in a very different circumstance in this wave where it is a wave of the unvaccinated which is why the vaccine passport or policy is very important,” said NS Liberal leader Iain Rankin.

	With COVID cases rising across the country, Premier Tim Houston said now is not the time to stop paying attention to Public Health.

	""The epidemiology is certainly changing and we need to be mindful and respectful of that,” he said.

	Health officials will make a final decision next week about whether masks will stick around when the province enters the fifth phase of its reopening on October 4.

	""If we look around the rest of the country where people have relaxed masking and then had to bring it back, I don't think people should be surprised if we continue to use mandatory masking in indoor public places beyond October 4,” said Strang.

	Meanwhile, the leader of the Nova Scotia NDP said the government needs to reach out to those who are unvaccinated and identify the obstacles they face.

	""Let us reach out to the places where people, identify those people, identify the support that's needed and see that the support's provided,” said Gary Burrill.

	COVID-19 CASE DATA

	Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 4,241 tests on Thursay. A total of 1,193,575 COVID-19 tests have been processed since the start of the pandemic.

	There were 3,577 tests administered between Sept. 17 and Sept. 23 at the rapid-testing pop-up sites in Halifax and Dartmouth.

	According to the province's online COVID-19 dashboard, there have been 6,486 cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nova Scotia. Of those, 6,222 people have recovered and 95 have died due to COVID-19.

	There are currently 14 people in hospital in Nova Scotia due to COVID-19, with one patient in an intensive care unit.

	Since August 1, there have been 590 positive COVID-19 cases and one death. Of the new cases since August 1, 420 are now considered resolved.

	There are cases confirmed across the province, but most have been identified in the Central zone, which contains the Halifax Regional Municipality.

	The provincial government says cumulative cases by zone may change as data is updated in Panorama, the province’s electronic information system.

	The numbers reflect where a person lives and not where their sample was collected.

	
		Western zone: 331 cases (9 active case)
	
		Central zone: 4,998 cases (129 active cases)
	
		Northern zone: 500 cases (22 active cases)
	
		Eastern zone: 657 cases (9 active cases)


	The provincial state of emergency, which was first declared on March 22, 2020, has been extended to Oct. 3, 2021.

	BREAKTHROUGH DATA

	Public Health reports 'breakthrough cases' weekly. A breakthrough case involves a person becoming COVID-19 positive two weeks after receiving either one or two doses of COVID-19 vaccine.

	According to Public Health, there have been 4,767 cases from March 15 to Sept. 23. Of those:

	
		133 (2.8 per cent) were fully vaccinated
	
		297 (6.2 per cent) were partially vaccinated
	
		4,337 (91.0 per cent) were unvaccinated


	There were 260 people hospitalized. Of those:

	
		6 (2.2 per cent) were fully vaccinated
	
		28 (10.3 per cent) were partially vaccinated
	
		237 (87.5 per cent) were unvaccinated


	Twenty-nine people died. Of those:

	
		2 (6.9 per cent) was fully vaccinated
	
		3 (10.3 per cent) were partially vaccinated
	
		24 (82.8 per cent) were unvaccinated


	VACCINE UPDATE

	The province's COVID-19 online dashboard provides an update on the number of vaccines that have been administered to date.

	As of Friday, 1,496,634 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered.

	In total, 80 per cent of the province's overall population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 74.1 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their second dose

	The province says it has received a total of 1,661,340 doses of COVID-19 vaccine since Dec. 15.

	All Nova Scotians are encouraged to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as they are eligible. COVID-19 vaccination appointments can be made online or by phone at 1-833-797-7772.

	COVID ALERT APP

	Canada’s COVID-19 Alert app is available in Nova Scotia.

	The app, which can be downloaded through the Apple App Store or Google Play, notifies users if they may have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.

	LIST OF SYMPTOMS

	Anyone who experiences a fever or new or worsening cough, or two or more of the following new or worsening symptoms, is encouraged to take an online test or call 811 to determine if they need to be tested for COVID-19:

	
		Sore throat
	
		Headache

Manitoba funds clinics to help Indigenous people get vaccinated against COVID-19,"Sept. 25, 2021 6:15 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	The Manitoba government is investing in helping increase vaccination rates among First Nations, Metis and Inuit people.

	The province announced on Friday that it is investing nearly $2.8 million to go towards supporting and expanding the roles of urban Indigenous vaccine clinics.

	The investment is in partnership with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO).

	Of the investment, $2.1 million is earmarked to extend the clinics at the Aboriginal Health and Wellness Centre and Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata location in Winnipeg until December 2021.

	Another $250,000 will also go to these organizations for mobile vaccine clinics which will operate in Downtown Winnipeg and in Point Douglas neighbourhoods which will include door-to-door outreach.

	Clinics in Portage la Prairie, Thompson and Brandon will also be extended until the end of the year with a $347,000 investment. Those clinics include the Portage la Prairie Renewal Corporation, Ma-Mow-We-Tak Friendship Centre in Thompson, and the Brandon Friendship Centre.

	A new staff position will open up at Ongomiizwin Health Services with a $65,000 investment. This position will be a liaison between the vaccine task force, Indigenous governance organizations, and vaccine providers.

	Lastly, $33,000 will go to immunization clinics that were held by the Manitoba Inuit Association that happened earlier this year.

	David Monias, Vice-Chief of the MKO, said he is happy to see the government is stepping up to help the Indigenous community.

	""We can only do this in unity, we can only do it together, to fight together, to protect our citizens, the most vulnerable people,"" said Monias.

	Mayor Brian Bowman added this is an important step in removing barriers for people to be vaccinated.

	""We're all Manitobans, we're all Canadians and our battle is against this virus,"" said Bowman.

	With the investment, the Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre and the Aboriginal Health and Wellness Centre are now open to all community members in addition to Indigenous people.

	The centres will also provide influenza vaccines in the fall and youth catch-up immunizations for anyone who has missed vaccines over the last two years.

	Della Herrera, the executive director of the Aboriginal Health and Wellness Centre, said this investment allows the centre to support those living in encampments.

	""Our goal is to visit every encampment under the bridge community in as many populated meeting hubs as we can over the next three months,"" said Herrera. ""This extension will allow us to provide QR codes and vaccine cards to our community.""

	Dr. Marcia Anderson, the public health lead of the Manitoba First Nation Pandemic Response Coordination Team, said as of Thursday vaccine coverage for people living on reserve is over 90 per cent, and added that only 16 per cent of people in hospital are First Nations and there is only one First Nations person in ICU with COVID-19.

Oilers' unvaccinated Archibald out 'until he can get up to speed': Dave Tippett,"Sept. 24, 2021 5:37 a.m. CST","

	When the Edmonton Oilers took to the ice at Rogers Place on Thursday for the first official team skate ahead of the 2021-22 NHL season, there was one player conspicuously absent.

	Oilers forward Josh Archibald made headlines on Wednesday when it was revealed by general manager Ken Holland that he remained unvaccinated against COVID-19.

    Advertisement
    
	On Thursday, the 28-year-old winger was left off the list for the Oilers team skate.

	When asked about Archibald's status on Thursday, Oilers head coach Dave Tippett said the forward ""just came out of a 14-day quarantine.""

	""No skating, no nothing, so until he can get up to speed with where the group is, he won't be with the main group.""

	Oilers captain Connor McDavid gave a somewhat diplomatic response when asked about the situation on Thursday morning.

	""The vaccine has become such a political thing,"" he told reporters. ""It's something a lot more than just a vaccine at this point.""

	""Obviously we want to do our best to protect one another, but ultimately it's everyone's choice to take it or not.""

	Archibald is the only member of the Edmonton Oilers who has not received a COVID-19 vaccine.

	""It's everyone's choice to take it or not,"" said McDavid. ""Everyone's responsible and has a choice and control of their own body and if someone feels the need not to get it, or doesn't want to get it, that’s their choice and you move on.""

	The topic was vehemently avoided on Thursday by Oilers goalie Mike Smith.

	""Way above my paygrade,"" the veteran goaltender said when asked about the vaccination status of his teammates.

	""I'm not going to talk about vaccinations, COVID. I want to talk about hockey… There's doctors that are way more knowledgeable about it than I am.""

	'BITTER TASTE IN MY MOUTH'

	At 39 years old, Smith's chances of taking home a Stanley Cup are dwindling.

	On Thursday, the Kingston, Ont., native said his team's Round 1 defeat at the hands of the Winnipeg Jets served as motivation for him to do better this season.

	""There was definitely a bitter taste in my mouth,"" said Smith. ""I proved to myself that I could play at a high level at my age.""

	""It kind of gave me the drive to keep going.""

	The Jets swept the Oilers before moving on to Round 2.

	After signing a two-year, US$4.4-million extension with the Oilers over the summer, Smith is expected to edge fellow veteran goaltender Mikko Koskinen for playing time in the upcoming season. 

	""At some point in the season you need both guys to be playing well and both guys to contribute to team success,"" said Smith.

	EVAN BOUCHARD 'CARRIES HIMSELF LIKE AN NHL PLAYER NOW'

	As one Edmonton Oilers' playing career draws near its end, another's is just beginning.

	With 21 career NHL games under his belt, the Oilers' 2018 first round draft pick, Evan Bouchard, still doesn't have much experience at the top level. 

	When asked about the 21-year-old defenceman on Thursday, Tippett's assessment of the young player was optimistic.

	""He went over in Europe, played half a year. Continued to play, continued to grow, mature as a player,"" said Tippett. ""He came back and probably didn't play as much as he'd like to play, but every day he was working with our group.""

	Tippett said the 2018 10th overall pick has been spending extra time in practice and attends every meeting.

	""He understands what we're doing as a team,"" said Tippett. ""This year, the difference that I see in him, he's gone from being a young player to he looks like a man… He carries himself like an NHL player now.""

	When asked about his previous NHL season, during which he played in only 14 games, Bouchard called it a ""learning experience.""

	""Now having the opportunity to slot in. It's going to be a big camp for me and I'm going to show what I can do.

	The young player said training with fellow Oilers' defenceman Darnell Nurse on smaller ice surfaces over the offseason was a good opportunity to get better. 

	""(Nurse) is one of the hardest working guys I know,"" said Bouchard. 

	""Getting the opportunity to skate with him, see how hard he works, and I think being on the smaller ice was good for the two of us being a bit bigger, you know, really working on your quick feet and get into the smaller zones really helps a lot.""

	For Bouchard, the hope is that hard work pays off going into this season.

	""We're going to give him a great opportunity,"" said Tippett. ""We need him to take a step forward for us and I have full confidence that he's going to do that.""

	The Oilers next big test will be against the Calgary Flames when they faceoff for their first pre-season game on Sunday.

Alberta food court operators call on province to remove closures and allow indoor dining ,"Sept. 24, 2021 9:51 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Food court operators in Alberta say they are being unfairly targeted after the province ordered their businesses to ban all indoor dining.

	The original plan announced on Friday from the UCP government was to allow all eateries to use the Restrictions Exemption Program and require proof of vaccination for all customers, but that messaging changed over the weekend.

    Advertisement
    
	“We feel that food courts were singled out in the province by removing the seating on very short notice, as early as Saturday morning in some places,” said co-founder of 98 Food Co., Jason Cunningham.

	“All the national landlords were preparing to have security checks for vaccine proof.”

	Cunningham operates a wide variety of food outlets in Calgary and says it makes no sense for the province to allow customers to dine in at restaurants, while at the same time closing food courts.

	“We don't think they're very social environments like a late-night restaurant, there's no alcohol served at our establishments,” he said.

	“There are socially-distanced tables and chairs often fixed to the floor. People visit the food court for 15 or 20 minutes as food on the go, yet you can go to a white tablecloth dining room and sit there for five hours if you like -- we don't think that's fair at all.”

	Takeout service is still allowed for food court operators, but Cunningham says sales could be impacted by as much as 80 per cent as work from home orders are implemented.

	He added that rents for food court operators are amongst the highest per square foot than any other food service in the province.

	“Don't penalize them at all, open up food courts so not only the small businesses can manage better, but it gives lower income families an equal opportunity to go out and dine as well.”

	B.C. FOOD COURTS REMAIN OPEN

	No dates have been given by the Alberta Government as to when food courts could re-open, but other provinces like British Columbia have opted to keep food courts open.

	In B.C., food courts are not only allowed to stay open, but also considered safer because they are considered takeout services and therefore exempted from requiring proof of vaccination.

	General Manager of CF Market Mall, Darren Milne said his mall was prepared to implement the Restrictions Exemption Program, which would see attendants request proof of vaccination at both of the food courts entrances.

	Milne said that option has been rejected and has since made it more difficult to control crowding at the mall.

	“People just find other places in the mall to go eat and so we're finding people eating in back hallways or in stairwells or on the floor,” he said.

	“When that happens we can't control the number of people who are together, we can't control the garbage and we can't control the sanitization of the tables or the areas of eating, so we think it's really important for food court seating to be open.”

	'WE’RE HUGELY IMPACTED': CALGARY FARMERS’ MARKET 

	The Calgary Farmers’ Market South has also been impacted by the move as it was forced to remove all 60 of its tables in its food hall, which could hold up to 250 people at any given time.

	Brittany Fitzgerald is the facility’s marketing and operations coordinator and says 25 family businesses are now seeing a huge reduction in sales.

	“A food court is specifically for fast food and our food hall is all for family run businesses just like any restaurant,” she said.

	“In the past, we've had to work with previous government regulations, we've had our tables spaced out six feet apart, and we've always followed all health protocols so this doesn’t make sense.”

	Phil Faba, who owns the Stock and Sauce Company within the farmers' market, noted that his livelihood is dependent on customers coming in and dining in person.

	“There is no traffic over here, there are businesses directly near the food hall and feeling it, so we have a down profit right now of about 30 to 50 per cent every time we shut down,” Faba said.

	“We’re being penalized just for the situation that we're in, but if I owned my own restaurant, I'd have the same ability as every other restaurant to serve customers dine-in service.”

	PROVINCE RESPONDS TO FOOD COURT OPERATORS

	CTV News contacted Alberta Health for an explanation on why food courts and food halls were closed, while dine-in service for restaurants remained open under the Restrictions Exemption Program.

	The following response from Tom McMillan, Alberta Health assistant director of communications did not specify why food courts were singled out. 

	“Indoor dining, including food courts, was closed as these settings are places where individuals are removing masks and in close contact for a long duration of time,” McMillan’s statement read.

	“At this time, food courts are open to takeout only. They remain closed for in-person dining due to the open-access nature of mall food courts and typically the lack of attendants who can ensure public health measures and other requirements are followed.”

	“We appreciate businesses and patrons’ patience as we continue to respond to COVID-19 and adjust our approach in Alberta if and as needed to protect the health care system and bend down the curve once again.”

NHLers weigh in on league's vaccine policy: 'I've gotta be careful with this one',"Sept. 25, 2021 5:51 a.m. CST","
     
    
	Nick Suzuki doesn't think he's ever skated faster.

	The Montreal Canadiens centre had played 61 consecutive regular-season and playoff contests inside cavernous arenas devoid of spectators.

    Advertisement
    
	Then things changed, if only a little. But it certainly meant more than Suzuki could have ever imagined.

	The Quebec government lifted some of its COVID-19 restrictions -- among them a province-wide curfew -- in late May, allowing the Canadiens to welcome 2,500 fans into the Bell Centre for Game 6 of their first-round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs.

       NHL camps open as teams take stock of unvaccinated playersNHL expects 98 per cent of players to be vaccinated before seasonNHL to punish unvaccinated players more harshly this seasonNHLer Tyler Bertuzzi is only unvaccinated Detroit Red Wings player, will miss games in Canada

	""I felt unbelievable,"" Suzuki said of playing in front of just 12 per cent capacity. ""The energy that they created for us was amazing.

	""I don't know how we played without them, to be honest.""

	It was a long winter and spring of 2021 for NHL players and fans in Canada. While arenas in the U.S. gradually opened as coronavirus vaccine rates ramped up, venues stayed almost entirely shut north of the border thanks to a slower rollout and more stringent regulations.

	Montreal beat Toronto in overtime in that first NHL game in Canada with paying fans since March 2020, and after winning Game 7 on the road two nights later to complete the comeback from a 3-1 series deficit, would again suit up in front of 2,500 supporters twice in the Canadiens' equally surprising second-round sweep of the Winnipeg Jets.

	Attendance was boosted to 3,500 fans for both the third round against the Vegas Golden Knights and the Stanley Cup final with the Tampa Bay Lightning, who downed Montreal in five games for their second straight title.

	""I kind of felt numb because we didn't have fans for such a long period,"" Suzuki said looking back on that first night when faces returned to the crowd. ""I was like, 'Maybe it's the same.'

	""Then all of a sudden we had them back ... it changes the whole atmosphere.""

	Canadian NHL teams are set for fans to return this season as the league resumes an 82-game schedule and its regular division setup.

	The seven franchises only played against each other until the semifinals last season because of border restrictions, meaning blaring music and artificial noise took the place of 20,000 voices inside arenas.

	""Definitely excited to have the fans back in the building,"" Calgary Flames winger Andrew Mangipane said.

	""And not hearing the fake crowd noise.""

	Toronto welcomes Montreal to Scotiabank Arena in exhibition play Saturday -- Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment announced Friday capacity will be 50 per cent after Ontario loosened restrictions -- for the venue's first event with paying customers since March 10, 2020.

	""Oh my God, we missed it so much,"" Toronto winger William Nylander said. ""You know how much the team loves the fans, what the fans mean to us, and what we mean to the fans.

	""It'll be so nice to have them back.""

	The Leafs and Ottawa Senators hope to host capacity crowds for their regular-season openers, while the Jets also expect to play in front of full houses this season.

	The Flames and Edmonton Oilers are currently allowed to fill their arenas despite Alberta being under a state of public health emergency due to a COVID-19 surge.

	The Vancouver Canucks are limited to 50 per cent capacity, but the team has said it hopes restrictions will be eased. Montreal is permitted to play in front of 33 per cent capacity as things stand.

	Each NHL rink in Canada will require proof of vaccination for fans to attend, save for Edmonton's Rogers Place, which is also accepting a negative COVID-19 test.

	Players were asked repeatedly before the pandemic-shortened season how they would deal with the empty buildings. Most put on a brave face and talked about being professionals with the ability to self-motivate, but it was more difficult than expected in a jam-packed season with little downtime.

	""(Picture) a Monday night (in Vancouver), and no fans and you're tired,"" Canadiens winger Tyler Toffoli said. ""You know that you have to fly six hours after the game. You're just dreading that. You need that extra little motivation ... it was definitely tough.

	""Mentally, it was the hardest year of my entire career.""

	Canucks goalie Thatcher Demko said some NHLers might have taken what the boisterous crowds bring for granted before the pandemic.

	""It put a lot of perspective in the minds of the players as far as what the fans mean to the game,"" he said.

	Winnipeg centre Mark Scheifele found the lack of crowd-influenced momentum swings noticeable both at home and on the road.

	""A big save or a blocked shot or a big goal ... there's only a goal horn,"" he said. ""You don't get the full appreciation.""

	""It can be a little hit on the boards and people are going nuts,"" Oilers defenceman Darnell Nurse added. ""You don't know how much you miss it until you don't have fans.""

	Jets head coach Paul Maurice said the situation even impacted the people standing behind the bench.

	""We were truly segregated,"" he said of last season. ""And what did we learn? We learned that we need our fans to enjoy our job -- we truly do.

	""I didn't enjoy parts of my job that I always used to love, and that's games. I love going to the rink. And there's nobody in the building and you're going kind of like, 'What are we doing? This is no fun.'

	""It was just no fun.""

	Winnipeg centre Pierre-Luc Dubois does his best to ignore the crowd, but noticed a difference as last season ground on.

	""Teams did the best they could,"" he said. ""But there's nothing like a fan borderline giving you the finger, slamming on the glass and telling you that you suck. There's nothing like hearing that sometimes.

	""That's definitely something I missed.""

	He finally got to experience it again at the Bell Centre during the playoffs.

	""I was in the penalty box and the fans are chanting my name to mock me,"" Dubois recalled. ""But little did they know, I had a smile on my face.

	""I'm like, 'Ah, they're back. Finally, we're back.""'

	And that was just the start.

	Officials in Guelph issued an open letter to students on Thursday urging them to avoid large gatherings in the wake of a ""worrying trend"" of on-campus parties.

       Two teens arrested at gathering of hundreds on University of Guelph campus: police

	There have been two confirmed large gatherings on campus at the University of Guelph since the school year began. Two teenagers were arrested at a gathering this past weekend, although neither were students.

	The university's home opener football game is this Saturday.

	The letter reiterates that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, adding students can do their part to protect themselves and others from infection.

	""Being vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself from the most serious outcomes of COVID-19 and its many variants. However, no vaccine is 100-per-cent effective. Without taking other precautions, you can still become infected and infect others who may be more vulnerable to serious illness,"" the letter states.

	On top of avoiding large parties, students are being reminded to physically distance and wear masks, even outside, when a two metre distance cannot be maintained.

	""Avoid large gatherings, especially if you don’t know who is vaccinated and who is not. Drinking, eating, shouting and singing in crowded spaces all increase the odds of transmission,"" the letter said. ""Reconsider your party plans. Socialize in small groups and with people you know. Stay home if you are unwell.""

	The letter also reminds students of the consequences associated with hosting parties over the COVID-19 limits. Hosts of large gatherings can be fined up to $10,000 and attendees $880. Noise and nuisance tickets can range from $365 to $615.

	The University of Guelph's non-academic misconduct policy applies to behaviour on and off-campus. Defying that policy can result in fines, non-academic probation, suspension and eviction from residence, the letter states.

	""Do not put yourself, or the in-person school year we want to offer you, at risk. We have all done so well in the past 18 months to slow the spread of COVID-19,"" the letter concludes. ""Let’s continue being vigilant so we can fully reopen our campus and community.""

'No margin for error': Albertans look for immediate impact from restrictions as COVID-19 cases climb ,"Sept. 24, 2021 9:01 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	As Alberta's latest round of COVID-19 health measures take hold, experts are predicting a dicey stretch — but there is reason to believe case numbers could soon decrease.

	The number of daily new cases reported has been above 1,300 for two and a half weeks, but the rolling average is somewhat levelling off.

	Infectious disease expert Dr. Craig Jenne says he's hoping new rules around masking and mandatory vaccination will make an even bigger dent on the figures.

	""We simply have no margin for error,"" he said. ""There's no room, no care left. We need to make sure these numbers stop rising and begin to decline rapidly.""

	The province's health care system has taken a major hit in September. 

	COVID-19 patients are flooding the facilities and surge capacity is quickly filling. 

	Help is on the way from Ottawa, but even as case numbers climb, Albertans will likely still be facing another week of growing hospital admissions.

	Hospitalizations are a lagging indicator, which means they'll take longer to be impacted by the new restrictions. But, in other jurisdictions, similar health measures were able to bring hospital admissions and ICU numbers to a manageable level. 

	In British Columbia, rapidly-climbing cases were all but levelled out by a strict vaccine passport mandate. 

	Alberta's newest round of rules are less stringent, but experts believe they'll still have an effect on what is becoming a dire situation. 

	""(Alberta's) rate of growth has declined to, instead of five or six per cent a day, down to two per cent a day,"" said Dean Karlen of the B.C. Modelling Group.

	""So that's in the right direction. In British Columbia, we were growing at two per cent a day about a month ago. Now we're down to zero.""

	Still, Jenne says there's no reason to become complacent. 

	""We're hoping that this means we're starting to plateau,"" he told CTV News. ""But this plateau is still unmanageably high.""

	Athletes and staff would have to opportunity to obtain a medical or religious exemption to the mandate, the USOPC said.

	Hirshland said the USOPC had hoped COVID-19 restrictions would be lifted by the end of the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games but in reality the pandemic is ""far from over.""

	""This step will increase our ability to create a safe and productive environment for Team USA athletes and staff, and allow us to restore consistency in planning, preparation and service to athletes,"" she said.

	The move has the support of the Athletes' Advisory Council and National Governing Bodies Council, she said, which was further reinforced by the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the Pfizer vaccine and the recent mandates by the U.S. federal government.

"Alberta carnivals, festivals permitted during public health emergency ","Sept. 24, 2021 5:40 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	As health-care workers struggle with a fourth wave of COVID-19 patients, other Albertans are able to go to weekend carnivals and festivals sanctioned by health officials and approved by the UCP government. 

	A state of public health emergency was declared by Premier Jason Kenney on Sept. 15 as patients requiring intensive care hit all-time record numbers.

    Advertisement
    
	Still, in an effort to keep the economy going, Alberta is allowing businesses including festivals and carnivals to continue outdoors without vaccine rules – causing confusion and drawing criticism from some.

	Responding to concern from residents, Slave Lake’s mayor clarified that he had no say in the carnival setting up in his town this week, because it’s happening on private land.

	“This approval does not go through council!! My understanding is they have approval from AHS and it is up to AHS to monitor and enforce in the event. It is my hope that AHS does so. You should not expect to see me at a carnival this weekend,” Tyler Warman wrote on Facebook.

	A commenter on the post called the event “dangerous,” and another said it was “surprising” that this was being allowed.



	

	Others were happy that Wild Rose Shows Inc. was setting up in town.

	“Don’t go if you’re worried,” commenter Jim Buchholtz wrote on a Town of Slave Lake post explaining the situation.

	Wild Rose also had a show scheduled for Sept. 23-26 in Red Deer.

	An employee told CTV News Edmonton over the phone that they were trying to save a family business after months of being shut down.

	A spokesperson with the company did not return a request for further comment.

	Alberta Health confirmed carnivals and other outdoor events are still allowed, and do not require special approval provided “social distancing is maintained between households.”

	Outdoor events also do not require vaccine passports and there is no limit on capacity.

	Several other festivals were also still scheduled to proceed through the health emergency.

	The Lethbridge Electronic Music Festival was planned for Saturday in downtown Lethbridge and the Heritage Inn International Balloon Festival was still a go in High River.

	Organizers of both events did have to change plans to allow for the outside 2m distancing rule, their advertisements said.

	The Edmonton International Film Festival planned to push on too. Running Oct. 1-10, organizers clarified safety rules in a Facebook post.

	“We’re making it safer and more intimate while creating more space and keeping the same excitement and togetherness that guests have come to expect from a visit to the cinemas,” it read.

	“All attendees will be asked to adhere to the health and safety guidelines that we’ve developed, along with public health requirements.”

	Alberta announced 20 new COVID-19 related deaths Wednesday and Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province’s chief medical officer of health repeated similar health advice.

	“Our actions, such as going out while symptomatic, have very real consequences to those around us. Staying home when we feel unwell, wearing our masks when out in public, & getting vaccinated are critical to limiting the potential spread,” she wrote on Twitter.

	‘Madness’ to still allow big events: Gibney

	“If you look at where we are…we’re in a crisis like we’ve never been in before. We’re begging other provinces to help us take ICU patients,” Dr. Noel Gibney, a medical professor at the University of Alberta, said Thursday.

	Alberta was seeing record numbers of hospitalizations and ICU patients, and the province’s death rate from COVID-19 was the highest in Canada.

	Gibney believes outdoor events are not overly dangerous for COVID-19 transmission, if everyone follows the rules, but said the message it sends to allow parties to continue during a fourth wave was not helping Alberta.

	“The Stampede wasn’t a risk outdoors in the Stampede grounds. The problem is when people celebrate, they go out to the festival in the day time and then they go out to the bars and restaurants at night. And that’s where the trouble happens, when people come together indoors,” he said.

	“If we don’t have the message sent that we’re in a crisis, people are just going to carry on with their lives as if nothings happening until their family member gets sick. Even if they don’t get Covid, and they crash their car, there will be no ICU bed for them.”

	Gibney said his best advice for Albertans is to stay home as much as possible, in an effort to ease the burden on already overworked healthcare staff.

       Pfizer Canada cites 'urgency' in plans to seek authorization for kids' COVID vaccine

	“How will it affect the kids in a longer time? As far as their health is concerned, as far as their growth is concerned,” wondered Monika Parmar, also the parent of a school-aged child.

	On Monday, Pfizer released preliminary information from a phase 2/3 trial of their COVID-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11. According to a company press release the trial involved “a two-dose regimen of 10 µg administered 21 days apart, a smaller dose than the 30 µg dose used for people 12 and older.”

	“As [trial participants] are getting down littler and littler, we’re seeing littler and littler doses but what they’re looking to see is to make sure it’s the same amount of antibodies regardless of the dose you got,“ said Kelly Grindrod, a member of the Region of Waterloo Vaccine Taskforce and a professor at the University of Waterloo’s School of Pharmacy. “That’s what these trials are actually looking at.”

	Summarizing the trial results, the Pfizer release stated, ""in participants 5 to 11 years of age, the vaccine was safe, well-tolerated and showed robust neutralizing antibody responses.""

	“They say that it’s safe which is great news,” Grindrod added. “This is actually very good news because it tells us that they're at the stage where we can start thinking about the approval of the vaccines for children but we know very little about what the data actually says so far.”

	South of the border, Pfizer is seeking authorization for the emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine in American children ages 5 to 11.

	Pfizer Canada told CTV News Kitchener they share an ""urgency"" to provide that data to Health Canada but were unable to provide a timeline of when they will formally submit it for approval.

	As for the logistics of how shots will get into arms, the rollout may be organized by each individual Health Unit.

	“We are working closely with local physicians to administer vaccines to this age group as soon as they’re approved for them,"" Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health said in a statement.

	WDG Public Health also stated the plan for this age group would likely see a combination of vaccinations done through appointments at mini-mass clinics, in doctor’s offices and in public health offices but reiterated the fact that plans are not yet concrete.

	Region of Waterloo Public Health said it is likely to continue the use of existing vaccine clinics but with a family twist. They are looking to make changes, taking lessons learned from clinic survey data.

	The health unit is also looking into the possibility of organizing after-school clinics.

	""Key partners, such as primary care and community pharmacies are collaborating with us on a variety of options up for consideration,"" said Sharon Ord, vaccine communications lead for Region of Waterloo Public Health.

	CTV News reached out to local school boards asking if they are working with health units to possibly administer shots but were directed back to public health officials.

	Ontario’s Ministry of Health said the province “continues to follow NACI’s guidelines that individuals who are born in 2009 or earlier are eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.”

	In a written statement, the Ministry added they are continuously monitoring evidence and are following the lead of Health Canada.

	“Working with our public health and health system partners we will be ready to administer doses to children aged five to 11 as soon as they are approved by Health Canada,"" the Ministry said.

	But when could a vaccine be approved?

	“It all depends what the data shows. They go over this data especially for kids extremely carefully,” Grindrod explained.

	There have been speculations the United States may begin vaccinating younger children by the end of October, but Grindrod hinted that timeline seems a little ambitious for Canadians given Pfizer hasn’t officially submitted its data for approval yet.

	“I think we have some confidence now it’s going to be likely before Christmas, likely before the new year. The question is when. Is it October? November? We don’t really know yet,” Grindrod said.

	Pfizer says trial results for children under the age of five may be available as soon as the end of the year.

	Five are the result of close contact with a positive case, three are community-acquired, two are travel-related, and one is outbreak-related. The remaining cases are under investigation.

	VACCINE CERTIFICATE TAKES EFFECT WEDNESDAY

	Over the past 18 months, businesses have had to pivot from lockdown measures to various safety protocols, and most recently, a new proof of vaccine policy requiring workers to turn away customers without evidence they are immunized against COVID-19.

	In an interview with CTV News last week, Ryan Mallough, director of provincial affairs for Ontario with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said that putting the onus on employees was a lot to ask.

	""Recovery is still very much in its infancy, and this is another burden both administrative and financial thrust upon small businesses.""

	Additionally, the question remains how will it be enforced?

	In a statement to CTV News, Barrie police said unless there is a public safety concern, criminal activity or legislative concerns, like trespassing, don't call them.

	Rather, the police service said to direct issues of compliance to the health unit.

	Meanwhile, the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit said education is key when the province's vaccine certificate comes into effect.

	A spokesperson for the health unit said it would be taking a ""graduated approach with emphasis on education"" to deal with compliance issues once specific indoor settings are required to have proof of vaccination to allow patrons to enter.

	Starting Wednesday, residents will have to show proof of being fully vaccinated for at least 14 days, or a medical exemption, along with a piece of ID to access a long list of non-essential businesses, including gyms, movie theatres and restaurants.

	Ontario's health minister said she doesn't expect major pushback from unvaccinated residents.

	Individuals caught not complying with the vaccine policy could face fines starting at $750. The fines for businesses start at $1,000.

PPC gains in rural Sask. add competition for Tories,"Sept. 22, 2021 4:45 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	Despite not winning a seat federally, the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) saw vote increases in rural Saskatchewan on election night.

	With some poll results still trickling in, the PPC has already vastly surpassed its 2019 vote totals in several Saskatchewan ridings. The new-for-2021 Maverick Party – born from the WEXIT movement – also siphoned some votes.

	In Saskatchewan rural ridings, PPC vote percentages at-least tripled across the board from 2019.

       'People aren't scared of COVID here': Few masks in sight at PPC headquarters on election night in SaskatoonMaxime Bernier says he will stay on as PPC leader, despite loss in Quebec ridingFederal election results for SaskatchewanBlue wave soaks Sask. in second consecutive federal election 

	University of Regina political scientist Jim Farney said PPC leader Maxime Bernier appeared to target Saskatchewan to increase the party's support among voters who want a right-wing political alternative.

	“Since Harper’s loss in 2015 – and you see it provincially, too, with the Buffalo Party – there’s an element of ‘the system needs to radically change, none of the options on the table are doing it for us.’ So that’s a big part of the story,” Farney said, in an interview with CTV Morning Live Regina.

	Joseph Angolano, vice president of Canadian polling firm Mainstreet Research, said the increase in PPC ballots is due to “protest votes” — traditional conservative voters switching their vote because they are upset with the current party platform.

	“[The PPC] did take second [and] it did take third in quite a few seats in southern Saskatchewan,” said Angolano. “I don’t know if that’s going to continue if we’re going to be having another election in 18 months or not, we don’t know, but it’ll be interesting to see what will happen

	Some of the most significant PPC gains were seen in Yorkton—Melville and Souris—Moose Mountain.

	RESULTS MAP: Track every result in our interactive map 

	In 2019, the PPC received 941 votes, or 2.4 per cent of the vote in Yorkton—Melville, giving them a last place finish in the riding. Not even two years later, that number has more than tripled to 3,150 votes, or 9.5 per cent, resulting in third place for candidate Braden Robertson.

	Cathay Wagantall, the newly re-elected Conservative Member of Parliament for the staunchly blue riding, said it was the right-wing competition that created the main challenges for her campaign in 2021.

	“We did have the Mavericks and the PPC running in this riding as well, so it gave people other options. Obviously more so on the right than we’ve faced in the past, it’s usually been more of a challenge from the left,” Wagantall said, after the announcement of her projected victory on Monday night.

	As of Tuesday morning, PPC candidate Diane Neufeld had 3,436 votes, or 9.2 per cent of the vote, claiming second place in Souris—Moose Mountain.

	Further north in Battlefords-Lloydminster, the PPC also saw smaller gains, likely due to a surge in support for the Maverick Party.

	With just one poll left to report, Ken Rutherford from the Maverick Party sat in third place with 2,113 votes, or 7.1 per cent of the vote, with Terry Sieben of the PPC close behind with 1,798 votes, or six per cent.

	Both parties fell behind the second place NDP, but received more votes than the Liberal and Green parties in that riding.

	The Maverick’s mission statement on their website said the party’s goal is “to achieve greater fairness and self-determination for western Canadians” through either constitutional change or the creation of an independent nation.

	Speaking in Saskatoon on election night, Bernier told PPC supporters he wants to end the “COVID hysteria.” Despite growth in the popular vote, the party did not win a single seat in the House of Commons.

	""This is not just a political party. It is a movement. It is an ideological revolution,"" Bernier said.

	""Unfortunately, we won't be able to carry on this fight in Parliament, but we will continue this battle to unite Canadians under the freedom umbrella.”

	Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said the improvement for the PPC in Saskatchewan and across the country could have been harnessed by the spread of misinformation throughout the pandemic and divisions within Canada.

	“It think it speaks to some of the divisions that were highlighted throughout this campaign,” Moe said during a Tuesday morning press conference. “Some of the divisions that we are seeing in the broader society across Canada and across Saskatchewan, and some of those divisions are coming through with some embracing some of the misinformation that is available out on social media and on the internet.”

	He added that he feels Maxime Bernier and the party attempted to “prolong the pandemic” by embracing anti-vaccine sentiments.

	Despite the boost, Farney is unsure whether the PPC will have staying power to hold onto their share of votes outside of the pandemic.

	“The question is, when we do get through COVID-19, does that alienation stay as strong as it seems to be right now,” Farney said.

	In total in 2019, the PPC received 1.8 per cent of the vote in Saskatchewan. Although results have not been finalized, the party will likely come out of 2021 with a much larger share.

On Monday alone, SOS said COVID-19 cases were reported at 12 different schools in Alberta, two schools moved to online learning and two reported outbreaks.   “The lack of reporting requirements, and contact tracing by AHS (Alberta Health Services) is definitely feeding into the anxiety of parents,” said Moussa. “Because there's so much unknown information, and  you're reliant on this volunteered information instead of required information and required isolation.”  On Friday, the Calgary Board of Education penned a letter to the UCP government over its concerns with COVID-19 in schools.   ""We are frustrated by the lack of coherent provincial guidance being provided to our families and students,"" the CBE said.   ""Families have received mixed messages about the real and substantial risk that COVID-19 presents to our communities, and school jurisdictions are left to fill the public health gap left by the government.""   Meanwhile, Calgary Catholic School District said Monday it recognizes the ""ongoing challenges of creating and safe learning environments in our schools during the fourth wave of COVID-19.""  ""Our board is currently in the process of communicating their concerns to the provincial government.""  SPIKE WAS AVOIDABLE: EXPERT  Infectious disease specialist Craig Jenne said the current spike of COVID-19 in school age children was avoidable.  “If we look back to last year, when we started school, we were able to get through most of September and October without substantial outbreaks,"" said Jenne. “We were just a little more careful. We had more universal masking. We had contact tracing, but perhaps critically, we had fewer viral cases in the community.”  University of Calgary's Craig Jenne infectious disease expert said the low vaccine rate among 20 to 29-year-olds could be a concern when school goes back to class in the fall  Jenne stressed the case jump in school aged children is not only coming from the return to school, but from increased community transmission as well.  He anticipates that as the emergency measures instituted last week start to mitigate community spread, cases among Alberta children will decline as well.  “The thing we should again, keep in mind is, it's going to take a week to two weeks to start seeing those cases (decline). We have brought in measures, the big question is, will it be enough? Will that flatten the curve? Or will it slow the curve? But we should be able to see an impact of these measures in the coming weeks on kids.”  At this time, Albertans under the age of 12 aren't eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, but that could soon change.  On Monday, Pfizer said its vaccine is proving effective in kids under 12, and it will be seeking authorization for the age group soon.  - With files from Sarah Reid

     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	When on-campus classes resumed Monday, it was with new requirements from some post-secondary institutions.

	The city's major post-secondary schools – which cancelled on-campus learning for two days to figure out how to apply Alberta's Restrictions Exemption Program – have released their plans for the remainder of the semester.

	When the Restrictions Exemption Program took effect Monday, it also took effect on the MacEwan University and University of Alberta campuses.

	Both institutions told students on Friday they would be participating in the Restrictions Exemption Program immediately.

	At the University of Alberta, as per the provincial Restrictions Exemption Program, unvaccinated staff and students were required to submit a negative COVID-19 test every 72 hours. As well, Monday was the deadline for students to have received their first dose of vaccine in time to comply with the school's vaccine mandate, which starts Nov. 1.

	Rapid testing will only be provided by the U of A after Oct. 29 to those who have been approved for a vaccine exemption.

	MacEwan University also immediately began participating in the Restrictions Exemption Program on Monday, requiring students to have at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine or a negative COVID-19 test. Vaccinated students were able to register their vaccine status through the school's app and portal, while negative COVID-19 tests couldn't be older than 72 hours.

	The school previously announced it would implement a vaccine mandate for the winter 2022 term, which would require all staff and students to be fully vaccinated to be on campus. At that point, negative tests will no longer be accepted for access. MacEwan has promised to waive tuition for five fully vaccinated students for the year's fall and winter terms. Administration said at the end of August 95 per cent of faculty and 86 per cent of students who participated in a voluntary survey had been fully immunized.

	NAIT, CONCORDIA TO OPT IN BY OCT.

	Alberta's Restrictions Exemption Program will take effect at Concordia University on Oct. 4 and at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology on Oct. 8.

	Starting Oct. 4, Concordia students and staff will need to be able to prove they have one dose of vaccine or a negative COVID-19 test, and two doses by Oct. 25. Those without two doses or an accepted exemption to the vaccine will not be allowed on campus after Oct. 25.

	Concordia's classes will continue to be held online until Oct. 4.

	NAIT students who wish to continue learning on campus will need to get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 24 in order to comply with the Restrictions Exemption Program when it takes effect there on Oct. 8. As per the school's own vaccine mandate, students will need to be able to prove full immunization on Oct. 25, and as of Nov. 8, rapid tests won't be accepted as an alternative.

	Both NAIT and Concordia have extended withdrawal deadlines to Sept. 24 and 21, respectively, for students who do not want to meet the schools' vaccine requirements.

	The decision comes after the province announced 199 new cases over the weekend. 63 cases on Saturday, a record high of 75 new cases on Sunday, and 61 on Monday. The total number of active cases across the province is 484.

	""This is the most we have recorded since the pandemic began 18 months ago,"" said Russell.

	Twenty-three people are now in hospital with the virus, with 14 in an intensive-care unit. Provincial Green Party leader David Coon says he believes some of the continued cases may have been avoided had the province re-implemented the mandate sooner.

	""It should have been done earlier, no question about it, but I'm glad that the government is bringing in masks in indoor public spaces again,"" Coon told CTV News from his constituency office via Zoom.

	Despite the return of the mask mandate, New Brunswick is still in the green phase, though Higgs says that could also change in the coming days.

	""We're anxious to work through the numbers and decide what next steps are required, but that could include any of the restrictions that we had in the past as we might move back there to ensure that we get under control.""

	When asked if he regretted the province's original decision to lift the state of emergency, and subsequently all restrictions, on July 30, Higgs said he stands by the decision.

	""I'd certainly do the same thing again. I think a lot of people benefited from the summer, period,"" said Higgs.

	David Coon, who has been vocal about disagreeing with the Premier's COVID-19 recovery plan, says vaccination numbers over the summer didn't add up to what was necessary for a safe reopening.

	""It was very clear that the rate of vaccinations had already slowed down before that decision had been made. You could see it was not occurring at the rate that was needed.""

	Higgs says the province has seen a spike in vaccination bookings since last week.

	""Between last Wednesday when we announced our new measures, and today at 11 am, more than 6,600 people have booked an appointment for their first or second dose of COVID-19 vaccine,"" said Higgs.

	As of Monday, the province is reporting 77.8 per cent of eligible New Brunswickers are fully vaccinated, and 86.5 per cent have received their first dose.

	According to Public Health, 152 of the 199 new cases, or 76 per cent are not fully vaccinated.

	“We are now seeing infections among fully vaccinated New Brunswickers. We were aware that we could have breakthrough cases in the population, but certainly the affect on our health care system is much, much lower in those who are fully vaccinated,” said Dr. Russell during Monday’s news update.

	MANDATORY MASKS IN EFFECT TUESDAY

	As of 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, masks will be mandatory in all indoor public spaces, including:

	
		public spaces where the public and employees interact, such as retail businesses, malls, service centres, places of worship, and restaurants and bars except while eating;
	
		organized indoor gatherings in public spaces, such as weddings and funerals;
	
		common areas like lobbies, elevators and hallways, and public shared spaces including those in private sector and government workspaces; and
	
		public transportation.


	Previously existing mask policies continue to apply in public schools and early childhood learning facilities.

	The province announced last week that also effective Tuesday at 11:59 p.m., people will be required to show proof of vaccination when accessing certain events, services and businesses, and anyone entering New Brunswick must preregister their travel.

	“The past few weeks have been difficult for all New Brunswickers as we have seen our case numbers and hospitalizations rise quickly,” said N.B. Premier Blaine Higgs during Monday’s news update. ""The return of these health and safety measures may feel like we are taking a step backwards, but we must look at our current situation and consider what will happen if we do nothing.""
