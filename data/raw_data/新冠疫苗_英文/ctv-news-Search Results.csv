Simcoe Muskoka prepares to receive child COVID-19 vaccine,"Nov. 22, 2021 9:30 p.m. CST","
     
     BARRIE, ONT. - 
     
    
	The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU) is preparing to receive COVID-19 vaccines for children aged five to 11 this week.

	On Friday, Health Canada announced that it had approved a modified version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children.

	According to SMDHU, it anticipates that the pediatric formulation of the COVID-19 vaccine will be received locally this week, and the health unit will make it available by appointment only through local community clinics, pharmacies and some primary care providers.

	SMDHU expects that appointments for children will become available on the provincial booking system this week.

	""Getting 5-to-11-year-olds vaccinated is safe and the most effective way to protect them from COVID-19. This is the next major step in our efforts, locally and beyond, to protect children and the broader community from the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Dr. Charles Gardner, SMDHU's Medical Officer of Health.

	Health Canada and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) say that preliminary evidence shows the vaccine is 91 per cent effective at preventing COVID-19 in children 5 to 11 years of age, and no serious side effects have been identified, said the statement released by SMDHU.

	The first batch of COVID-19 vaccines for children in Canada landed in Hamilton on Sunday.

"Asian shares mixed after China warning on risks, stagflation","Nov. 22, 2021 2:07 p.m. CST","
     
    
	Stocks were mixed in Asia on Monday after ending the week mostly lower on Wall Street, despite the Nasdaq's first close above 16,000.

	A resurgence of coronavirus outbreaks in the U.S., Europe and some other regions is weighing on investor sentiment. Comments by advisers to the Chinese central bank about risks of ""stagflation,"" meanwhile, have reinforced concerns about inflationary pressures.

	The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.7% to 3,583.37, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.4% to 24,962.11.

	Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% lower to 29,717.58. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 500 gave up 0.4% to 7,368.00.

	Shares fell in India but rose in Taiwan.

	Attention has turned to the People's Bank of China as Beijing strives to curb risks from excessive borrowing by property developers but still keep the economy growing.

	An adviser to the PBOC, Liu Shijin, told a conference over the weekend that China needed to avoid ""quasi-stagflation,"" Bloomberg reported.

	Another economist, Jia Kang, echoed that sentiment, saying that if the pace of economic growth is slower than the inflation rate, ""then how can we formulate a prescription for macro-control?""

	Ting Lu of Nomura noted that controls on property lending, fresh waves of COVID-19 outbreaks and strict policies to fight them and surging prices are all adding to China's policy challenges.

	""A raft of meeting memos and policy reports show that Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned about the growth slump and has begun to take action to shift its policy stance in order to prevent growth from sliding further,"" Ting said in a report.

	On Friday, the S&P 500 index gave up 0.1% to 4,697.96 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% to 35,601.98.

	The Nasdaq added 0.4% to 16,057.44, for its sixth straight gain.

	Smaller-company stocks fell more than the broader market. The Russell 2000 index lost 0.9% to 2,343.16.

	Despite an up-and-down week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched weekly gains, while the Dow posted its second straight weekly loss.

	Some 66% of companies in the S&P 500 fell, with financial and energy stocks accounting for a big share of the pullback. Those losses outweighed gains in technology and a mix of companies that rely on consumer spending.

	Energy related shares fell as U.S. crude oil prices dropped 3.7%.

	U.S. stocks have been mostly pushing higher since early October as companies reported much stronger profits for the summer than analysts expected, with overall earnings growth of about 40%. That's much better than forecasts for 23% growth made back in June.

	Still, companies are facing higher raw materials costs and supply chain problems that could crimp future profits. Consumers have so far absorbed higher prices, but analysts fear they could start economizing if higher prices persist too long.

	The situation is putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to move faster to rein in its ultra-low-rate policies in order to combat rising prices. On Friday, analysts at Bank of America projected that the Fed will likely start raising its benchmark interest rate in the second quarter of 2022, two quarters earlier than they had previously forecast.

	Investors are waiting to see if U.S. President Joe Biden decides to keep Jerome Powell at the Fed's helm.

	Biden is expected to announce within days whom he will choose for the nation's most powerful economic position. Many Fed watchers expect Powell to be offered a second term, though Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, has emerged as a leading alternative.

	In other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 3 cents to US$75.97 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the basis for international pricing, lost 5 cents to $78.84 per barrel.

	The U.S. dollar rose to 114.15 Japanese yen from 113.96 yen on Friday. The euro slipped to $1.1278 from $1.1289.

	Health Canada approved the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 on Friday, and the province said starting Monday at 6:00 a.m., parents can book appointments for their kids to get the shot.

	It's good news for Manitobans like Cara Windle, who plans to make an appointment to get her daughter Sophie on the path to being fully vaccinated.

	""We've been waiting a long time, (we're) really excited. We'll be setting our alarm for 5:55 a.m. to make sure we get her in as soon as we're able,"" she said.

	""I have type one diabetes,"" said Sophie. ""It'll definitely be reassuring to have the (vaccine).""

	The Windles aren't the only family planning to get everyone fully vaccinated. Dave Thomas will be booking an appointment for his 7-year-old son Emmett Monday morning as well.

	""Getting the kids back to a more normal school environment is my number one priority,"" said Thomas.

	""Getting our numbers down in Manitoba to the point where the rest of us can get back to normal is number two for me.""

	Manitoba's Vaccine Implementation Task Force said vaccines for kids ages 5 to 11 will be available at Pharmacies, Physician Clinics, Urban Indigenous Clinics, and Vaccine Clinics so kids can get their doses as easily as possible.

	On Thursday, Medical Lead Dr. Joss Reimer said the province has already been preparing the logistics for the vaccine rollout.

	""We want to be ready in Manitoba so that when the vaccine arrives here, we can start shipping it to locations and administering it to 5 to 11-year-olds as soon as it arrives in the province.""

	First appointments are expected to be available as early as next week.

	Thomas hopes one day his son can learn in an environment that's mask-free.

	""Can't wait,"" he said. ""If I could be first in line, I would be.""

	Cara said getting kids 5 to 11 vaccinated is important, not just for the kids but for everyone around them.

	""It's not just about you. It's about your kids. It's about parents. It's about older people. We all have a duty in society, I think, to protect the most vulnerable.""

Sask. looks to avoid 5th wave as holiday season approaches ,"Nov. 19, 2021 7:00 p.m. CST","
     
     Even as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations decline in the province, health officials say it’s not time to ease up on public health guidelines as they look to avoid a post-holiday season fifth wave.  November modelling numbers from the Saskatchewan Health Authority show how hospitalizations could look in one month.  Dr. Saqib Shahab, the province’s chief medical health officer said continued low mixing behaviour by the public and a slow immunization waning trajectory could result in sustainable numbers in the new year.

       Highs and lows of Sask. vaccination uptake detailed in latest modelling 95 new COVID-19 cases in Sask.; 4 more deaths   (Source: Government of Saskatchewan)  “We have to do everything to avoid scenario number one which is a fifth wave any time in January or February, and stay the course ideally letting our ICU and acute care centres come down really low by January,” he said.  COVID-19 admissions are trending downward in Saskatchewan hospitals. Daily admissions are down 29 per cent in the last two weeks and ICU admissions are down 41 per cent. Saskatchewan remains first among Canadian provinces in hospitalizations and ICU admissions per 100,000 people.  To maintain the downward trends, Shahab said restrictions will likely remain in place through the holiday season. Additional measures are not on the table at this time.  Last week Shahab recommended small gatherings over the holidays and said while it may feel odd, residents are advised to wear masks.  Saskatchewan's health minister says vaccine uptake will be the key to avoiding a fifth wave.  “I think we’re still in around 2,000 vaccines per day, first and second dose,” Paul Merriman said. “We need to increase that. It’s going to jump up when the Johnson & Johnson, and the children are eligible.”  Some of Saskatchewan’s rural communities reported lower than anticipated vaccination uptake, according to the latest COVID-19 modelling.

	Dix said the timeline for when the first shots will go into the arms of youth in B.C. will be unveiled on Tuesday.

	But for now, he's encouraging parents across the province, and ""everybody on Vancouver Island,"" to register their kids for it right away.

	Meanwhile, Ontario's chief provincial health officer, Dr. Kieran Moore, said Wednesday that his province will have vaccine's rolling out for youth later this month. He indicated that the two shots would likely be spaced out by eight weeks.

	Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease expert, says that an eight week interval between shots is thought to improve effectiveness and reduce the odds of any rare complications.

	""If you separate them by (roughly) two months you have a more robust immune response,"" said Bogoch.

	Many parents have been anxiously awaiting this news, as have teachers.

	""Certainly what I'm hearing from teachers is concern about travel over the winter break and what that might mean in January,"" said Winona Waldron, the president of the Greater Victoria Teachers Association.

	The province is also gearing up for a major campaign in the next week to educate and persuade families who are not convinced the shot is a good plan for their children.

	The Middlesex-London Health Unit (MLHU) says it will act “very quickly” to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to children between the ages of five and 11.

	Health Canada announced approval of the use of a pediatric version of the Pfizer vaccine Friday morning.

	For parents of children between five and 11 another big decision is coming -- to vaccinate or not vaccinate their kids against the COVID-19.

	Health officials say the option to vaccinate will be on the table as early as this month.

	MLHU Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Alex Summers says, “The timing of the arrival of the vaccine will dictate when we can start vaccinating kids under 12. But it will happen very quickly.”

	In London, mom Miriam is in a unique spot. Her five-year-old son will be eligible for the vaccine, but Eli, just like his sister and the rest of the family have already battled the illness.

	“We‘ve actually all had COVID, our whole family. They both tested positive and they had hardly any symptoms.”

	But Miriam, who did not want to give her last name, contends she and others faced a tougher fight with the virus even though no one in the family was hospitalized.

	Now, like so many others parents she is looking at vaccination for her kids.

	Once here, vaccines for kids will be distributed at MLHU mass vaccination clinics, along with some pharmacies and health-care centres.

	The availability of early appointments will depend on uptake.

	But Summers says his team has the ability to vaccinate everyone in the five to 11 age group – between 38,000 and 39,000 kids -- within a month.

	“We have the capacity to vaccinate 100 per cent, with one dose, all children in our region through pharmacies, primary care, and mass vax, within the first four weeks that things become eligible.”

	The question remains whether all parents will partake with their kids, but heath officials says if they do, the COVID-19 threat is reduced for everyone.

	Miriam says they haven't yet decided, “We’re still thinking about it. It’s just weighing the risks.”

	Word of children’s vaccines becoming available coincides with the fact the London region is now just a fraction away from 90 per cent of people having a single dose.

	“It makes it so we can’t see his grandmother in the senior’s complex and things,” he told CTV News.

	It’s unclear whether kids who are about to turn five will be able to get the shot similar to what was done with kids who were 11 and about to turn 12.

	Last month, the Government of Saskatchewan announced it ordered 112,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine formulated for children in the five to 11 age group. The shipment is expected to be sent once the vaccine is approved.

	“We’ll be ready as soon as those vaccines hit the ground, as soon as they’re distributed out from the federal government,” Health Minister Paul Merriman said.

	Education Minister Dustin Duncan said the province is looking at making vaccines available at schools or near them so that it is easily accessible.

	“With that age group, we’d want a parent to be present and so, looking at perhaps making it available after school hours so that a parent can be present which might be a little bit easier to accommodate for parents that would be working during the day,” he said.

	Saskatoon Public Schools and Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools are both supportive of the vaccine approval and say it will help keep students, staff and families safe.

	Both school divisions said they are working with the province on how to roll out the vaccines and are offering spaces within their facilities where the vaccine can be administered.

	As for addressing vaccine hesitancy in the younger age groups, Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab says education and scientific data are key.

	“It’s a lower dose vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine, 10 microgram. Adverse events are few and far between, what you would expect with any vaccine, local soreness, in a few cases, the aches and pains for a bit,” he said.

	Shahab said proof of vaccination is not required for kids 12 to 17 and also won’t be required for children five to 11.

Canadian health officials expected to approve Pfizer vaccines for children: report,"Nov. 19, 2021 10:11 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 could soon become a possibility in Canada, a move supported by Alberta, according to reporting by the Toronto Star.

	Sources told the publication that Health Canada officials would be making the announcement approving the Pfizer vaccine for those between ages five and 11 on Friday, and 2.9 million doses are expected to be delivered to Canada by the end of November.

	The U.S. is now administering shots to children as young as five after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted authorization in October.

	Alberta Health officials have made preparations for vaccine rollout by allowing parents and guardians to preregister their children on the online vaccine booking system, but specific timelines have not been unveiled.

	Other provinces – like Manitoba and Ontario – have already laid out comprehensive rollout plans for the age group.

	When asked about Alberta's strategy Thursday, Premier Jason Kenney wouldn't tip his hand.

	Experts say they hope it's an organized plan that can get shots in arms before the Christmas break.

	""These kids can still give the virus to their parents or at risk grandparents,"" infectious disease expert Dr. Craig Jenne told CTV News.

	""They're part of our social circles, and with the holidays coming up we are anticipating a lot more in the way of family gatherings. Likewise, we've seen over the course of the last year how many times classrooms have been disrupted. Things like vaccination is how we avoid that and how we keep outbreaks out of our schools.""

	Since the start of the school year, children between the ages of five and nine have made up the most COVID-19 cases per capita in Alberta.

	According to the province, there is slightly more than 390,000 children in Alberta between the ages of five and 11.

	As well, Alberta Health has no plans to include younger children in the Restrictions Exemption Program where proof of vaccination is required to participate in many activities.

	The province said it would encourage vaccines for younger children.

	""We know from listening to parents the importance of really for that five to 11 year old age group, underlining the fact that it is a parental choice for them to make,"" said Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw on Tuesday,

	""There is a societal benefit to having as many people as possible with vaccine protection, because that does minimize the chances that individuals in that age group would transmit to others.""

	As for vaccine requirements for school settings, the rules for staff and teachers will not be the same for students. Officials do not expect mandates for little ones.

	Education Minister Adriana LaGrange says all students are legally allowed to go to school regardless of their vaccination status.

	LaGrange wrote a letter encouraging school boards to require staff and any adults entering the school to have proof of vaccination or a negative test result.

	The Calgary Board of Education announced last month that it would require staff and volunteers to be vaccinated by Dec. 17.

	There are now 498 people in hospital with COVID-19, including 98 patients in intensive care units. It’s the first time since Aug. 29, that there are both fewer than 500 in hospital and 100 in ICU.

	A full three-quarters of all Albertans, 75 per cent, have had a least a first dose. And, 70.4 per cent of the entire population have had a second dose.

	Earlier Thursday, CTV  News confirmed the federal government is set to announce on Friday that Health Canada has approved the COVID-19 vaccine for children aged five to 11. 

	This resulting drop in eligibility age will also cause the per cent of eligible Albertans to have received a vaccine to drop significantly as well. 

	Other vaccines, including Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen, have not been approved for use in those under 12

	In a statement Thursday, Pfizer Canada said the company is prepared to deliver the pediatric doses to Canada shortly following the Health Canada authorization.

	Region of Waterloo Public Health says that COVID-19 vaccines have prevented thousands of cases, hundreds of severe cases, and dozens of deaths.

	The numbers and other updates were provided at a Wednesday night board of health meeting.

	As of Nov. 9, vaccines are estimated to have prevented 8,284 cases, 895 severe cases, and 157 deaths in Waterloo Region.

	Public health says there are 48,000 children between the ages of five and 11 who will be eligible.

	""By prioritizing these first doses to children, we hope to complete the first rush of children's vaccination in approximately two to two and a half, three weeks,"" said Vickie Murray of the vaccine distribution task force. ""Then we'll be able to continue to provide a variety of vaccination options that makes vaccines easily accessible for all Waterloo Region children.""

	Part of the plans include setting up after school and weekend vaccine clinics at local schools. Public health adds that they're currently in talks with the region's school board to finalize plans.

	Greater Sudbury said Wednesday that 96 per cent of its staff are fully vaccinated or have received at least one dose.

	That means 139 employees have refused the vaccine despite the mandatory vaccine policy, and the city said the majority of them are unpaid leave.

	""Under the policy released in September, all employees are required to be fully vaccinated with an accepted vaccine by Nov. 15, unless they have a valid Human Rights Code-based exemption for medical or religious reasons,"" the city said in a news release.  Northern Ontario COVID-19 coverage

	""As of end of day Nov. 15, more than 2,700 employees have provided their vaccination status, with nearly 94 per cent fully vaccinated. Of the remaining city employees, just over two per cent have received a single dose, three per cent are not vaccinated and one per cent have not declared their status. There is currently one approved exemption.""

	About 60 per cent of employees who are not vaccinated or did not declare their status are part-time/casual workers. That means there will be minimal service interruptions to the public, the city said.

	“As we continue to see a concerning rise in the number of COVID-19 cases locally, we remain committed to doing all we can to reduce transmission and ease the burden on our healthcare system,” Greater Sudbury Mayor Brian Bigger said in the release.

	“Being fully vaccinated continues to be the best protection against COVID-19 and the Delta variant, and I want to thank our employees for doing their part to protect the well-being of our community.”

	“We adopted this policy so that people can enter city facilities knowing that we are taking the proper steps to keep them safe and healthy,” said CAO Ed Archer said in the release.

	“We join many other public and private-sector organizations across the country in implementing this public health measure, and I am pleased to see the positive response from the vast majority of our employees.”

	The policy applies to all city employees, students, members of council and volunteers at city facilities or workplaces. The policy will also apply to members of council-appointed committees when these meetings move from virtual to in-person.

	Effective Nov. 15, the city has also expanded proof of vaccination requirements to include some additional municipal facilities. More details are available here.

How to talk to loved ones about vaccine status ahead of the holidays,"Nov. 17, 2021 4:45 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	With the holidays coming up in just a few weeks, many Manitobans are hoping to get together with their family and friends to celebrate.

	However, with current gatherings restrictions and people having various comfort levels around unvaccinated individuals, this could lead to some uncomfortable conversations.

	According to psychologist Dr. Syras Derksen, it is a tricky time.

	He said people will need to think about their boundaries and comfort levels.

	“It can be hard to balance our own feelings about these things, our own assessment of our own risk, against the feelings of others and how people are going to respond to us,” Derksen said.

	He said when approaching difficult conversations, research shows it is good to start by saying something positive, adding that it is useful to find a way to compliment the person in a way that is related to the topic at hand.

	“So if you were going to say something about somebody’s cooking, you might say, ‘You’re a great cook,’ and then you could go on to say your criticism about what they made for you that day,” he said.

	Derksen noted that when approaching the topic of vaccines, it’s good to add in sentiments that show the other person you still like them and aren’t trying to avoid them, such as “I really wish you could be there.”

	He said that you could also show you’re thinking about everyone’s well-being by saying, “I’m not just protecting my own risk, but I’m also protecting everybody’s risks.”

	NAVIGATING HURT FEELINGS

	Derksen said that during these conversations, there will be hurt feelings on both sides.

	He said it’s important that to recognize your feelings, so you don’t end up saying something you regret.

	“Sometimes we’re so focused on the other person’s feelings, we don’t realize that we’re actually being hurt by the fact that this person’s not going to be there or you feel, maybe frustrated, that the person didn’t get vaccinated,” he said.

	Derksen explained it’s also important to have conversations about vaccines and COVID-19 in advance, so people don’t get their hopes up about a holiday that may not end up happening.

	“If they’re picturing a certain kind of Christmas, a certain kind of holiday, and then, later on, you take that away from them by telling them your boundaries, that’s going to be a bigger loss than if they’re prepared and they can envision something a little more accurately,” he said.

	RECOGNIZE DIFFERENCES

	Derksen said it is important to recognize there will be differences of opinions when it comes to vaccines.

	“There are so many pieces of information that go into this,” he said.

	“Everybody’s risk and everybody’s vulnerability and everybody’s ideas around these things are so different.”

	He noted that it’s important to have a tolerance for people’s differences and be aware that others may not feel the same way as you.

	That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t be in a relationship, he said.

	“Communicating that and being aware of those differences is really important.”

	Derksen noted it’s generally ineffective to try to pressure people to do things your way.

	“Putting on heaps of pressure or negative criticisms or insults, those things don’t generally work in persuading people,” he said, noting that setting boundaries is already a persuasion.

	He noted it’s important not to mix telling people what you’re comfortable with and persuasion.

	“You don’t want to tell them, ‘This is what I’m comfortable with,’ and then say, ‘You should really be doing this.’ You want to leave that for another conversation,” Derksen said.

	After reporting a 99 per cent compliance rate on Tuesday, Kelly Paleczny said, “The health and safety of our employees and our riders has been a top priority throughout the pandemic.”

	London Transit has approximately 650 employees, with about 350 drivers. Staff were given until Nov. 12 to offer proof of full vaccination or to have requested an accommodation.

	According to Paleczny, 96 per cent of employees have provided proof of vaccination, the other three per cent have provided an approved request of accommodation or are off the job. As for those who did not comply with the policy, Paleczny says, “I can say it’s under 10 employees and that group of employees is currently off work and on unpaid leave.”

	The LTC General Manager says the commission is keeping the lines of communication open with those employees.

	“We direct them to information, to do their homework, see their doctor, have those consultations and make the choice that’s right for them. So, certainly we are continuing to work with that group of employees.”

	The commission has been dealing with a shortage of drivers due to resignations, many related to the pandemic, but Paleczny says the workers on leave aren’t further complicating that issue and she adds that vaccine requirements hasn’t been an issue with new hires.

	“It’s been a requirement for anybody we onboard and we’ve not seen any pushback from that as we continue to hire.”

RVH visitors must show proof of vaccination,"Nov. 16, 2021 3:40 a.m. CST","
     
     BARRIE, ONT. - 
     
    
	Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre (RVH) in Barrie now requires proof of vaccination for visitors.

	Visitors or those attending the hospital with a patient will have to prove that 14 days have passed since their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and show identification. If they are not vaccinated, visitors will have to provide documentation that they have a medical exemption. Visitors will also be required to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and go directly to and from the patient room.

	Suppose the visitor or essential caregiver does not have proof of vaccination or an exemption. In that case, the hospital will provide exceptions if the patient is a child, in palliative care, in labour, experiencing a life-altering illness or if the patient requires a support person due to an underlying condition.

	Currently, patients are allowed one visitor per day for one hour. Visits must be scheduled in advance by calling the inpatient unit before 6 a.m. More information can be found here.

New study shows 11 per cent of Sask. residents refusing COVID-19 vaccine ,"Nov. 16, 2021 2:49 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	A new study from researchers at the University of Saskatchewan is providing more insight into factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal among Saskatchewan residents. 

	The study, which included just over 9,000 participants in Saskatchewan, found 76 per cent were willing to or had been vaccinated against the virus; 13 per cent had not decided; and 11 per cent said they would not get vaccinated.

	According to the peer-reviewed article, a lower level of education, financial instability and indifference to spreading COVID-19 to others were all factors that contributed to vaccine refusal or skepticism.

	Those who said they were only “somewhat concerned” about spreading the virus were nearly three times more likely to reject vaccinations, while respondents who reported a “slight concern” were 7.4 times more likely to say no to the shot.

	Participants who identified as Indigenous were 2.4 times more likely to turn down the vaccine and 1.7 times more likely to be unsure of the jab. Women and newcomers were also more likely to be skeptical of the shot, while Saskatoon residents were less likely to outright refuse.

	Researchers said the belief COVID-19 is a threat to the community and believing one is at a high risk of death or illness because of the virus lowered the possibility of vaccine refusal and hesitancy.

	Respondents who thought COVID-19 is a “very/fairly big” threat were 86 per cent less likely to refuse vaccination and 57 per cent less likely to be wary of the shot compared to those who believed the threat was “very/fairly small.”

	Researchers said they hope the results of the study will provide some direction for targeted efforts to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake across the province.

B.C. family plans to cross U.S. border to get COVID-19 vaccine for 8-year-old child,"Nov. 14, 2021 10:38 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Health Canada could approve a COVID-19 vaccine for children aged five to 11 later this month, but for some families, that isn’t soon enough.

	Vancouver resident Geoff Berner is taking his eight-year-old daughter south of the border, where the Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine is available to kids under the age of 12. On Nov. 22, she’ll be vaccinated at a Walmart in Bellingham, Wash.

	“We’re getting the vaccine early because we don’t feel it’s safe for our kid to be in B.C.,” said Berner.

	He criticizes the provincial government for easing restrictions, despite the coronavirus still spreading and the death toll growing.

	“Every time they manage to get the numbers down, they just open more things,” he said. “They opened (Rogers Arena) and have 18,000 people drinking beer with no masks, then turn around and say, ‘Keep your Christmas gatherings as small as you can.’”

	At least one family doctor doesn’t see an issue with concerned parents getting their kids vaccinated stateside, as long as they’re aware of the implications.

	“It’s not as simple as getting in the car, crossing the border, getting your kid vaccinated, then coming home,” said Dr. Anna Wolak.

	Anyone who crosses into the United States will need to show proof of a negative PCR test upon returning to Canada. Each test could cost upwards of $100. Additionally, federal law requires children under 12 to stay home from school or day care for 14 days after their arrival.

	It’s not an issue for Berner, who’s homeschooling his child because of concerns around the spread of COVID-19 in schools.

	“If the government did more to protect children, like brought in proper ventilation in schools and did rapid testing and things that work in other places, we wouldn’t need to run across the border to get the vaccine,” he said.

	Last week, Canada’s chief medical advisor Dr. Supriya Sharma said Health Canada is actively continuing its review of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine for children, which was authorized for use in the U.S. earlier this month.

	The under-12 population, the only group ineligible for COVID-19 vaccines, continues to have the highest incidence rate of the virus nationwide.

	Wolak is hopeful that once the vaccine is approved, it will be made available immediately.

	“Parental anxiety is heightened at the moment. We need to get (vaccination for children under 12) addressed, so we know they are protected and parents can breathe a sigh of relief,” she said.

Winnipeg sport league's tightened COVID-19 protocols useful amid new restrictions  ,"Nov. 15, 2021 8:53 p.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	The province is trying to curb transmission in teen sports as COVID-19 cases surge among Manitoba’s youth, but some recreational sports leagues are far ahead of the coming restrictions.

	At a Saturday morning game for the U16 B St. James Boom ringette team, goalie Paige Follette is ready to play.

	Playing for nine years, Follette says the sport is vital for him in staying busy and healthy.

       Manitoba introduces new public health restrictions to reduce COVID-19 case numbers

	""It's pretty important because it plays a toll on mental health and it's one of the things makes me really happy, so it's really important,"" she said.

	The Winnipeg Ringette League, which the team is a part of, mandated all players had to be doubled vaccinated at the start of the season.

	A rule that might have had some backlash, but made many parents glad.

	""As a parent I'm happy,” said James Follette, Paige’s dad. “Both my parents are immunocompromised so I was vaccinated quite some time ago and so was my daughter as soon as she had the ability to.""

	The league said it implemented the rules to ensure it wouldn't have to change or add anything if the government made stricter restrictions.

	It is a move that's now paying off.

	MANITOBA'S NEW RULES AROUND VACCINATIONS FOR INDOOR YOUTH SPORTS

	On Friday, the province announced Manitobans aged 12 to 17 playing in indoor recreational sports will need to have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or show a negative test taken 72 hours before game time.

	The new rule takes effect on Dec. 6.

	Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, said the new rule was prompted by modelling which shows case counts are increasing most rapidly among youth between the ages of zero and 19.

	Epidemiologist Cynthia Carr, founder of EPI Research, told CTV News she understands the province's new vaccine requirement rule, but would like some more details.

	""It is a little bit confusing. It would be helpful to have some more data about what sort of led to that decision in terms of how do we know that group might have more challenges in vaccination rates versus just kids in general that are getting together in school,"" she said.

	""I think we need to understand more about, again, where the gaps are in young people being vaccinated, and what information and support parents need to make these decisions.""

	'IT WORKED': RINGETTE LEAGUE SAYS MANDATE HAD WORKED WELL

	As for Jennifer Kingsley, vice president of the Winnipeg Ringette League, she said the league's decision to require vaccines at the beginning of the season – months before the province would require them to be – has worked out well.

	""We are willing to stand there and say the health of everyone is more important than a little bit of problems for us to do it,"" Kingsley said. ""So we did that and it worked.""

	Nancy Tovell, the Boom's head coach, said the league's foresight is taking away the stress of scrambling to check vaccination status now.

	""I feel it was lifting me off a lot of other things as a coach. I didn't have to worry about vaccinated and unvaccinated girls mixing on my team and potentially transferring the virus,"" said Tovell.

	As for players like Follette, she said she would meet any restriction as long as it means staying on the ice.

	""They're pretty easy to follow. It's just like a little adjustment. If it means I get to keep playing ringette, then I'll definitely follow them.""

'We are full capacity and have only two beds available now'; STEGH facing 'dire situation',"Nov. 14, 2021 7:13 a.m. CST","

	CTV News had planned to speak to St. Thomas-Elgin General Hospital (STEGH) Chief of Staff Dr. Waleed Chehadi Saturday, regarding what he is calling a 'dire situation' in his hospital. However he is so busy dealing with patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) he couldn't leave his post.

	""It is very busy and patients are very acute and sick,"" says Dr. Chehadi who only had time to answer one question.

	""I am constantly thinking about the next patient that's going to come through and whether I'm going to be able to care for them.""

       MLHU reports 16 new COVID-19 cases, one death Saturday 

	STEGH President and CEO Karen Davies took Dr. Chehadi's place for the interview.

	""We're at full capacity and there's only two hospital beds available right now,"" says Davies.

	""We added 22 extra beds to this hospital many months ago because of the pandemic and the increase in the occupancy. Having 13 extra COVID patients makes a big difference because those patients are really resource intensive.""

	Davies says 13 patients doesn't seem like much, but it's pushed their ICU to the limit.

	""Our ICU capacity, which is level three (the highest level) is at capacity, and because of that we've had to send to COVID patients requiring a level of care to London in the last 18 hours.""

	Hospital officials say the number of cases in Elgin County is rising at an unprecedented rate with more than 150 active positive cases in Southwestern Public Health (SWPH).

	Patients needing critical care are at the highest it has been since the start of the pandemic.

	SWPH has seen double digit positive cases daily recently, and a few COVID-19 related deaths.

	Eighty-four per cent of the region is double-vaccinated, but the unvaccinated are driving the hospital cases. That includes the N5H postal code in Aylmer, Ont. and Malahide Township.

	""We do serve as a community that has a high rate of not being vaccinated, and all 13 COVID patients in hospital are unvaccinated,"" says Davies.

	""So they are coming into our emergency department. Our message to them is first and foremost, please get vaccinated, wear a mask and be kind. If you can't get vaccinated, you choose not to get vaccinated and you're sick with COVID like symptoms, please don't wait to seek care. We're seeing people that are staying home until they're very sick and critically ill and then coming to the emergency department. It's easier and better outcomes for them if they come and seek care earlier.""

	Earlier this week Medical officer of health Dr. Joyce Lock said it's very important that everyone in the region has access to a hospital bed if necessary.

	""I think there is an onus on us to perhaps take more stringent measures and we are re-evaluating capacity limits,"" says Lock.

	""We're going to be looking very carefully at the data to determine whether that would help prevent the spread and free up some more space within our health care institutions.""

	Lock says if you haven't been vaccinated, now is the time to help relieve stress on STEGH.

	""If you had a vaccine and you do happen to get the infection it will be much more mild,"" says Lock.

	""You have about a 30 to 35 per cent less chance being up in the ICU and you have about a 20 per cent less chance of ending up in the hospital. We have seen deaths in our community recently with people who had COVID so it is a reality out there. That it's still a very serious illness much, much more serious for those who are unvaccinated.""

	Davies is worried going forward that as people start moving indoors this trend could continue.

	""Our accountability is to make sure that we're available to care for the residents of St. Thomas and Elgin County,"" says Davies.

	""People need our Emergency Department as they have accidents, heart attacks, they fall off ladders putting Christmas tree lights up, and we still need to be here for them. My concern right now is our ICU is at full capacity. And should somebody need level three ICU care, we'll have to send them outside of our hospital.""

A total of 22 residents and four staff members at the home have now tested positive. Public Health says they are working with the facility to prevent further spread, and have implemented increased public health measures and restrictions.

	CRACKDOWN IS COMING

	With 21 of the cases in the northern and western zones, where health officials say community spread is occurring, enforcement is being stepped up.

	On Nov. 5, the operators of the Woods Harbour Community Centre were given a fine of more than $11,600.

	""We received a complaint from the community about events being held in contravention of public health restrictions,"" said Cpl. Chris Marshall of the Nova Scotia RCMP.

	Marshall says officers visited the centre on Oct. 21 and Oct. 24, offering education on what COVID-19 protocols are in place.

	""In speaking to them, that's when we learned that they had been advised by the community centre management that there was no need for them to follow health restrictions,"" Marshall said.

	Wayne Malone is the community centre's president.

	""Everyone knows that COVID protocols need to be followed,"" he said. ""We have it listed on our door, we have our signage, everything is there.""

	He says the board will appeal the fine in court.

	""We're all family oriented, we get birthday parties, baby showers. We're an adult learning center,"" Malone said. ""I'm looking into getting a mental wellness centre going because it's huge or this past two years.""

	In a statement, Public Health says the fourth wave of COVID-19 is still washing over the province, and enforcement of protocols will continue.

	Any compliance action takes into consideration the risk to public health and the willingness of the business or organization to comply with this protocol.

	Malone says if the fine is upheld, the centre will close.

	EXPOSURE NOTICE FOR SEVEN SCHOOLS

	Health officials also sent exposure notices for seven schools in the province on Wednesday and Thursday.

	The latest school exposures are at Hants East Rural High School in Milford, Millwood High School in Middle Sackville, Basinview Community School and Rocky Lake Junior High in Bedford, Cunard Junior High, and Burton Ettinger Elementary and Fairview Junior High in Halifax.

	“It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious,” said N.S. Health in a release.

	A list of schools with exposures is available online.

	COVID-19 CASE DATA

	Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 3,451 on Wednesday and 2,552 tests on Thursday. A total of 1,347,985 COVID-19 tests have been processed since the start of the pandemic.

	There were 28,019 rapid tests administered between November 5 and 11. This includes 2,114 rapid tests at the pop-up sites in Halifax, Dartmouth, Amherst and Annapolis Royal and 25,905 through the workplace screening program. Another 11,558 home rapid tests were distributed at the pop-up sites.

		3 (8.3 per cent) were partially vaccinated
	
		28 (77.8 per cent) were unvaccinated


	VACCINE UPDATE

	The province's COVID-19 online dashboard provides an update on the number of vaccines that have been administered to date.

	As of Friday, 1,593,242 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 772,138 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 6,642 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

	In total, 83.4 per cent of the province's overall population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 78.9 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their second dose.

	The province says it has received a total of 1,661,340 doses of COVID-19 vaccine since Dec. 15, 2020.

These are the B.C. regions that had the most COVID-19 cases last week,"Nov. 13, 2021 5:43 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	With British Columbia averaging about 500 new cases of COVID-19 per day and 3,500 per week, the latest data from the province's COVID-19 Surveillance Dashboard shows which parts of B.C. are seeing the most coronavirus transmission. 

	The local health area that saw the largest number of cases from Nov. 2 through 8 was Abbotsford, which added 267 new infections during the period.

	The local health area that makes up most of the City of Surrey had the week's second-highest caseload, recording 227.

	The Central Okanagan region had the highest total for the week in Interior Health, at 191, while Nanaimo - at 137 - recorded the highest total on Vancouver Island.

	In Northern Health, the Prince George local health area saw 119 new cases, and Vancouver City Centre led the way for Vancouver Coastal Health with 63.

	Those numbers only tell part of the story, however. Looking at the rate of new infections per 100,000 residents offers a different perspective on how much coronavirus transmission is happening in a region.

	By this metric, Abbotsford retains the highest caseload in Fraser Health, but falls significantly behind other regions of the province for per-capita cases.

	Abbotsford recorded 23 cases per 100,000 residents from Nov. 2 through 8, and Surrey, with its large population, recorded just six.

	The highest per-capita case rate in the province during the week in question was found in the sparsely populated Vancouver Island West local health area, which saw 68 cases per 100,000 residents.

	In Northern Health, the Nisga'a region had the highest per-capita caseload, at 52 per 100,000. Several other local health areas were close behind, however, with Terrace recording 50 cases per 100,000, Quesnel recording 49 and Snow Country/Stikine/Telegraph Creek recording 48.

	The highest case rate in Interior Health was 38 per 100,000 in Cariboo/Chilcotin, and in Vancouver Coastal Health the highest rate was 26 per 100,000 in the Central Coast local health area.

	Notably, despite their high rates of COVID-19 transmission, many of these local health areas are trending in the right direction.

	Both Abbotsford and Surrey saw their per-capita case rates decline slightly last week, compared to the week before, and the rate in the Nisga'a local health area dropped dramatically, from 178 during the previous week.

	Vancouver Island West's rate for the week was down from 108 cases per 100,000 the week before, and Central Coast's declined from 78.

	Cariboo/Chilcotin saw its rate rise slightly, from 34 during the previous week, and several regions in Northern Health - including the aforementioned Terrace, Quesnel and Snow Country/Stikine/Telegraph Creek local health areas - saw increases in the per-capita case rates.

	The local health area with the largest increase in per-capita cases from week to week was Vancouver Island North, which went from just five cases per 100,000 residents during the week of Oct. 26 to Nov. 1 to 44 cases per 100,000 during the week of Nov. 2 to 8.

	Most of the people testing positive in B.C. are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The unvaccinated made up 58.2 per cent of new cases in the province between Nov. 1 and 7, despite accounting for less than 20 per cent of the total population of the province, including children under age 12, who are not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. 

	According to the surveillance dashboard, the province saw 139.5 cases per 10,000 residents among unvaccinated people between Oct. 12 and Nov. 8, compared to 34.9 cases per 10,000 among those with one dose of vaccine and 14.2 per 10,000 among those with both doses.

Alberta premier dismisses Opposition bid to censure him over handling of COVID-19,"Nov. 11, 2021 7:46 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	Alberta Premier Jason Kenney is dismissing an Opposition bid to have him formally censured in the legislature for his handling of COVID-19's fourth wave.

	Kenney says he is focused on getting Alberta's economy moving again and doesn't have time for what he calls cynical political gamesmanship.

	The Opposition NDP has been pushing for answers on why Kenney's government failed to act in August when case numbers were rising alarmingly, which led to intense pressure on hospitals the following month and 15,000 cancelled surgeries.

	Justice critic Irfan Sabir, suggesting Kenney must be held accountable for decisions that led to a great deal of suffering, says his party will introduce the censure motion when the house resumes sitting on Monday.

	Kenney has faced criticism from members of his own United Conservative caucus on his handling of COVID-19, and Sabir says a censure vote would be a chance for them to stand up for their constituents.

	Kenney notes that the pandemic's fourth wave has receded since public health rules and incentives were put in place in September, but says more work needs to be done.

	“We're glad to see that the fourth wave is clearly come under control and that the numbers have come down sharply since our government took measures - and thanks to Albertans stepping up to the plate,” Kenney said Wednesday at a news conference in Grande Prairie, Alta.

	“Our eye is on the ball, focused on protecting lives and livelihoods through whatever is left of COVID.

	“(This is) more political games from the NDP that sadly has treated COVID-19 not as an opportunity to come together, but rather for division. They have sought to politicize COVID-19 in Alberta from Day 1.”

	Sabir said the motion will read: “Be it resolved that the Legislative Assembly censure the premier for his failed leadership leading up to and through the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

	Alberta was forced to more than double the number of intensive care beds and call in military medical help during the height of the latest wave.

	Kenney has said he didn't act in August because he did not receive any recommendations from Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health.

	He has also said he wasn't sure strict health measures would have worked given Alberta's COVID-weary population.

	He has rejected an NDP call for an all-party inquiry into the fourth wave. He has said there will be time after the health crisis has passed to review what went right and wrong.

	On Tuesday, Hinshaw said the number of new cases has dropped significantly, but pressure on health care remains concerning.

	There were more than 6,000 active cases and 582 people in hospital Wednesday with the illness. Of those, 123 people were in intensive care.

	A total of 3,164 Albertans have died from COVID-19.

	The provincial measures introduced in September included a $100 incentive to get vaccinated and a form of vaccine passport to get into non-essential services.

	Alberta's passport, called a restrictions exemption, is voluntary, but businesses that don't sign up must comply with other rules, including severely restricted customer capacity.

	The province has developed a QR code as proof of vaccination, Albertans must download and show that code starting Monday if they want to visit restaurants, bars, movie theatres, casinos, concert halls and sporting venues.

	Alberta's fourth wave woes were tied to low vaccination rates compared with other jurisdictions in Canada. That rate has since climbed significantly. For those eligible, 12 and over, the inoculation rate sits at almost 88 per cent for a first dose and 81 per cent for full vaccination.

	This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 10, 2021.

     ""Get your vaccine, and stop spreading COVID!""  Those are the words of Aylmer BIA Chair Kevin Cross, fearing potential lockdowns by Southwestern Public Health (SWPH).  A combination of rising COVID-19 cases and low vaccination rates in the Aylmer area, as well as limited hospital capacity in St. Thomas has SWPH evaluating all options.

The N5H postal code, which includes the town of Aylmer, has the lowest vaccine uptake rate in the province.  ""It's something that we're not proud of in Aylmer and Malahide (Township) and right from the get-go there has always been resistance to the vaccine,"" says Malahide Township Mayor Dave Mennill.  The town of 7,500 people has been in the national spotlight since the beginning of the pandemic.  Aylmer has low vaccination rates and high COVID-19 case counts (27 ongoing). With a crude rate of 360 cases per 100,000 population -- SWPH has the second highest COVID-19 rates in Ontario.  Eighty-four per cent of people in SWPH have two doses, but it is the 16 per cent that are driving the case count.  Of the total positive COVID-19 cases in SWPH, approximately 78 per cent of them are unvaccinated.  Public Health Sudbury has recently rolled back to Step 3 restrictions after daily case counts surpassed 100.    SWPH could potentially do the same if the spread isn't curbed.  ""I think what's most important to all of us is to be sure that there is a hospital bed there for us when we need it, for whatever cause,"" says Lock.  ""St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital is running at a capacity rate of 130 per cent or more at the moment. They have about 12 patients with COVID in the hospital. So I think there is an onus on us to perhaps take more stringent measures and we are re-evaluating capacity limits. So we're going to be looking very carefully at the data to determine whether that would help prevent the spread and free up some more space within our health care institutions.""  Potential restrictions are concerning for Cross as both an Aylmer, Ont. resident and business owner.  ""It's a fear of lockdown, especially for us going into the Christmas season, because it's the biggest time where you know we can hopefully recover some of the losses from the lockdowns in the past,"" says Cross, who owns Durkee's on Talbot Street.

""My hope is by Christmas time we'll be back up to where the rest of the provinces is in that over 90 per cent (vaccine rate),"" says Mennill.  ""There is so many kinds of religious groups and people that aren't vaccinated, which is so unfortunate because they're not looking at the science that says that most of these people that are in the hospital right now are unvaccinated. That should be proof that the vaccine does work.""

	The County of Wellington issued a pandemic goal to end its state of emergency at midnight on Dec. 31, 2021.

	According to a press release, in order for this to happen two criteria have been set out: continued decline in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, and start of COVID-19 vaccination for children aged five to 11.

	The decision was made in consultation with the medical officer of Health for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.

	“After nearly 20 months of a global pandemic, it is time to chart a path back to something more normal for all of us,” said Dr. Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health and CEO for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health. “Ending the pandemic is a job for all of us. Please continue to follow public health guidance so that as we approach the time to ease restrictions, we are as safe and as ready as we can be.""

	The state of emergency in Wellington County was declared on March 23, 2020 in response to the pandemic.

	It allows Warden Kelly Linton to issue orders to protect the health, safety, property and welfare of residents.

	It also has allowed the county to rapidly redeploy staff to assist at the Wellington Terrace Long Term Care Home and in COVID-19 vaccination clinics

	“I have spoken with City of Guelph Mayor Cam Guthrie and Dufferin County Warden Darren White, and we are all on the same page,” Linton said in the release. “While there is no longer a need for a local state of emergency to be in place, the pandemic is not over. I continue to urge all residents to get vaccinated and continue to follow guidance from Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.”

	Officials noted nearly 80 per cent of eligible Wellington County residents have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

	Other groups are in the queue.

	""Towards the end of the month we will be able to open, to deliver third dose vaccinations to priority groups,"" said Nova Scotia’s Health Minister Michelle Thompson.

	She says that distribution will look similar to the province's original age-based vaccination plan.

	""People 80 years and older will be immunized first and then we will move to the 70 to 79 group and we will continue from there,"" Thompson said.

	""Also frontline health-care workers who have a vaccination with less than 28 days between their initial two doses.""

	Nova Scotians who received two shots of AstraZeneca or one dose of the Janssen vaccine will also be on the priority list.

	Cumberland North MLA Elizabeth Smith-McCrossin isn't happy with the speed of the roll-out.

	""We need to get our third shot, our booster into arms now (especially) our most vulnerable. That needs to be made a priority,"" Smith-McCrossin said.

	Those wishing to travel are also eagerly awaiting their booster with the hope that another shot of Pfizer will make international travel more accessible.

	Industry experts caution however that protocols can still change without much notice.

	""It's really important to check with those destinations, monitor what the requirements are currently with a trusted travel advisor to help you negotiate and plan ahead for what you might find when you get there,"" said Steve Olmstead, CAA’s public affairs director.

	There is also growing concern over an outbreak at East Cumberland Lodge, a long-term care home in nearby Pugwash, N.S.

	There is community spread, says public health, as a result of a faith gathering in the area last month, although it won't confirm where.

	""It was a multi-day gathering and there was approximately 100 people that attended the gathering,"" Dr. Shelley Deeks, Nova Scotia's deputy chief medical officer said on Monday.

	One Amherst church did hold such an event in late October.

	The pastor for Gospel Light Baptist Church would not speak to CTV News on camera, but Pastor Robert Smith calls what happened ""unfortunate"" and told CTV the event followed the rules for faith gatherings, which do not require proof of vaccination.

	He says parishioners did what 811 told them to when they learned of an exposure.

	""On Friday, Dr. Strang did reach out to faith-based leaders to clarify when proof of vaccine requirements are needed,"" Deeks said.

	Smith says 70 per cent of parishoners at the church are fully vaccinated, and the church is working with Nova Scotia Public Health.

	""I made some comments that people might have felt were misleading. And to anybody who felt misled by those comments, I take full responsibility for those comments,"" Rodgers said Tuesday.

	""I understand that this issue, in general, is very charging to a lot of people because we are talking about public health. I totally respect that,"" Rodgers said. ""I made a decision that was in the best interest based on consulting with my doctors. And I understand that not everybody is going to understand that necessarily. But I respect everybody's opinion.""

	Rodgers told McAfee he is feeling ""really good"" after testing positive for COVID-19 last week.

	Rodgers missed last Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs due to COVID-19 protocols. The Chiefs defeated the Packers 13-7.

	During an interview on McAfee's show Friday, Rodgers confirmed he is unvaccinated against COVID-19 and is disappointed with the treatment he's been receiving in the media.

	Rodgers said the media was on a ""witch hunt"" to find out which players were vaccinated and blamed reporters for him saying he was ""immunized"" back in August. Rodgers said if any reporter would have asked a follow-up question, he would have explained he's ""not an anti-vax flat earther,"" but that he's a ""critical thinker.""

	Rogers added last week that he has been following the strict NFL protocols for unvaccinated players to a ""T."" Rodgers described the testing he is subjected to every day, even on off days, and believes the rules are in place to shame unvaccinated people. Rodgers said he was tested over 300 times before testing positive this week.

	He did not get vaccinated because he has an allergy to an ingredient in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and was scared about the possible side effects from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, he said. The decision to seek alternative treatments was ""what was best for my body,"" he said.

	Rodgers is expected to play this Sunday at home versus the Seattle Seahawks.

"'This hasn't been an easy choice': Unvaccinated hospital worker explains her decision, braces for termination","Nov. 10, 2021 6:48 a.m. CST","
     
     Kitchener - 
     
    
	Krista Ruddy says she has enjoyed working as a medical lab assistant at Grand River Hospital for the past two years.

	But a month ago, the 39-year-old New Hamburg woman was placed on unpaid leave because she has chosen not to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

	“They gave me options that I was completely compliant with. I did my education training, I did my testing twice weekly that they asked me to,” said Ruddy. “I complied with everything they asked me to.”

	In September, Waterloo Wellington hospitals issued a mandate, requiring all staff to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 12 or be placed on unpaid leave.

	The new mandate was a joint initiative between Cambridge Memorial Hospital, Grand River Hospital, Groves Memorial Community Hospital, Guelph General Hospital, Homewood Health Centre, North Wellington Health Care Alliance and St. Mary’s General Hospital.

	Those who were unvaccinated had until Nov. 9 to comply with the mandate, or face disciplinary measures, including termination.

	Ruddy says she has a meeting scheduled with hospital management on November 18.

	“We got sent a letter stating that our job is in review. Here’s your date. Here’s your time. And that’s basically all we know,” said Ruddy.

	Ruddy said her decision not to get the COVID-19 vaccine was a personal one.

	“It’s still in trial. Like it’s in clinical trials. I’m too afraid to get something put into my body that I can’t get changed,” she explained.

	The Pfizer vaccine is one of the approved vaccines by Health Canada. In a press release issued a year ago, the pharmaceutical company concluded phase three of its study. According the company’s research, two doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has a 95 per cent efficacy rate in fighting the deadly virus.

	The Moderna vaccine is another one approved by Health Canada. On Health Canada’s website it says clinical trials showed that 2 doses of the Moderna vaccine is 94.1 per cent effective in protecting those aged 18 and above against COVID-19. And 100 per cent effective for those 12 to 17 years-old.

	Health Canada also tracks reported side effects and says that about 4 people out of every 10,000 people vaccinated have reported one or more adverse side effect in Canada. The current tally is 22,231 Canadians. Of that, 16,578 are considered non-serious. While 5,663 are considered serious. 539 people to-date have experienced a serious adverse event that include a severe allergic reaction.

	Despite that, Ruddy remains steadfast in her views about the COVID-19 vaccine.

	“This hasn’t been an easy choice for me at all. I’m terrified. But I’m also terrified of the reactions that you could get from this vaccine.”

	The single mom of two says she loves her job very much, and is now preparing for the fact that she may not have it for much longer.

	“This is serious for all the people that are off right now.”

	“I have nothing against anyone who chose what they chose,” she said. “I chose to not get vaccinated and that was my choice. And I shouldn’t be scrutinized and I shouldn’t lose my livelihood and my job because of what I chose for myself and neither should anybody else.”

	In a news release announcing the mandate on Sept. 1, the president and chief executive officer of Grand River Hospital said the move was meant to help keep the community safe.

	“The COVID-19 vaccine is a vital measure of protection, particularly as more services continue to open up, and community spread continues to increase,” said Ron Gagnon. “As a health care organization, we have a responsibility to safeguard and protect the health and wellness of those we work with, and those we care for.”

	The president of St. Mary’s General Hospital and the hospital lead for the COVID response echoed that in the same release, and said protecting the health and safety of patients and staff was the priority.

	“Vaccines are an important tool in the COVID fight and in our response to the highly transmissible Delta variant—something that we have witnessed the impact of first-hand,” said Lee Fairclough. “It is our responsibility to implement every safety measure possible to protect our patients and teams.”

Unvaccinated health-care workers to get priority for Johnson & Johnson vaccines arriving in B.C. next week,"Nov. 10, 2021 11:01 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Health-care workers will be given first priority for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which B.C. health officials say is expected to arrive by next week.

	In a COVID-19 briefing on Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the supply of the J&J vaccines will be limited.

	“It will be available first for any health-care worker who wants to use this as their way of getting back to work.”  B.C. adds 497 cases as Canada approves 1st COVID-19 vaccine for kidsFull coverage at CTVNews.ca/CoronavirusIs B.C. flooding affecting the province's COVID-19 numbers?

	B.C.’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health-care workers means that anyone who isn’t fully vaccinated against the virus is currently on unpaid leave. But, Henry says there are health-care workers who are still unvaccinated but have been waiting for the J&J vaccine to get immunized.

	“Some health care workers have said that this is the only option they will consider right now,” Henry said. “Our first priority will be offering it to health-care workers.”

	WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THE J&J VACCINE

	The J&J vaccine is considered a more traditional vaccine as it uses virus-based technology, as opposed to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which use mRNA.

	While the first couple of weeks administering the J&J vaccine will prioritize those in health care, Henry says there will be some available for others later on.

	“There have been a lot of people who've reached out to me asking for the J&J vaccine,” she said. “We will have some available and we will be providing you with the details next week of how you can access this through a central call-in number.”

	Among health-care workers, 97 per cent have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and are considered fully vaccinated, according to Dix.

	Two per cent haven't had any shots, and the remaining one per cent have just the first dose.

	The incoming J&J vaccine is different from other vaccines currently available in B.C. because a person is considered fully vaccinated after just one dose.

	“It's been widely used in the U.S. as a single dose vaccine. And it has good, strong protection … the same as the two doses of AstraZeneca,” Henry said.

	Henry said the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has recently received approval from the U.S. CDC for the vaccine to be given as a booster shot six months after a person receives their primary dose. But, she noted, the company has not yet applied for approval of boosters in Canada. 

	HEALTH CANADA UPDATES SIDE EFFECTS

	Common side effects from the J&J vaccine are temporary and can last a few hours to a few days, according to Health Canada’s web page on the vaccine. 

	“This is the body's natural response, as it's working hard to build protection against the disease,” reads the Health Canada website.

	These side effects may include redness, soreness, swelling, chills, fatigue, joint pain, headache, muscle aches or a mild fever.

	On Nov. 9, Health Canada said it’s updating the labels on the J&J vaccines (also known as the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine) to include warnings of very rare side effects.

	The move provides “additional information about the very rare risk of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune condition, and the rare risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following vaccination,” reads a statement from the national health agency.

	As the vaccine is still new in Canada, the agency is also providing information on what kind of side effects to watch out for. Health Canada says to seek medical attention if, after receiving the J&J vaccine, you have unexplained bleeding or bruising, small purplish spots beyond the site of vaccination, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain or swelling, or persistent abdominal pain.

	Other rare side effects, for which people should also seek prompt medical attention, include swelling of the lips and mouth, itchy hives, sudden low blood pressure, vomiting and diarrhea or loss of consciousness.

	But, Health Canada urges that people not be deterred, because the vaccine is approved for use in Canada and is overall safe and effective against the coronavirus.

	“Our decisions are based only on scientific and medical evidence showing that vaccines are safe and effective. The benefits must also outweigh any risks,” reads the website.

"University of Sask. student’s religion won’t allow for COVID-19 vaccine, leads to eviction from campus residence","Nov. 10, 2021 7:48 a.m. CST","
     
     SASKATOON - 
     
    
	Third-year University of Saskatchewan student Jimmy Ding, originally from China, has lived in Canada since 2014, and has been staying at St. Andrew’s College while pursuing a degree in geological engineering.

	He said his religion, which he prefers not to disclose, doesn’t allow him to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and this has resulted in him being evicted from his campus residence. 

	""I just practice what my religion script tells me to do,"" Ding said, adding he’s providing proof of negative tests to the college. “Because my vaccination status, and they try to evict me. I feel it’s not very appropriate.""

	""When the pandemic just started, and there were a lot of people they had some confusion that 'Oh, Chinese people they have a virus and they are dangerous,' it's not true.""

	Principal of St. Andrew’s College Richard Manley-Tannis said the living space at the college is communal with a shared kitchen and shared bathrooms, and because of the building’s age, it has no ventilation system.

	""It became clear that a significant amount of the current residents were not comfortable with having somebody unvaccinated, even with rapid testing in place, and owing to the context of the building,"" he said.

	Ding claims other residents at the college were only told that he wouldn’t receive the vaccine, and not the reason why he wouldn’t.

	""This is distorted information, to try to justify their discrimination,"" he said.

	Manley-Tannis explained it was not an easy decision to make, but it was about the safety of others and not a person’s race or religion. Ultimately, he said there wasn’t the physical space available to quarantine someone should they test positive for COVID-19.

	""In this COVID-world, the community's safety takes precedent,"" he said. ""It's very clear that educational institutions are exempt from eviction expectations, and likely for reasons exactly like that—because of the nature of our communal living context. We can't accommodate the way that we would like to.""

	""And let's be very clear, if St. Andrew’s had the physical capacity to offer this resident a space that honoured his request for religious accommodation, we would provide that.""

	Manley-Tannis said Ding must be out of the college before Nov. 19.

	Human rights commission response

	Ding said he’s been in contact with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission (SHRC) about his eviction. 

	""It says duty for the service provider to provide the accommodation for people who cannot give a proof of vaccine,"" he said. ""In order to balance this consideration and the safety issue, the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission said negative COVID tests could be (an) alternative to solve this issue and balance both sides.""

	""I have the freedom of practice, of religious practice.""

	In a statement to CTV News, SHRC said some people may not be able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine due to a reason protected by the code.

	""However, these cases are rare and must be supported by evidence. Objection to vaccination based on personal preference is not protected by the code,"" SHRC said. 

	""Employers and service providers have a duty to reasonably accommodate individuals who cannot receive the vaccine due to a reason protected by the code, to the point of undue hardship.

	Accommodation does not have to be perfect nor does it have to be the individual’s preferred accommodation, but it must be reasonable. Reasonable accommodation will differ on a case-by-case basis,” SHRC said. 

	Finding another place to live

	Ding said the eviction letter on his record makes it harder for him to find a new place to live, and the process has been stressful as the weather gets colder.

	""I probably will live on the street, or I talk to my friend or if they could give me a place,"" Ding said. ""I have no clue, I really have no clue.""

	""I just wish people could be nice to a refugee.""

	Manley-Tannis said St. Andrew's College and the U of S have shared resources for alternative accommodations with Ding.

	""I am well aware that there is actually space or alternative space within the city,"" Manley-Tannis said.

	""I also understand that the University of Saskatchewan has reached out or is intending to reach out to explore on campus facilities that have that quarantine capacity or a room that has its own bathroom and a room that has its own kitchen, which the college does not and is not able to provide.""

	In a statement from Jay Wilson, interim vice-provost teaching, learning, and student experience with the university, said he would not provide specifics on individual situations for privacy reasons, but said ""students living in any USask residences are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with having received two doses of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine a minimum of 14 days prior to moving in.""

	Uof S vaccination policy

	The university’s current COVID-19 policy requires anyone who’s accessing the campus to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test, and it will be changing to proof of double vaccination as the only way to access campus starting Jan. 4, 2022.

	Wilson said the university ""will continue to consider accommodation requests for these individuals in accordance with the requirements of the code. Only those with an approved accommodation, as appropriate and in limited circumstance, will be allowed on campus without being fully vaccinated.""

	Ding said he’s spoken with U of S president Peter Stoicheff, and under grounds protected by the Human Rights Code, will continue to provide negative COVID-19 test results to attend classes at the university in person passed Jan. 4.

	Manley-Tannis said St. Andrew’s College is an affiliated college and is completely autonomous, so it can operate under different guidelines, and providing a negative test isn’t enough to continue to live there.

	""If anything has become clear, it’s that rapid testing actually isn't 100% (effective). Rapid testing is a moment in time that doesn't actually tell you whether or not, as I understand the science, whether or not you're able to spread it at that stage,"" he said.

	""It's whether you're asymptomatic or symptomatic. And so rapid testing is helpful, but in a communal nature by the time that rapid test ends up displaying that you are positive you could have already been basically a carrier, and though asymptomatic, spreading the virus in a communal nature.""

	Ding argues since everyone else in the living space has been vaccinated they should be protected from infection, and encourages doctors and physicians to investigate other forms of immunity.

	""There are certain groups of people, they practice their religion, they’re doing meditation to improve their immune system,"" he said. ""Some people, based on their worldview have their method, some people they will take other methods.""

'Extorting and intimidating': Victoria business targeted after comparing anti-vaxxers to drunk drivers,"Nov. 10, 2021 5:56 a.m. CST","

	A Victoria business owner says his company has come under a ""sustained and coordinated attack"" by people opposed to COVID-19 vaccine mandates after the business barred anti-vaxxers from its premises, comparing them to drunk drivers.

	The owner of Victoria Escape Games says a ""vigilante mob"" has been targeting the business with negative online reviews in the wake of the management's request that those opposed to vaccines avoid the business.

	Victoria Escape Games says children under 12 and those with a medical exemption from being vaccinated are welcome at the business.

	""For those who have followed the science and been vaccinated, please rest assured that Victoria Escape Games remains a safe place for you, and an unwelcoming place for those who spread ignorance and disease to the communal detriment of all,"" the management said in a statement on the company's website.

	The message prompted a coordinated backlash among anti-vaxxers, with dozens of negative reviews popping up on Google within the past two days.

	""I got the first clue this was starting yesterday morning,"" owner Derek Madson told CTV News on Tuesday. ""It was a deluge. This is not just Google. It’s everything – many voicemails, text messages, emails.""

	Madson said the anti-vaccine group was organized on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app, and boasts more than 500 members. ""These groups are literally extorting and intimidating,"" Madson said.

	Many of the negative Google reviews took issue with the business owner's comparison of anti-vaxxers to drunk drivers. Madson maintains the analogy is appropriate.

	""The threat to life and health of anti-vaxx rhetoric is equivalent to drunk driving,"" Madson said, adding he believes a group like Mothers Against Drunk Driving should organize to combat the dangers of anti-vaccine beliefs.

	""Anti-vaxxers put themselves at risk but they also put everyone else around them at risk,"" Madson said. ""My argument from the beginning is that we start treating anti-vaxxers the same we treat drunk drivers.""

	The business owner said he has been in touch with Google about removing the recent reviews but it appears to be a losing battle.

	""They're organized, they're sustained,"" he said. ""Many of these people have said they're going to drive me out of business. That’s their goal.""

	Alberta reported 422 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday as the number of active cases in the province decreased.

	There are 608 people hospitalized with the disease, 128 of whom are in intensive care, according to the province’s chief medical officer of health.

	""While we are headed in the right direction, I want to be clear that this is still a significant number of people in hospital, taxing our healthcare system,” said Dr. Deena Hinshaw.

	“We must all continue to support efforts to bring these numbers down even further.”

	Eight Albertans were reported to have died due to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, according to Hinshaw. She added that after a review, four deaths that had previously been attributed to COVID-19 were deemed to have not been caused by the disease.

	There are active alerts or outbreaks in 211 Alberta schools, and 10 had 10 or more people with COVID-19 who were in the building, according to Hinshaw.

	On Monday, Albertans will need their vaccination QR code or a negative test to enter businesses taking part in the Restrictions Exemption Program, Hinshaw added. Paper copies of vaccine records will not be accepted as of Nov. 15.

	
		Here's how Albertans can get their COVID-19 vaccine QR code


	First Nations and military vaccination records will still be accepted.

	Of Alberta’s eligible population, 87.6 per cent have received a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 81.4 are fully vaccinated.

	

			A Flourish chart


	“In Alberta, the odds of being hospitalized with COVID-19 are approximately eight times higher if you’re only partially vaccinated and 10 times higher if you’re unvaccinated,” said Hinshaw.

	BOOSTER SHOTS

	Health Canada approved booster doses for the Pfizer vaccine for people 18 and older, which Hinshaw called “encouraging.”

	
		Canada authorizes Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster for adults


	Albertans who are deemed to have an increased risk of breakthrough COVID-19 infections are already eligible for boosters. Hinshaw said there is no specific timeline for when the general public would be able to get a third dose of vaccine.

	All Albertans living in continuing care facilities have had the opportunity to get a third dose of vaccine, added Hinshaw.

	NEW TREATMENT FOR COVID-19

	Hinshaw also announced a “new tool to help prevent severe outcomes for those at the highest risk.”

	Alberta Health Services began administering sotrovimab to patients at home who are 65 and older, have COVID-19, are unvaccinated and have consented to receive it.

	“Sotrovimab is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that attaches to the spike protein of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19, and prevents the virus from entering and infecting healthy cells within your body,” according to the government of Canada website.

	The use of sotrovimab was authorized by Health Canada in July.

	It is intended to be used to treat people with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms.

	“The treatment is being rolled out across the province in a phased approach, starting with those with the highest risk of severe outcomes, like hospitalization,” said Hinshaw.

	“Let me stress that sotrovimab is not a replacement for COVID-19 vaccines… as vaccines are the most effective method to prevent serious outcomes from the disease.”

	In the update, Hinshaw also addressed “misinformation”, including a “rumor” that COVID-19 vaccines cause miscarriages.

	
		No, COVID-19 vaccines do not cause miscarriages


	“I want to assure Albertans that we continue to look at safety, including this particular question, in detail,” said Hinshaw. “There is no evidence that miscarriages or stillbirths have increased after COVID-19 vaccines have been made available.

	“In fact, evidence shows that there has been a slight, but steady, reduction in the number of miscarriages in Alberta, starting in 2019, prior to the COVID pandemic, and this has continued over the following two years.”

	Hinshaw also addressed concern over reports of a potential new variant in western Canada, which she called a sub lineage of the Delta variant.

	“It is not a different variant of concern, there’s no evidence that it causes more severe illness, that it evades vaccine protection, that it’s significantly different from the Delta variant that’s been circulating as the dominant strain in Alberta since late summer,” said Hinshaw.

	“We know that when viruses replicate, they can change their genetic slightly, so sometimes you have these sub lineages that evolve, but that doesn’t mean the behave differently from that parent strain and that’s the case with this particularly sub lineage.”

'It could mean a change of employment': Deadline approaching for COVID-19 vaccinations at local hospitals ,"Nov. 9, 2021 7:38 a.m. CST","
     
     KITCHENER - 
     
    
	Time is running out for hospital staff in Waterloo Region who have yet to be fully vaccinated.

	Starting Nov. 9, local hospitals will be enforcing its double-vaccination policy, which will require anyone entering its facilities to show proof of a second dose along with a piece of government photo ID.

	“We're making the choice based on doing all that we can,” said Lee Fairclough, the president of St. Mary’s General Hospital and the regional hospital lead for the pandemic response.

	Fairclough said at St. Mary’s, more than 99 per cent of staff are now fully vaccinated or have one dose with a signed attestation that they will get their second as soon as they become eligible.

	“For those staff who have not complied with the policy, it could mean a change of employment status with us,” said Fairclough. “Close to 1,600 staff and close to 400 physicians [have been vaccinated] so it’s a very small number of staff impacted.”

	As of October, 27 staff members at St. Mary’s were unvaccinated and placed on unpaid leave. At Grand River Hospital, 171 staff were unvaccinated and Cambridge Memorial, 51 staff had chosen not to comply with the policy.

	Though the province is not mandating hospital workers get vaccinated, hospitals in Waterloo Region want to assure the community that they are taking every level of precaution for staff, patients and visitors.

	“The policy does have some exceptions like a confirmed medical exemption... for end of life and compassionate needs for patients, we will continue to accommodate those. Some people will come in with full PPE,” said Fairclough.

	While she does not anticipate any significant staffing shortages due to the vaccine mandate, the president of SEIU healthcare, Sharleen Stewart said while most of the union’s members are in support of the policy, hospitals are still losing staff.

	“Twenty times are leaving because of the working conditions and the lack of respect and protection they are receiving out of this pandemic,” said Stewart.

	She adds hospitals across Ontario can’t afford to lose any number of staff.

	“If people don’t show up, it’s going to have an effect on the services the hospital provides,” said Stewart.

Ski hills and small business demand the removal of molecular testing requirements to spawn winter tourism ,"Nov. 9, 2021 9:57 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
     Alberta’s local ski hill operators are calling for changes to requirements that all visitors to Canada must undergo a molecular COVID-19 test 72 hours before their arrival.  Officials say this is deterring people from travelling to Canada, on the same day the United States reopened its land border to non-essential travel from Canada, for fully vaccinated Canadians.  “If the costs are $100 on either side of the border, it’s potentially a compelling reason for someone not to go,” said Pete Woods, president of the SkiBig3 in Banff.  SkiBig3 represent Lake Louise, Mount Norquay and Sunshine Village.  Currently, anyone aged four or older must take a molecular test, such as a PCR at their own cost, before coming to Canada, despite your vaccination status. Some tests can cost up to $200.  Woods believes with these added costs for a winter vacation, there could be a devastating impact on the industry, with hills opening last week.  “I think that is coupled with (the fact) that we’re just not seeing a lot of non-stop flights into Calgary,” he said.  He believes that could change if the government scrapped the requirement for the negative test result.  “These are linked. If we see the PCR test alleviated with this border opening then we will see air seats come back into Calgary and other key markets.”  Currently, anyone aged four or older must take a molecular test, such as a PCR at their own cost, before coming to Canada, despite your vaccination status. Some tests can cost up to $200.  BORDER OPENING  Monday marked the first time travellers could travel freely across the land border into the USA for nearly 21 months.  The tourism industry of Canada said it is hearing from small business that the test is wasting time and money as governments try to get the tourism sector back on its feet after more than 20 months of pandemic policies.  “It’s going to hold back a lot of Americans coming across the border,” said CEO Beth Potter.  “We’ve already seen that since August,"" she added. ""The numbers coming across the border have not been what we had hoped to see.”  Canada began allowing visitors from the U.S. with full vaccine status and a negative test in August.  But health experts warn that testing will probably be in place for quite some time.  “Although it’s maybe inconvenient, because people have to get tested, it’s for our own good,” said developmental biologist Gosia Gasperowicz from the University of Calgary.  “The third wave was mostly done by (the) Alpha variant, the UK variant. It was a variant that was not formed here, it was imported here and it caused a huge outbreak and wave that cost many lives. The fourth wave was (the) Delta variant, so again it was something that came from abroad.”  Gasperowicz said the only way testing should be taken out of requirements is if COVID-19 is completely eradicated.  She said vaccine coverage wanes over time, creating a higher risk to be re-infected and  serious consequences to your health.  NO PLANS TO CHANGE: HEALTH CANADA  Health Canada says it has no plans to change the testing requirements for visitors anytime soon.  “These border testing measures are a critical part of Canada’s COVID-19 surveillance strategy,” read a statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada.  “A pre-arrival molecular test is required in order to reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the importation of cases, the risks of transmission in transit, and risks to Canada’s domestic health care system.”  PHAC says antigen tests are not allowed, but officials are looking at whether or not to accept them in the future.  “As more evidence becomes available, and as the epidemiological situation improves in Canada and internationally, the Government of Canada will make appropriate and cautious adjustments to public health measures including border measures, with the first and foremost priority being the health and safety of Canadians,” read the statement.

Pop-up clinic for COVID-19 boosters held in Leamington ,"Nov. 9, 2021 8:26 a.m. CST","
     
     Windsor, Ont.  - 
     
    
	Expanded eligibility for the booster came into effect over the weekend.

	Over the past 24-72 hours, admission rates at Erie Shores HealthCare have risen and health official says booster shots couldn’t have come at a better time.

	“I’m here getting my booster shot. My third dose of the Pfizer vaccine,” says emergency medicine physician, Dr. Christopher Anderson.

       'Pretty significant response': WECHU says COVID-19 booster appointments filling upWECHU ready to ramp up administering COVID-19 booster shots

	Anderson took advantage of a pop-up booster shot clinic held in Leamington today.

	“It’s been almost a year since I’ve had my second shot and so I was due for my third shot. I’m just excited to get my third dose,” says Anderson.

	“We’ve been waiting for this moment, it’s been a long 20 months. We’re excited to be out in the community having access to boosters in the county today,” says Kristin Kennedy, president and CEO of Erie Shores HealthCare.

	In Essex County, the Community Response and Stabilization Team (CRST), a collaboration between Erie Shores HealthCare and Essex-Windsor EMS, are providing booster shots to eligible residents.

	To be eligible, you had to have had your second dose at least six months ago and fall under one of the following categories:

	“It is for the 70-plus population, those who have had two doses of Astra Zeneca, our healthcare workers, caregivers for those that are in long-term care as well as our indigenous,” says Kennedy. 

	Many are eager to roll up their sleeve for their third dose.

	“I kind of jumped on the opportunity when I saw cases are rising in Michigan as well and I have family there. I want to do everything I can to protect my friends and family,” says Erie Shores Healthcare registered nurse, Ciara Aucoin.

	“Being in healthcare, I see it every day so just for my own protection I feel that I need it - to do what I’m doing every day,” says Anderson.

	“I can’t wait to get my third shot,” says Leamington resident Bill Campbell.

	But some like Bill and Sandi Campbell couldn’t get their third jab today.

	“We have to wait another three weeks because it’s only been five months and one week,” says Campbell.

	Kristin Kennedy, president and CEO of Erie Shores Healthcare encourages all who are eligible to get their shot as vaccine rates in Leamington are low.

	“Erie Shores Healthcare is seeing admission rates increase related to COVID and the unvaccinated so we really want to provide access to those first and second doses so please come out, appointments are not required,” says Kennedy.

	There are more pop up clinics planned for both Leamington and Windsor.

'My question is why': Patients speak out about New Westminster pharmacy facing lawsuit over reused syringe allegations,"Nov. 8, 2021 4:18 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Two patients of a New Westminster pharmacy that is facing legal action over allegations involving reused syringe barrels for COVID-19 shots are speaking out about their experience.

	Tatiana Feka and Ray Roshan said they both went to get their second COVID-19 vaccine at Kent Pharmacy on Columbia Street on Aug. 26.

	Feka told CTV News Vancouver she found the pharmacy listed online as a place to get a COVID-19 vaccine, and chose to go there because it was the closest one.

	“You think that because it’s on a government website, you know, it’s trusted,” she said, adding that she struggles with a phobia of needles.

	“I’ve just always been paranoid of needles, so for me to go get a shot, it’s a big deal.”

	Her first experience with COVID-19 vaccination was at a large, health-authority-run clinic that used to be at the Anvil Centre community centre, and she said that went smoothly.

	Feka said after getting her shot at the pharmacy, another woman who appeared to be next in line suddenly spoke up.

	“She said, ‘No, I’m not getting my shot,’” Feka recalled. “She goes, ‘I’m not doing this here.’ She goes, ‘I saw what you did. You’re supposed to take everything brand new and throw it away and use brand new. You didn’t do that.’”

	Feka shared video she said was taken by the woman inside the pharmacy, which showed Feka sitting and waiting in a chair, and what appeared to be someone preparing a syringe behind her at a counter.

	“The girl said, ‘I videotaped you,’ and then he ran over and tried to tell her to delete the video,” Feka said. “We were just sitting there in shock.”

	Ray Roshan, who received his second COVID-19 vaccine at the pharmacy the same day as Feka, said he also witnessed the exchange.

	“I went over, I said, ‘Hey, she’s a concerned citizen,’” he said. “If you want to fight, fight with me.”

	Feka said police ended up being called.

	“He confessed right in front of us that he made a mistake,” she said. “He said he was rinsing out the barrels with saline.”   

	The pharmacy, its owner Fabina Kara, and former pharmacy manager Bhanu Prasad Seelaboyina are all named as defendants in the proposed class action suit, which alleges people who were vaccinated from Aug. 24 to 26 were potentially put at risk of contracting blood-borne illnesses such as HIV and Hepatitis C because syringe barrels were reused. None of the allegations have been tested in court.

	Feka made a complaint to the College of Pharmacists of B.C., which is now investigating. The college says until that’s complete, Seelaboyina is not able to act as a pharmacy manager or administer injections.

	The pharmacy owner confirmed to CTV News that Seelaboyina is no longer working there.

	Both Roshan and Feka have since received letters from the Fraser Health Authority recommending they go for blood testing over the next three months “out of an abundance of caution.”

	“People can be at risk of getting Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV from reuse of injection equipment,” one of the letters said. “The risk of getting these diseases from a reused syringe is low.”

	Roshan said he suffered from anxiety following his experience.

	“I couldn’t sleep for 10 straight days, I swear,” he said. “It shouldn’t be happening in Canada.”

	Both Feka and Roshan said they were later offered gift cards by the pharmacy and the pharmacy manager, which the owner did not deny. 

	Feka has also reached out to the lawyer for the proposed class action suit.

	“My question is why,” she said. “And I’m still trying to understand why.”

	CTV News spoke to the pharmacy owner by phone. She declined an on-camera interview, saying she wanted to consult legal counsel.

	Feka and Roshan also want to know how pharmacies giving vaccinations are monitored for safe practices.

	“We want people to know that things have to change,” Feka said.

"‘We have about 1,100 slots available’: Cambridge Pinebush clinic ready as COVID-19 booster eligibility expands","Nov. 7, 2021 7:57 a.m. CST","
     
     Cambridge - 
     
    
	More Ontarians are now eligible to receive a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

	Saturday marked the first day of the province’s expanded booster shot eligibility but, at the Pinebush Mass Vaccination Clinic in Cambridge, appointments could be booked as early as Wednesday.

	“We have about 1,100 slots available a day that people can book,” Liam Robinson, the clinic supervisor, told CTV News in an interview.

	The earlier booking times in Waterloo Region are a function of the local appointment system and its independence from the provincial system.

	Province-wide, the list of eligible residents for a booster shot includes:

	
		Anyone aged 70 and older
	
		Health-care workers and essential caregivers
	
		First Nations, Inuit and Metis adults and their non-indigenous household members
	
		People who received two doses of AstraZeneza or one dose of the Janssen vaccine


	Robinson believes eligible residents may have thought they had to wait until Saturday to reserve a time to get their booster.

	“We have about 360 appointments booked [Saturday],” Robinson said. “Most people heard the provincial announcement and thought [Saturday] was only the first day they were eligible in the region.”

	Bookings are required to get a third shot at the Pinebush clinic but appointments can be processed outside the clinic before going inside to be immunized.

	“I was surprised I could get my shot so early,” said Tracy Kirchner, a healthcare worker who received her third shot of vaccine on Saturday. “I thought I would have to wait a couple of days or weeks but I think it was Thursday or Friday I booked it and I was here today.”

	Officials say all third shots will be an mRNA vaccine and the Pinebush clinic says either Pfizer or Moderna can be administered.

	Eligible residents can book an appointment on the Region of Waterloo website.

"Lack of vaccine mandate at B.C.'s Whistler ski resort concerns local doctor, residents","Nov. 8, 2021 12:49 a.m. CST","
     
     Whistler, B.C. - 
     
    
	With cooler weather on the way, and snow already falling in the mountains, skiers and snowboarders are looking forward to the upcoming season — but some say they won’t be hitting the slopes at British Columbia’s most famous resort.

	Chief among their concerns is that many of the resort’s ski lifts are enclosed gondolas that are often tightly packed.

	“There is no other place that we are shoulder to shoulder, leg to leg, breath to breath, with other people in such a closed air space,” said Cathy Zeglinski, a Whistler resident and medical doctor.  B.C. adds 497 cases as Canada approves 1st COVID-19 vaccine for kidsFull coverage at CTVNews.ca/CoronavirusIs B.C. flooding affecting the province's COVID-19 numbers?

	She’s concerned about riding the gondolas at Whistler Blackcomb because the company will not be requiring proof-of-vaccination for guests this season.

	Vail Resorts, which operates Whistler Blackcomb, notes masks are mandatory on lifts and gondolas.

	“We will continue to monitor and follow all local and provincial public health orders,” the company said in a statement to CTV News Vancouver.

	Long-time Whistler resident John Konig doesn’t think that’s good enough.

	He usually skis 80 to 90 days per year but only went twice last season because of concerns about COVID-19.

	This year, he doesn’t know if he’ll go at all.

	“I’m 69 years old. My vaccine (immunity) will be waning this winter. It’ll be six months once we start skiing. So, I think a lot of people have concerns,” he said.

	Konig started a petition hoping to get the company to reverse course.

	It has garnered nearly 9,000 signatures.

	Whistler Blackcomb had to close early last year, as the resort municipality became one of BC’s COVID-19 hotspots, prompting the province to offer immunization to all adults in the community very early in the vaccine rollout.

	“People here were so excited to get vaccinated because they all want to get back to normal,” said Zeglinski.

	Meanwhile, Grouse Mountain, a much smaller ski hill close to Metro Vancouver, will require all guests to be fully vaccinated for the upcoming ski season.

	In Whistler, given the limited number of open-air lifts and ubiquity of enclosed gondolas, Zeglinski said she can’t understand why the company operating the slopes doesn’t follow Grouse Mountain’s lead.

	“Any of us that have skied know that you don’t spend five minutes on a gondola,” she said. “You spend, 20, 30, 40. Lifts break down. You may spend an hour.”

	Whistler Blackcomb plans to open for the season on Nov. 25, but unless the company updates it’s vaccine policy, neither Konig or Zeglinski will be lining up.

     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Alberta's unemployment rate dropped enough last month to bring the province close to its pre-pandemic rate.

	According to Statistics Canada’s October 2021 Labour Force Survey, Alberta had a jobless rate of 7.6 per cent last month, down five-tenths of a percentage point from September (8.1) and only slightly higher than the 7.5 per cent recorded in February 2020 before COVID-19 hit.

	The survey, released on Friday, reflects labour market conditions the week of Oct. 10 to 16, three weeks after the introduction of the Alberta's Restrictions Exception Program (REP), a vaccine passport.

       Alberta's unemployment rate climbs to 8.1% in SeptemberCanadian economy added 31,000 jobs in October, unemployment rate hits pandemic-era low

	At the time ofthe survey, people were only required to have one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine to enter businesses that had opted in to the program. On Oct. 22, that requirement increased to only allow fully vaccinated patrons.

	Alberta's October 2021 jobless rate is significantly lower than it was last year, when it sat at 10.7 per cent.

	 ""October’s job numbers show that Alberta’s economic recovery continues, with an increase of 9,000 new full-time jobs. While, unfortunately, part-time employment decreased, our unemployment rate fell once again and is now lower than any point during the pandemic,"" Minister of Jobs Doug Schweitzer said in a statement.

	The NDP, however, took aim at Alberta's United Conservative Party, saying recovery is still very fragile.

	""The Premier and his UCP government keep telling Albertans that everything is fine, but these figures tell a different story,"" energy critic Kathleen Ganley said in a statement. ""Albertans are already struggling to pay their bills and now they’re facing job loss under the UCP government.""

	""While other provinces have fully recovered job losses from the pandemic, Alberta lags behind due to the UCP’s mishandling of COVID-19 that has made our economic crisis deeper and will prolong our recovery,"" economic development and innovation critic Deron Bilous said.

	""While the premier was on vacation, our province was sent into a deadly fourth wave that had devastating effects on our economy. Albertans deserve answers on why the premier let this happen.""

	Though both Calgary and Edmonton saw unemployment drop in October, their rates remained among the highest of the 34 metropolitan areas surveyed.

	In Calgary, unemployment continued to drop significantly, sitting at 8.0 per cent in October compared to 8.9 per cent the month prior.

	“We are seeing some promising signs of economic growth in Calgary with a second straight month of strong improvements in the job market,"" Dexter Lam from Calgary Economic Development said in a statement.

	""Many cities in Canada saw people leaving their labour forces, but a significant number of Calgarians started seeking work in October, and still more Calgarians found jobs.""

	Edmonton's unemployment rate dropped two-tenths of a percentage point in September to sit at 8.0 per cent.

	Only Toronto and Windsor, Ont. saw higher jobless rates at 8.4 per cent and 9.2 per cent respectively.

	 Public Health says it is closely monitoring all four health zones for community spread.

	N.S. TO OFFER BOOSTER DOSES BY END OF NOVEMBER

	Nova Scotia plans to begin administering COVID-19 booster doses to more eligible groups by the end of this month.

	During Friday’s news update, Strang announced that the province will accept all five recommendations announced by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) on Oct. 29.

	Those recommendations include offering boosters to people with a higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness or decreased protection since vaccination.

	“As we prepare to offer booster doses, our first priority will continue to be encouraging people who have one or no doses of COVID vaccine to get vaccinated,” said Strang. “Boosters may provide an added level of protection, but the best way to reduce the spread of the virus is to ensure that everyone has at least two doses of vaccine.”

	Groups who will now be eligible for a booster dose in Nova Scotia include:

	
		anyone 80 and older, followed by anyone ages 70 to 79
	
		adult frontline healthcare workers who were double vaccinated with an interval of less than 28 days between their first and second doses
	
		people who received two doses of the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD vaccine or one dose of Janssen vaccine


	The province says they are also engaging with Indigenous and African Nova Scotian communities on the best way to offer booster doses in those communities.

	Nova Scotia has previously made booster doses available for moderately to severely immunocompromised people, people living in long-term care and people who are required to travel for work to a country that does not recognize a mixed vaccine series.

	NACI recommends that booster doses be offered at least six months after the primary series is completed.

	The province says planning for the booster doses is underway, and updates to the vaccine booking system are being made. More information will be announced once booking for booster doses opens.

	NACI also recommended last month that the optimal interval between first and second doses is eight weeks. Nova Scotians can still schedule their second dose as early as 28 days after the first but are encouraged to follow the NACI recommendation and wait eight weeks for their second dose.

	EXPOSURE NOTICE FOR TWO SCHOOLS

	Health officials also sent exposure notices for two schools in the province on Thursday.

	The latest school exposures are at Charles P. Allen High in Bedford and Burton Ettinger Elementary in Halifax.

	“It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious,” said N.S. Health in a release.

	A list of schools with exposures is available online.

	COVID-19 CASE DATA

	Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 3,204 tests on Thursday. A total of 1,328,408 COVID-19 tests have been processed since the start of the pandemic.

	There were 28,608 rapid tests administered between Oct. 29 and Nov. 4. This includes 1,488 rapid tests at the pop-up sites in Halifax, Dartmouth, Amherst and Kentville and 27,120 through the workplace screening program. Another 8,661 home rapid tests were distributed at the pop-up sites.

	According to the province's online COVID-19 dashboard, there have been 7,550 cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nova Scotia. Of those, 7,229 people have recovered and 101 have died due to COVID-19.

"COVID-19 'now a preventable disease,' B.C.'s top doctor says","Nov. 5, 2021 10:57 p.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C.'s top doctor is calling COVID-19 ""a preventable disease,"" citing effectiveness of vaccines as the reason.

	In a modelling presentation Thursday, Dr. Bonnie Henry outlined what B.C.'s COVID-19 caseload would be without vaccines. Currently, the reproductive number in the province is at or below one in nearly all regions, meaning each new confirmed infection is spreading, on average, to just one other person, or fewer. 

	Without vaccination, Thursday's modelling presentation suggested the virus' reproductive number would be 3.43, and cases would be growing exponentially, surpassing 8,000 per day in a matter of just a few weeks.

	""This is showing us how important and how protective and effective the vaccines that we have are,"" Henry said. ""This is now a preventable disease, particularly in severe illness, hospitalizations.""

	The modelling data presented Thursday also revealed an updated estimate of how much more likely individuals are to get infected, end up in hospital or die from COVID-19 if they are unvaccinated.

	Adjusted for age, unvaccinated individuals are 10 times more likely to test positive for COVID-19, the data suggested, and 46 times more likely to die from the disease.

	But the risk of hospitalization is even higher.

	""Just to underline the age adjusted number, 50 times more likely to be in hospital if you're unvaccinated. Fifty times,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix said. ""I think it's important to reflect on that.""

	Even with vaccinations, Henry said the biggest risk factor for COVID-19 continues to be age. In fact, the modelling presentation indicated that 46 per cent of the 179 deaths during October were among those who had received two doses of a vaccine.

	""Our seniors and elders continue to be vulnerable and that's why we've rolled out the booster dose to them so quickly,"" Henry said.

	As of Thursday, 90.1 per cent of eligible people aged 12 and older have received their first COVID-19 dose and 85.6 per cent have received two. The province's plan to offer booster shots is continuing to roll out and Dix said that process is nearly complete in long-term care and assisted living homes.

	""Booster-dose vaccination is 98 per cent complete in long-term care and seniors assisted living facilities across the province with 526 of 536 facilities receiving their booster dose to date,"" he said.

	Booster doses are being offered to other groups most vulnerable to the disease first and will be available to the general population through a gradual roll-out starting next year.

B.C. COVID-19 modelling shows what the province's caseload would look like without vaccines,"Nov. 5, 2021 5:54 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C.'s latest modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic shows transmission of the coronavirus flat or declining across the province, with a previous spike in cases among children seemingly over.

	COVID-19's reproductive number is at or below one in all regions of the province, meaning each new confirmed infection is spreading, on average, to just one other person, or fewer.

	That's a recipe for continued declining cases, something health officials attribute to widespread vaccination.  B.C. adds 497 cases as Canada approves 1st COVID-19 vaccine for kidsFull coverage at CTVNews.ca/CoronavirusIs B.C. flooding affecting the province's COVID-19 numbers?

	B.C.'s medium-range projection, however, assumes a reproductive number of 1.07, with cases remaining relatively flat at their current levels, according to the slides presented by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry in a news conference Thursday afternoon.

	Currently, B.C. is seeing just over 500 new cases of COVID-19 per day, down from a high in the mid-700s earlier in the fourth wave.

	Without vaccination, the modelling presentation suggests, the virus' reproductive number would be 3.43, and cases would be growing exponentially, surpassing 8,000 per day in a matter of just a few weeks.

	Both projections are based on the existing rules put in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus. If there were no vaccines, B.C. would almost certainly need stricter regulations to keep the virus in check and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.

	With B.C. headed into what she calls ""respiratory season,"" Henry said the existing rules that have helped the province get its reproductive number down to its current level need to stay in place.

	""We have, right now, a fragile balance,"" the provincial health officer said. ""We're going down slowly … This is not the time to let off, in any way, on the things we are doing to protect ourselves, our families and our communities.""

	Henry listed five things she says B.C. residents should do for their health and that of their community. Four of them relate to vaccination. They are: getting a booster dose when it's your turn; getting your first and second doses right away if you haven't; getting an influenza vaccine to protect against the flu; and registering younger children to get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they're eligible.

	The fifth thing British Columbians should do, according to Henry, is stay home if they are sick and continue to take actions to limit the spread of COVID-19, such as keeping distance, wearing masks and getting tested as soon as possible when symptoms develop.

	Henry described ""stubbornly high rates of hospitalization"" as B.C.'s ""biggest challenge"" over the last couple of months.

	Health Minister Adrian Dix said more than 100 patients have now been relocated from hospitals in B.C.'s north to other areas of the province.

	The province hit a 25-week high for COVID-19-related hospitalizations earlier this week. 

	Henry attributed B.C.'s high number of hospitalizations to a combination of factors, including the highly transmissible Delta variant leading to more serious illness among younger people - particularly those who are unvaccinated - as well as breakthrough cases among older people who are fully vaccinated, but whose immune systems mount a less robust response to immunization than younger people's do.

	For this reason, older people have been prioritized for booster shots, Henry said. 

	Age has always been, and continues to be, the biggest risk factor for COVID-19, the provincial health officer added.

	Many of those who died from COVID-19 in B.C. in the month of October were older people who were fully vaccinated, Henry said. The modelling presentation indicated that 46 per cent of the 179 deaths during the month were among those who had received two doses of a vaccine.

	Forty-nine per cent of the deaths were among unvaccinated people, and those deaths tended to be among people who were younger, on average, than those who were fully vaccinated and died, according to Henry.

	An unvaccinated person is 46 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than a fully vaccinated person of the same age, and 50 times more likely to be hospitalized, Henry said.

	The latest data came after an update from the province on the projected spread of COVID-19. Earlier in the day, the provincial health officer presented modelling data showing transmission of the novel coronavirus is flat or declining across B.C., and suggesting a previous spike in cases among children is over. 

	It's positive news, but B.C. is still dealing with 4,451 active cases as of Thursday's update, 438 of whom are being treated in hospital.

	The province does not provide daily updates on how many hospitalized patients are vaccinated, but officials say the majority of those with infections and in hospital beds are not fully vaccinated, or have received no shots at all.

	As of the latest update, there are 130 people being treated in intensive care units across the province.

	Half of the just-confirmed cases were recorded in Fraser Health – unsurprisingly, as the health authority is the province's most populous. Three of the deaths were also in Fraser Health, while two were in Vancouver Coastal and the remaining three were in the Northern Health region.

	Northern Health is still seeing the most cases per capita.

	Adding two new health-care facility outbreaks to the list, B.C. is now dealing with a total of 37. 

	As of Thursday, 90.1 per cent of eligible people in B.C. had received at least one of their two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and 85.6 per cent have had both shots.

     REGINA - 
     
    
	The Saskatchewan government says the province's fourth wave is waning as COVID-19 cases decline, but health officials say hospitals are still under significant pressure.

	Dr. Saqib Shahab, chief medical health officer, said Tuesday that it will take four to six weeks for hospitals to return to sustainable levels -- and that's only if people remain vigilant by getting vaccinated and reducing gathering sizes.

	""Daily case numbers are coming down and I'm sure we're all hearing a sigh of relief, but we have to remain cautious,"" Shahab said.

       COVID-19 pandemic forces delay of 26K surgeries in Sask. Fewer than 10 patients have used antibody treatment in Sask.5 COVID-19 deaths, 107 new cases reported in Sask. 

	The province reported 107 cases, down from a peak of 650 cases five weeks ago.

	There were 222 people in hospital with the virus, 48 of them receiving intensive care. The province's ICUs remained 123 per cent over baseline capacity.

	The Saskatchewan Health Authority said it's too early to tell if the drop in cases is a trend.

	""(Health-care workers) are tired, they're exhausted, they've been working at a very, very high acuity rate in our ICUs for multiple weeks,"" said Scott Livingstone, the health authority's CEO. ""This type of care is not sustainable.""

	Shahab said there are rural areas where 30 to 40 per cent of eligible populations remain unvaccinated, which is enough to drive more substantive waves of COVID-19.

	""We need to remain extremely vigilant over the winter months,"" he said.

	As a result of the extreme pressure that COVID-19 has put on hospitals, the backlog of those waiting for elective surgery is at 35,000, said Health Minister Paul Merriman.

	Livingstone added it could take 18 months to catch up on hip and knee surgeries alone, not including anyone newly added to the waiting list.

	""We've got a big hill to climb on getting our surgical numbers back to an acceptable level,"" said Merriman.

	He said his ministry has set aside $20 million for surgeries but will need even more money in the coming year to address the backlog.

	The province remains without a plan to expand its surgical capacity, including how it will find additional health-care workers to help with the backlog.

	""We haven't built a plan, approved and staffed (it), because we're still in the middle of the pandemic,"" Livingstone said.

	If people reduced their gathering sizes, the 275 health-care services that have been reduced would be able to resume sooner, he added.

	Merriman said he won't bring in restrictions on gathering sizes because the province's proof of vaccine policy and mask mandate is bringing case numbers down.

	""It is working. Further restrictions right now, I don't think they're warranted,"" Merriman said.

	He later added that the Saskatchewan Party government is doing everything it can to help surgeries resume.

	NDP Opposition Leader Ryan Meili called Merriman an ""incompetent minister that has failed this province drastically.""

	""I don't think this minister has a good sense of how the health-care system works, and I don't believe he is listening fully to key leaders within the health-care system, including Dr. Shahab,"" Meili said.

	New data from the Angus Reid Institute sheds light on the top reasons Canadians aren't rolling up their sleeves for the COVID-19 vaccine.

	Topping the list - personal freedoms and doubt around the severity of the virus.

    Advertisement
    
	Ninety per cent of the unvaccinated surveyed said they believe the health risks of COVID-19 are overstated, while 84 per cent believe their immune system alone is strong enough to fight off the virus.

	The poll also shows that misinformation appears to be playing a role, with 55 percent of unvaccinated people agreeing with the statement: “COVID-19 is a conspiracy that is all about government control.""

	Of the 505 Manitobans polled, 12 per cent are unvaccinated. Of those, 98 per cent say they haven't gotten the jab because they believe COVID-19 is not a serious health threat.

	Another key takeaway – men, particularly those aged 18 to 34, refuse to be vaccinated at a higher rate than women. Twelve per cent said of those surveyed they would not get the vaccine.

	The online survey was conducted between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3 with randomized sample of 5,011 Canadian adults.

	The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit is rolling out COVID-19 booster shots to eligible residents with prioritized groups able to book their third mRNA vaccine starting Wednesday.

	The Ontario government announced Wednesday it is expanding eligibility for booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to additional groups of high-risk individuals starting Nov. 6, 2021, providing an extra layer of protection against the Delta variant. Over the coming months, the province said it is also prepared to gradually roll out booster doses to all Ontarians aged 12 and over.

	Health unit CEO Nicole Dupuis said they are ready since the government asked all public health units in the fall to create a plan for third dose vaccinations.

	“We have a very good plan in Windsor-Essex I believe. We’ve got great partners with our hospitals,” said Dupuis.

	Dupuis said the vaccination clinic at Devonshire Mall will help with increased demand.

	“We’ve continued our mass vaccination site, so that’ll certainly be a big part of our rollout plan. We have a lot of capacity within that clinic, and we feel confident we’re ready to go,” she said.

	The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) expanded eligibility for booster shots last week.

	Based on the recommendation of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and in alignment with NACI’s recent recommendation, the province will begin offering booster doses to the following vulnerable populations if at least six months have passed since their last dose:

	
		Individuals aged 70 and over (born in 1951 or earlier);
	
		Health care workers and designated essential caregivers in congregate settings (including long-term care home and retirement home staff and designated caregivers);
	
		Individuals who received a complete series of a viral vector vaccine (two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine or one dose of the Janssen vaccine); and
	
		First Nation, Inuit and Métis adults and their non-Indigenous household members.
	
		Moore said booster doses are being offered to these groups based on evidence of gradual waning immunity six months after receiving their second dose and a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.


	Dupuis said residents should be familiar with the appointment booking system, since it was also used for the first and second doses.

	“We’ll use our online booking system, as we have in the past,” she said. “Those that have already received a vaccination will be familiar with the process. We do have our booking call centre as well. The number hasn’t changed, and individuals can call if they need greater assistance.”

	WECHU reports 5,218 residents have received a third dose/booster shot of a vaccine to date.

	The Community Response and Stabilization Team (CRST) and Essex-Windsor EMS will start administering booster shots to the following groups of people at least six months after their second dose:

	Age 70+ (Birth year 1951);

	Healthcare workers and designated essential caregivers in congregate settings

	Ontarians who had TWO doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine

	First Nations, Inuit and Métis people and non-Indigenous members of their households

	The CRST will starting providing booster shots to those eligible starting Monday, Nov. 8 at weekly pop-up clinics in West Windsor and Leamington.

		Vancouver Coastal Health – 56 cases, a rate of 4.5 per 100,000 population


	Another 740 people have recovered from COVID-19 as well, according to the ministry, leaving the province's active caseload at 4,373, the lowest it's been since Aug. 13.

	The government announced one new outbreak at Hallmark on the Park, an assisted living facility in Abbotsford. Two others, at Heritage Village and Magnolia Gardens, have ended, leaving the province with 40 active outbreaks across its health-care system.

Nova Scotia gives public-sector workers eight more weeks to get COVID-19 vaccine,"Nov. 4, 2021 9:05 a.m. CST","
     
     HALIFAX - 
     
    
	Nova Scotia is hoping that a little more time is all public sector employees need to adhere to public health's vaccine mandate.

	""This mandate was in no way intended to penalize people so if there are folks who previously hadn't considered vaccination who have gotten the knowledge that they needed in order to do that,"" says Nova Scotia Health Minister Michelle Thompson.

	Now, workers who have their first shot by Nov. 15 will have an extra two months to roll up their sleeves and get their second.

	Nova Scotia's NDP leader supports the extension.

	""There are many, many considerations involved in this whole vaccine related question but when you take all things together this seems to be a prudent course of action,"" says Gary Burrill.

	Those who don't meet the deadline will be placed on unpaid leave.

	Many of them are represented by the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union.

	""What we tend to do is take the issues on a case by case basis and see what the reasons are, the mitigating factors, and really try to piece together a case for our members if they do indeed do have a case,"" says union president Jason MacLean.

	The extension applies to more than 80,000 employees in schools, corrections, child-care centres and hospitals.

	Zach Churchill, the Liberal party's health critic, has some concerns over how the mandate will affect staffing levels.

	""It's really important for the public to know if this policy he's going to exacerbate the labour shortage in our healthcare systems and if that's going to impact service delivery for surgeries, for our emergency departments, for our long-term care sector,"" he said.

	Thompson says her department is working on a contingency plan to deal with the loss of unvaccinated workers.

	The government hasn't released data on how many public sector workers risk being placed on leave for not getting vaccinated.

	In a statement released Monday, Interior Health said the South Similkameen Health Centre in Keremeos is shortening its emergency department hours ""due to limited physician availability.""

	Last week, the vaccine mandate requiring staff to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 came into effect. On Monday, Health Minister Adrian Dix said 3,325 health-care workers remain unvaccinated and are on unpaid leave. Of those, 1,018 are in Interior Health, making up five per cent of that region's staff.

	Neither the health ministry nor the health authority said Keremeos health centre's hour reduction was because of unvaccinated staff, but Dix addressed the community directly while discussing vaccination during a news conference Monday.

	""It's been a challenge in the Interior Health Authority,"" Dix said of vaccine rates, adding that two operating rooms in the entire region had to temporarily close due to shortages.

	""There's some impact on lab times and responses and in communities such as Keremeos where a large percentage of a relatively small group of people in the facility there means that hours are being adjusted … none of this is desirable but it's necessary.""

	The Interior Health Authority says Keremeos residents requiring emergency assistance should call 911.

	They make up 85 per cent of current critical care patients, 67.5 per cent of all hospitalizations from Oct. 15 to 28, and 58.6 per cent of all cases from Oct. 22 to 28, according to the Ministry of Health.'

	

	

	Officials also announced six new health-care facility outbreaks on Monday, at Cascade Gardens, The Cedars, Hallmark on the Lake, Brocklehurst Gemstone Care Centre, Sun Point Village, and Chartwell Malaspina Care Residence.

	The province is now working to contain 39 active outbreaks across the health-care system, the ministry said.

"B.C. residents who got 2 AstraZeneca doses may get booster shot sooner, health officials announce","Nov. 2, 2021 2:50 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C. residents who received two AstraZeneca shots to protect themselves against COVID-19 may receive an invitation to get their booster shot a little earlier than others.

	Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry shared the update during a morning news conference Monday, saying B.C.'s booster-dose program is moving forward. The top doctor announced last week that third doses would be available to the general public starting in the new year.

	Henry said those individuals ""still have very strong, good protection for serious illness,"" but their protection from infection isn't as robust.

	""As a result, people who received two doses of AstraZeneca will be receiving invitations for their booster dose at six months,"" she said. ""This may be sooner than other healthy adults in the community where we know there's very good, strong protection that's lasting well.""

	When Henry announced the booster-dose program, she said invitations will be sent out between six and eight months after a person received their second shot, with the specific timing of that rollout determined by age and level of vulnerability.

	Henry said all booster doses – including for those who got AstraZeneca – will be with an mRNA vaccine.

	""That combination, particularly a viral vector and an mRNA combination has been shown to be very effective and long-lasting,"" she said.

	Last week, Henry presented some local data on the effectiveness of vaccines. Against all infections, including the Delta variant, two doses of AstraZeneca was proving to be 72 per cent effective. By comparison, two doses of Pfizer or a mix of AstraZeneca and an mRNA was 91 per cent effective at preventing infection. Two doses of Moderna had the highest rate at 92 per cent.

	A modified MLHU Section 22 Order that had been in place limiting organized public events and social gatherings has been fully lifted in line with changes to provincial regulations.

	On Wednesday the province lifted capacity limits for outdoor organized public events, though masks must be worn. Limits remain in place for private gatherings indoors (25 people) and outdoors (100 people) and indoor organized public gatherings (25).

	“The Reopening Ontario Act still sets capacity limits for social events and indoor organized gatherings,” said Dr. Alex Summers, MLHU associate medical officer of health in a statement. “These limits continue to be important and will be enforced as we all aim to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.”

	The health unit recommends gatherings be held outdoors as much as possible, with distancing and masking when distancing is not possible.

	B.C. health officials announced 584 new cases of COVID-19 and nine related deaths in their final pandemic update of the week Friday.

	Friday's numbers bring the seven day rolling averages for daily cases and deaths to 575 and 6.71, respectively.

	Ongoing high levels of COVID-19 transmission prompted provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry to extend the province's indoor mask mandate on Friday. 

	Henry's order requiring everyone ages five and older to wear face masks in indoor public spaces had originally been scheduled to end on Oct. 31. 

	There have been no new outbreaks of COVID-19 in health-care facilities in the province, but the Ministry of Health announced a new outbreak at the Vancouver Island Regional Correctional Centre in Saanich.

	The ministry did not say how many cases were associated with the prison outbreak. There are currently 33 ongoing outbreaks in health-care settings across the province.

	Most people contracting COVID-19 and requiring hospitalization in B.C. are unvaccinated. Those who have not been vaccinated accounted for 65.1 per cent of cases over the last week and 73.8 per cent of hospitalizations over the last two, according to the ministry.

	Health Minister Adrian Dix once again tweeted a breakdown of the vaccination status of people in intensive care in the province, saying 86 per cent of those in ICUs were not fully vaccinated. 

	Those who are unvaccinated make up an especially disproportionate number of cases and hospitalizations considering the fact that they represent roughly one-fifth of B.C.'s total population.

	If vaccines did nothing, the unvaccinated would be expected to make up about one-fifth of cases and hospitalizations, in line with their proportion of the population.

	As of Friday, 89.8 per cent of eligible B.C. residents ages 12 and older had received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 85 per cent were fully vaccinated. 

	The largest share of new cases announced Friday was in the Fraser Health region, where 232 new infections were discovered.

	On a per-capita basis, however, Northern Health continues to have the highest case rate. The region added 104 new cases on Friday, equivalent to 34.7 cases per 100,000 residents.

	Fraser Health's much larger population means it added just 12 cases per 100,000.

	Interior Health saw 85 new cases on Friday, Island Health 82 and Vancouver Coastal Health 81.

	Of the new deaths reported Friday, three were in Fraser Health, two were in Vancouver Coastal Health, two were in Northern Health and two were in Island Health.

	The United States land border reopens to fully vaccinated Canadians for non-essential travel on Nov.8, but certain federal quarantine rules will still be in effect for those who are unvaccinated, including children not yet eligible to receive a vaccine.

	Local school boards are working on messaging ahead of the border reopening so that parents can be informed before making travel plans.

    Advertisement
    
	A letter to parents from administrators at one local school reminds parents that “if an unvaccinated student has crossed the border for day-trips, sports, travel, etc., when they return to Canada, regardless if they have received a negative PCR test and have travelled with fully vaccinated parent(s), they fall under the Federal Quarantine and cannot attend school for 14 days.”

	The Greater Essex County District School Board is still working on finalizing messaging. The Windsor-Essex Catholic School Board says they are also working with the health unit to provide information on the updated regulations.

	The WECDSB issued a statement on Friday:

	""We are currently waiting for more detailed instructions from the provincial government regarding any restrictions that may be imposed upon students and school board staff upon their return to Canada if they travel to the United States after the border opens on November 8. In the meantime, we would certainly recommend that parents do their research about current federal regulations before making any travel plans, and closely follow any guidance or restrictions they receive from the Canada Border Services Agency upon their return. We would recommend they use the federal government's COVID-19 travel page for more detailed information: travel.gc.ca/travel-covid""

	Under the federal rules, fully vaccinated students would be able to return to school after returning to Canada with a negative PCR test. Children who are under 12 years old are ineligible to get vaccinated in Canada.

	Toronto-based travel insurance broker Martin Firestone says there is still some uncertainty regarding requirements.

	“It appears that there are just going to be requirements that are going to be necessary and how they’re going to be handled is all up in the air,” says Firestone.

	He says families are making vacation plan only to pull the plug when they learn these rules.

	“Many clients of mine who actually were booking Christmas vacations, have major concerns that after spending that two week lovely vacation to then be back home with two weeks quarantine in the home is just not going to fly, literally. So with that in mind, they’re cancelling those plans, if that’s the case,” says Firestone.

	Hillier, who represents the eastern Ontario riding of Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston, has frequently posted COVID-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories throughout the pandemic.

	The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines have been widely accepted by experts around the world.

	Families of those posted have come forward saying they were upset by the post and denied Hillier’s allegations.

	They include a complaint by Farisa Navab’s family. They say the 20-year-old Cambridge woman died in September from a rare blood disorder, not a COVID-19 vaccine.

	Hillier, who was kicked out of the Progressive Conservative caucus before the pandemic, has called on police to investigate the deaths.

	MPPs are expected to adhere to the members' Integrity Act.

	A member of the Integrity Commissioner’s Office said they can only investigate whether a breach has occurred if another MPP files a request under the Act.

	Last Friday, Waterloo NDP MPP Catherine Fife and NDP House Leader MPP Peggy Sattler submitted a co-written a letter to Integrity Commissioner David Wake.

	Also last Friday Premier Ford called Hillier’s post disgusting.

	Thursday’s motion - unanimously adopted by members of the legislature - said the house dissociates itself from Hillier's conduct. It also calls on him to apologize and ""desist from further conduct that is inappropriate and unbecoming"" of a member of the legislature.

	""Mr. Hillier’s decision to use the photograph and name of a deceased woman on social media, falsely claiming that her death was caused by the COVID-19 vaccine and his further refusal to remove this content continues to be extremely hurtful to the affected family and is unacceptable from any person let alone an elected Member of Provincial Parliament,"" the statement from the legislature said.

	“The actions we have taken have had a positive impact,” said Higgs during Thursday’s news update. We went from over 1000 positive cases to 549, and a high of 68 people in hospital to 31. However our hospitals are still under pressure with 120 regional health authority staff absent due to COVID-related reasons.”

	Hospitalization triggers in the mandatory order are what the province uses to decide whether to lift the circuit breaker, Higgs told CTV Atlantic in an interview Thursday.

	""We wanted to get down to 10 in hospital,"" Higgs said. ""We had a kind of a range here, of less than 25, but down to 10 to reduce a mandatory order. Our hospitalizations were still in red, and maybe we'll go to orange, but we're still having impacts on elective surgeries.""

Chatham-Kent’s top doctor concerned over reaction to lifting of pandemic measures ,"Oct. 29, 2021 1:43 a.m. CST","
     
     Windsor, Ont.  - 
     
    
	Chatham-Kent’s medical officer of health-expressed concern some people might read too much into comments about pandemic measures like vaccine passports possibly being lifted in the New Year.

	Dr. David Colby thought the statement could become another reason for hesitancy, and asked, “What are people waiting for?”

    Advertisement
    
	During a news conference in Toronto on Oct. 22, the province announced the plan to manage the spread of COVID-19 would continue into January when it hoped to lift vaccine certificate requirements in settings officials deem are lower risk.

	Starting on Jan. 17, 2022, restaurants, sporting facilities and casino could host patrons without checking vaccination status, as long there are no concerning trends of virus transmission at that time.

	Colby cautioned people might be holding out thinking the pandemic will be over in a couple of months.

	“I’d be overjoyed if that happen,” says Colby. “Do I think that is likely, I think we will be dealing with this for quite a while yet.”

	Colby was pleased to announce 80 per cent of Chatham-Kent’s population 12 years old and up had received a double dose of vaccine, but remained concern about the unvaccinated population as the virus has been unpredictable.

	“No one anticipated the Delta strain,” stated Colby who added if it was not for the variant, “…we’d have enough herd immunity to be done with it.”

	Meanwhile, Chatham-Kent Council is expected to review a bylaw requiring wearing masks indoors.

	“When we adopted the mask by-law there was no requirement from the province,” said Mayor Darrin Canniff.

	The municipality’s CAO said the municipality still needed to abide by the safe reopening act.

	However, depending on what happens, “…we might have to require masks,” said Don Shropshire.

Assiniboine Park Zoo to vaccinate some animals against COVID-19,"Oct. 28, 2021 2:43 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	Some of the animals at Assiniboine Park Zoo will soon join nearly a million Manitobans in getting their COVID-19 vaccine.

	According to Dr. Chris Enright, director of veterinary services and animal welfare at the zoo, as a veterinary COVID-19 vaccine becomes available the zoo will begin to immunize some of its animals, including gibbons and tigers.

    Advertisement
    
	“Members of our species that we know are going to be susceptible, we’re going to add this level of protection to it,” he said.

	Enright said there is an evolving understanding of COVID-19 in the veterinary world, but they have learned that some wild animals are susceptible to it, including primates and members of the cat family.

	He said as COVID-19 has infected people across the world, it has also been found in some pets, as well as zoo animals.

	“It’s happened in zoo situations where it’s spilled over from people into members of the cat family, like lions, tigers, and snow leopards, as well as members of the primate family, like gorillas and orangutans,” Enright explained.

	Enright said the veterinary vaccine currently being developed is being created for domestic animals.

	“The vaccine we're acquiring is a veterinary-specific vaccine from a company called Zoetis,” he said.

	“It will be a series of two vaccinations using actually a different technology from the mRNA vaccines that we’re all hearing about for people.”

	Enright explained that the way they are going to administer the vaccine will depend on the animal.

	“Some of our animals are able to participate in their veterinary care and they present their shoulder for a vaccination,” he said. ""They know if they do it, they’ll get a click and they’ll get a treat,” he said

	Enright added that some animals aren’t as far along in their training so the vets have the option of administering it with a blowpipe or putting the animal under anesthesia.

	“We have a really comprehensive veterinary program and that includes checkups and vaccinations,” he said.

	“We already vaccinate things like our gibbons for a number of diseases already. COVID-19 is a vaccine that we’re going to add in on top of that.”

'I have no regrets at all': Victoria woman suffers allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine,"Oct. 28, 2021 1:22 a.m. CST","
     
     Victoria  - 
     
    
	A 32-year-old Victoria woman says she has no regrets about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, despite suffering an extremely rare allergic reaction after her first shot.

	Annie Taal got her first dose at the Archie Browning centre in Esquimalt in late May. She began to feel sick within minutes of leaving the vaccine centre, according to Island Health.

	“I couldn’t take a deep breath,"" she told the health authority, which shared her story in a media release Wednesday. ""I was winded and felt like I had a sunburn.""

	Taal returned to the recreation centre where nurses determined she was having an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine.

	The Victoria woman was diagnosed with serious allergies as a teenager and had asked her doctor whether or not she should get the COVID-19 vaccine, Island Health says.

	She was advised that the risks of contracting COVID-19 far outweighed those of an allergic reaction, according to the health authority.

	“I have no regrets at all,"" Taal said. ""I understand the fear and uncertainty many people are feeling, but the fact-based evidence shows us the vaccines are safe and they are the best way for us to move forward through the pandemic.”

	Taal was taken to Victoria General Hospital for observation after nurses at the recreation centre treated her.

	She was later referred to an immunologist in Victoria to determine if she could receive a second dose of vaccine. They used a technique called graded-dose administration – where the full dose is separated into smaller doses and provided over a span of time with close monitoring – and Taal is now fully vaccinated, according to Island Health.

	Taal was asked to participate in a study of people who have experienced an allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine.

	“I am grateful to be part of this study because we really don’t know yet why some people have these rare reactions,” she said. “If I can help just one person feel safer about getting their shot, it will be worth it.”

	Dr. Michael Benusic with Island Health says a very small number of people will react to the COVID-19 vaccine.

	“Severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are very rare – about 1 in 100,000 people will react,"" Benusic said. ""Our vaccination sites are set up to identify and respond to this when it occurs, which is exactly what happened with this patient.""

	A spokesperson for Island Health declined to say how many similar allergic reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine have been recorded in the island region, instead referring the question to the BC Centre for Disease Control.

	Island Health says approximately 10 per cent of Vancouver Island residents remain unvaccinated. The health authority says the unvaccinated ""are experiencing the vast majority of COVID-19 hospitalizations, critical care admissions, and deaths in critical care.""

	During a news conference on Tuesday, Saskatchewan Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab appeared to give his clearest indication yet that he has recommended additional COVID-19 measures to the government.

	Since implementing a province-wide mask mandate in September and requiring proof of vaccination or a negative test result in some settings as of Oct. 1, no further preventive measures have been introduced.

	In an Oct. 21 letter to Health Minister Paul Merriman, 21 medical health officers working in the province called for measures including a 28-day limit on private gathering sizes similar to what was in place during the early stages of Saskatchewan's reopening plan ""with some modifications for the fully immunized population.""

	Manitoba is once again expanding the eligibility for third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

	On Wednesday, the province said residents of ""congregate elderly persons housing"" are now recommended and eligible to receive the third dose.

	In a media briefing on Wednesday Dr. Joss Reimer, medical lead of Manitoba’s Vaccine Implementation Task Force, said health regions will begin work with the approximate 500 seniors’ housing facilities to make sure there are plans in place to ensure third dose vaccines are available for those who are eligible.

	Reimer said the reason for the third dose recommendation is based on immune responses in older people and the vaccine rollout.

	“Immune responses in older people can be less robust and they can wane more quickly over time,” said Reimer. “Based on age and the way we did the rollout in the spring, these were also some of the first people in Manitoba to receive their first and second dose.”

	Chambers of commerce were among the locations the Saskatchewan government announced would be distribution points for rapid test kits. The kits are offered free of charge.

	Fire halls are also among the locations that are offering the kits. However, the Saskatoon Fire Department opted out of the distribution program due to its COVID-19 protocols.

	While the tests are not as accurate as those which use the PCR method, they can serve as a first line of defence for people wanting to have an idea of their COVID-19 status.

	Results obtained through the self-administered tests can not be used as proof of a negative result under the province's COVID-19 vaccine mandate.

	Aebig said the Saskatoon chamber aims to hand out the tests between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays.

	""We're told we will be restocked regularly. We're not sure what that looks like just yet,"" Aebig said.

	Aebig said the chamber ran out of all 3,300 of their tests on Tuesday and doesn’t know when they’ll get more.

	Tests were also handed out at Warman City Hall – with their supply of 3,500 tests, they are down by about 800 so far.

	Warman Mayor Gary Philipchuk said he is glad they can help distribute the tests and give a sense of relief to some.

	Warman dad Garett Mathiason has two kids, age two and six and wanted to get the tests for his family’s peace of mind.

	Although COVID-19 cases are slightly declining in Alberta, two doctors who treat patients from rural areas say a fifth wave may be inevitable if people in those communities do not get vaccinated at a faster pace.

	Provincial data says 78.3 per cent of eligible Albertans overall, including those who are 12 and older, are fully vaccinated and 86.4 per cent have had at least one shot.

       Alberta reports 12 deaths, 442 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday

	Dr. Raman Kumar, a family doctor at Maxwell Medical in Fort McMurray, Alta., says the rural population is overrepresented in overwhelmed intensive care units “simply because of the fact that there has been more vaccine hesitancy” among them.

	“For example, here in Fort McMurray, we've had significant issues with our intensive care units being full of patients and we transport our patients to other communities,” said Kumar.

	“We had seven nurses come from Newfoundland (to Fort McMurray during the fourth wave), so COVID definitely has been a major, major problem for rural communities.”

	In High Level, one of the most northern municipalities in Alberta, 23 per cent of residents have had at least their first dose of vaccine. The number is 39 per cent in the County of Forty Mile in the south and 40 per cent in Two Hills County in east-central Alberta.

	On average, 55 per cent of Albertans living in Manning, Peace River, Fairview, Spirit River, St. Paul, and Lethbridge have had their first dose.

	“If we don't achieve higher vaccination rates in some areas, we'll be at risk of a fifth wave and sixth wave because of the ongoing transmission,” said Dr. Finola Hackett, a rural family health physician working in Pincher Creek.

	“As we've seen with the fourth wave, a low vaccination rate did not protect from COVID and the Delta variants, so there's a higher risk for sure in some rural areas.”

	Hackett and Kumar say three main factors contribute to the low vaccine intake in rural communities.

	“I call them the three Cs,” said Hackett.

	“There is complacency, convenience, and then the third one being conspiracy.”

	Hackett said complacency can be seen in some Albertans “who are especially younger” in rural communities who have told her they don't want to get a shot because they believe they are healthy. She said she tells them that the vaccine not only protects them from the virus, but also reduces the risk of transmission to others with compromised immunity.

	Convenience is a matter of accessibility.

	“The government and other partners send mobile clinics to some rural areas so that helped ... but there's still pockets of those who might have issues with (transportation).”

	The third C and most common reason why rural Albertans are not getting vaccinated is the “pandemic of misinformation,” Hackett said.

	“Sometimes ... a small, tight-knit community is sharing misinformation that spreads fast,” she said. “Certain rural areas, that tend to be more conservative, are more distrustful of any government program.”

	Hackett and Kumar said they have met several patients in rural Alberta, sometimes multiple times, and have persuaded them to get vaccinated.

	“I just don't think that acting on frustration or polarization gets us anywhere, as hard as it is finding that patience and energy to understand empathetically why someone is vaccine hesitant,” said Hackett.

	The doctors said they are helping to launch a new campaign in rural Alberta througha national multidisciplinary coalition called 19 to Zero that is working toshift public perceptions around COVID-19 behaviours and build confidence in vaccines.

	The campaign called “It's Never Too Late” includes a video shot in an Alberta hospital. It shows a person breathing heavily while being assessed and admitted into intensive care to be intubated.

	“I just want to tell Albertans, that heck, get the vaccine,” Kumar said.

	“Let's get back to normal life, and the way we can do that is by all of us getting our shot.”

	Another 591 people recovered from COVID-19 as well, according to the ministry, pushing the province's active caseload to 4,829, down from 4,966 on Monday.

	Tuesday's update once again shows the majority of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and ICU visits involve the unvaccinated. Approximately 86 per cent of ICU patients haven't received a single dose of vaccine, according to a table shared by Health Minister Adrian Dix on Twitter, including 41 of the 42 patients who are under the age of 50.

	Just under 90 per cent of eligible B.C. residents have received at least one dose of vaccine, and nearly 85 per cent have received two.

	Earlier on Tuesday, Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry confirmed the province is offering booster shots to several vulnerable groups before the end of the year, and expanding access to the broader population beginning in January.

	Officials previously decided to provide third shots to some seniors in care, whose bodies are said to have developed weaker antibody responses following vaccination, leading to a new wave of outbreaks in those settings.

	

	

	There are currently 28 active outbreaks across B.C.'s health-care system, according to the ministry, including 23 in long-term care homes and assisted living facilities.

	Henry said emerging data indicates that immunity wanes over time with the general population as well, but that a booster could offer long-lasting protection. She stressed that a third shot shouldn't be necessary for the general population during this winter respiratory season, however.

	""Most of us have good, strong protection and we don't need a booster dose right now, but come next spring it is something we should consider,"" she said.

4 Alberta doctors file lawsuit against AHS over vaccine requirement,"Oct. 26, 2021 7:21 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Opposition to the province's vaccine policies is starting to hit the courts. In an 11-page statement of claim, four Alberta doctors are suing Alberta Health Services (AHS) and its CEO, Dr. Verna Yiu over its policy of mandatory vaccinations. 

	In the lawsuit, Dr. Eric T. Payne (Calgary), Dr. Joanna J. Moser (Calgary), Dr. Gregory Keen-Wai Chan (Ponoka), and Dr. David Loewen (Grande Prairie), claim they have “suffered vilification and extreme ill-will being directed at them as 'unvaccinated' people as a result of Dr. Yiu, Premier (Jason) Kenney, and other Government of Alberta representatives making false public statements and promulgating policies which have the effect of stating that the unvaccinated are to blame for the pandemic and hospital over crowding.”

    Advertisement
    
	The suit also claims the in being placed on unpaid leave, the four are “being held up to public opprobrium, ridicule, hatred, maltreatment, discrimination, detestation, contempt, enmity, extreme ill-will, denigration, abuse, or delegitimization on the basis of their vaccine status.""

       Alberta leaves 'essential services' out of restriction exemption program Lack of worker vaccine requirement in Alberta a 'loophole,' says health law expert Almost eight in 10 support proof-of-vaccine requirement to visit public places: pollSome universities say no to proof of vaccination requirement

	Albertans will need to prove they have both jabs of a COVID-19 vaccine to go into most restaurants, movie theatres, sporting events and non-essential businesses beginning Monday, adhering to Alberta’s Restrictions Exemption Program (REP).

	Second doses must have been administered at least two weeks prior to be acceptable under the government’s new regulations.

	The REP requires any customer entering businesses it covers to show proof of vaccination or present a negative rapid antigen, rapid PCR, or lab-based PCR, at their own cost.

	Those able to present valid proof of a medical exemption may be able to bypass the requirements.

	The government presently allows a printed version of vaccinations records, a printed vaccination certificate available at the myhealthalberta website or a downloadable QR code.

	Starting Nov. 15, the QR code will become the only accepted method of proof in Alberta.

	At the same time, governments, as well as many private companies, have instituted mandatory vaccination policies.

	AHS announced Aug. 31 that all AHS staff, members of the medical and midwifery professions, as well as students and volunteers would have to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 31.  That deadline was subsequently moved to Nov. 30.

	The lawsuit claims the AHS policy is both unethical and unlawful saying, “Any medical procedure performed on a patient without their informed consent amounts to assault.""

	It adds, “To the extent that the policy seeks to coerce employees to be vaccinated against their will, without informed consent, the policy amounts to an expressed intention to engage in a conspiracy to commit assault.""

	The suit also claims the mandatory vaccination policy breaches the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, and contravenes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

	University of Calgary law professor Lorian Hardcastle says she is not surprised that lawsuits are now making their way to the courts, but doubts most of the claims will be successful.

	“The allegations around informed consent and assault are, are quite confusing, because, of course, nobody is forcing treatment on anyone. (However)  I think that the allegations around constructive dismissal, and some of the employment kinds of allegations might have a little bit more meat to them,” said Hardcastle.

	“Certainly the prevailing wisdom does seem to be that employment lawsuits around mandatory vaccines are likely to fail, and in part because of the pandemic and the compelling situation we find ourselves in, but also, in part, because courts I think, would be very reluctant to strike down a vaccine mandate, because of course, so many employers have them now.”

	Hardcastle expects to see more lawsuits regarding mandatory vaccinations of workers as the policies come in effect and some staff have their employment curtailed.

	“I think we will see some wrongful dismissal kinds of employment law cases. I think we will see complaints to human rights tribunals in various provinces around vaccine mandates. We might see some Labour Law disputes where we're talking about a unionised workforce.” said Hardcastle, who maintains it is important for the courts to weigh in on the issues in order to provide clear direction to both employers and governments.

	“If one of these cases does make it to the Supreme Court of Canada, they may not rule before the pandemic is over, but at least then we would have some helpful guidance from them on when it's appropriate to mandate vaccines when it's constitutional to mandate vaccines. But I think at least we'll get some lower level court decisions and Human Rights Tribunal decisions, which will be helpful in the in the interim.”

	In the meantime, Hardcastle notes the Alberta government has signalled it will bring in legislation protecting employers from lawsuits as a result of imposing vaccination mandates. While the legislature resumed sitting Monday that piece of legislation has not yet been tabled.

	“The legislation could address the employment law type claims, or the Labour Law type claims, it could also amend the human rights legislation to address employers drawing distinctions on the basis of vaccines, we just aren't really sure what's coming in terms of that of that legislation. But certainly, it could affect these disputes. And could itself be the subject of litigation,"" she said.

	The lawsuit, prepared on behalf of the Alberta doctors, has been submitted but as of publication Monday, has not yet been filed with the courts. As a result, no statement of defence has been submitted by AHS or Dr. Yiu.

	Leslie Echino, who owns Annabelle’s Kitchen in Calgary says the relief comes at a much-needed time. She says her sales are down roughly 80 per cent since the new stay-at-home work suggestion was delivered at the beginning of September.

	“That's basically almost unheard of, and very shocking, very scary as a business owner that's been downtown for 14 years. I lived downtown, I worked downtown, just this location has about 14 employees and we used to have 28 before the pandemic,” Echino said.

	“I was scared for the first time in 14 years that I might actually not make it, so for me personally as a downtown restaurant owner, I am beyond thankful.”

	Executive director with the Calgary Hotel Association, Sol Zia, also applauds Ottawa for helping businesses given that travel has been limited due to the pandemic.

	“We're a category that was sacrificed during the pandemic and we insisted on some sort of guarantee of future programs, so we're very happy the federal government has come through with a continuance of wage subsidy and rent subsidy for the hardest hit,” he said.

	Zia adds however that summer 2021 was a much-needed boost for the industry with the Calgary Stampede going ahead, which makes him worry some hotels may lose eligibility for the program.

	“Hotels were open, running events and festivals, but unfortunately closing down much of their operations very early in September again,” said Zia.

	“So the details will be important. It could be an impediment, we don't really know, but we're still in negotiation with the federal government.”

	Another program starting Sunday – the Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program – will provide wage and rent subsidies of up to 50 per cent to businesses that don’t fit under the tourism and hospitality industry, but can still show ‘deep and enduring losses,’ according to deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.

	The Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) also ended Saturday and will now be replaced by the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit for those whose work is directly impacted by temporary government-imposed lock downs.

	The program is available until May 7, 2022, retroactive to Oct. 24 and will provide $300 per week to eligible workers.

	Federal Employment Minister Carla Qualthrough told CTV’s Question Period that the new benefit will only apply to people who can’t work due to lockdowns in their region and it won’t apply where there are only capacity restrictions for businesses.

	“The premise is, that workers unable to work due to a local lockdown anytime between Oct. 24 and May 7, will be eligible to get this $300 per week payment,” she said.

	“It will be driven by how a province or a region characterizes the lockdown, if they declare a complete lockdown.”

	Qualthrough adds that people who are out of work or losing income because of a refusal to adhere to a vaccine mandate would also not qualify for support.

	As of Oct. 10, the federal government had paid out $27 billion to more than two million unique CRB applicants.

	GOVERNMENT SET THE BAR TOO HIGH: CFIB

	The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) is pleased with the extension of benefits, but there are further concerns that the government has set the bar too high to obtain support.

	“We’re quite concerned that arts recreation and those kinds of event-based industries may not be eligible for that tourism, hospitality funding stream when they've also been severely impacted,” said Alberta CFIB director Annie Dormuth.

	“It's important to recognize that according to our own calculations in Alberta, arts, recreation and fitness businesses were only completely close to in person services 50 less days than restaurants.”

	Dormuth adds that the CFIB is calling on the federal government to broaden the definitions of ‘hard-hit’ businesses and lower the revenue loss threshold to 30 per access for the new relief programs.

	She also notes that new businesses that have opened up during the pandemic should also still be eligible for support.

	“New businesses have been unable to access any of the federal support programs throughout the entire pandemic and unfortunately that appears to be the same case here again. That's one of our strong recommendations to the federal government, as well as even looking at making some changes to the Canadian emergency business account loan because small businesses have accumulated a lot of COVID-19 related debt.”

	CEO and president of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce Deborah Yeldin agrees that the support comes at an important time for local businesses, although owners have limited time to adjust.

	She says it was unfair for Ottawa to announce changes on a Thursday that come into effect on a Sunday will lead to businesses scrambling to ensure they meet the new qualifications and can properly apply.

	“Businesses need advance notice and a more gradual phase out of support programs to plan and prepare for significant changes to government supports,” Yedlin said.

	“At the same time, the Calgary Chamber of Commerce is pleased to see targeted supports for businesses that continue to need assistance and a clear plan to phasing out pandemic relief measures altogether in spring 2022.”

	“I want to send heartfelt condolences to those who are grieving the loss of their loved one,” added Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “I encourage all New Brunswickers to do their part to put our province in a better position to fight this virus.”

	The province has reported 35 COVID-19 related deaths since Friday, Oct. 8.

	40 NEW CASES SATURDAY

	Health officials in New Brunswick are also reporting 40 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, along with 81 recoveries, as the total number of active cases in the province drops to 689.

	According to health officials, 21 of Saturday's 40 new cases, or 52.5 per cent, are unvaccinated. Five cases, or 12.5 per cent, are partially vaccinated, and 14 cases, or 35 per cent, are fully vaccinated.

	The province says there are currently 43 people in hospital in New Brunswick due to COVID-19, with 13 in an intensive care unit. Of those currently in hospital, 22 are unvaccinated, two are partially vaccinated, and 19 are fully vaccinated.

	Of the 13 people in the ICU, none are fully vaccinated, 12 are unvaccinated, and one is partially vaccinated.

	""What we are seeing now, is basically a surge in the number of cases, and I think it has to do with loosening of restrictions in the summer, probably after July,” says Dr. Zahid Butt an infectious disease epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Waterloo's School of Public Health Sciences.

	Although there are circuit-breakers in effect for different parts of the province, Dr. Butt believes a circuit breaker should be extended to all of New Brunswick to slow the fourth wave.

	""This is the Delta variant, so the Delta variant is highly transmissable so you'd have to go one step ahead of the virus,"" says Butt. ""You cannot wait to see another region turning into a hotspot before you implement another circuit breaker lockdown.""

	Meanwhile, New Brunswick’s opposition leader is calling for more resources from the province to go towards better control at our borders.

	""Right now there's no control points, and for me, that's a serious concern,"" says Roger Melanson, leader of New Brunswick’s Liberal opposition. ""People who do enter New Brunswick need to register online and need to prove online through their registration that they're double vaxxed, but there's no checkpoints - people can come in anyway, doubly vaxxed or not.""

AHS extending mandatory vaccine deadline as immunization rate hovers at 94 per cent,"Oct. 23, 2021 9:45 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	Alberta Health Services is giving employees “every opportunity” to get vaccinated against COVID-19, including extending the deadline by which they need to prove full immunization in order to keep working.

	AHS on Friday pushed the initial Oct. 31 deadline back to Nov. 30.

    Advertisement
    
	Officials at the agency said they ""stand by"" AHS' mandatory vaccine policy and promised it would be fully implemented, but that the change in due date was to give both employees and facility operators more time.

	""We are also seeing some challenges with contracted providers, including a number of continuing care sites, particularly those in rural areas where the immunization uptake has been low,” AHS president and CEO Dr. Verna Yiu said.

	""I think it just mirrors the immunization rates that we see in the province and how it is disproportionately higher in certain areas versus others.”

	She said the challenges are being felt across the province outside Alberta's largest cities. 

	Operators asked AHS for more time to prepare contingency plans. 

	“For example, they may not bring in new admissions, as an example, to try to keep the numbers lower. They may look at essential services, what’s essential for that site,"" Yiu said of options operators could consider if faced with staff shortages. 

	As of Friday, 94 per cent of all workers across AHS were vaccinated. That included 94 per cent of physicians, 97 per cent of ICU staff, and 76 per cent of casual employees who had submitted proof of full immunization. 

	A total of 61 employees had quit over the vaccine mandate, including 11 registered nurses and 20 in other clinical roles.

	AHS also had more than 1,400 medical or religious exemption requests to review before the deadline, but Yiu said the agency was setting the bar ""pretty high.""

	She told reporters she was confident the extra time would see more staff sign up for COVID-19 vaccine. 

	Leaders have been directed to meet with employees who either are vaccine hesitant or who have not submitted proof of vaccination. 

	“These individual conversations are really important, offers to speak to experts, we’ve got resources in place to not just help our managers in the conversation but also educational tools that people can take a look at, and we’re including peer discussions in this because we think it’s important to not just have it come from a leader, but also as colleagues,” AHS' CEO said. 

	Those who do not have an exemption approved and refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine could be placed on an unpaid leave of absence until they get vaccinated. 

	Yiu said there's ""always been a risk"" of further straining the health-care system if employees quit, but that the high number of staff already vaccinated would help. 

	""I think we have enough staff on right now that we can absorb that and we’re pretty confident, at least from an acute care perspective, that we’ve got enough immunized to be able to offset those who are still waiting to make the decision.”

	She added the potential is exacerbated by Alberta's rate of staff vacancy, which moves between 10 and 30 per cent. 

	The vaccine mandate, announced at the beginning of September, applies to all AHS, Alberta Precision Labs, Carewest, CapitalCare and Covenant Health employees, members of the medical and midwifery staffs, students, and volunteers. 

	Workers who get vaccinated after Nov. 30 will be able to return to work when they provide proof of full vaccination. 

	AHS said it was not pursuing terminations for non-compliant staff at the time.

'A bit difficult to explain': Business owners question COVID-19 rules limiting dancing as other restrictions lift,"Oct. 22, 2021 4:43 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	While capacity limits on many indoor venues in parts of B.C. will ease next week, dancing is still prohibited, which some owners say will continue to hurt their business.

	B.C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, says dancing at nightclubs and at indoor weddings still isn't allowed, even though other restrictions at venues are lifting on Tuesday.

	""I know it's going to be hardest, particularly, for nightclubs and some of the bars where this is an important part of the atmosphere,"" Henry said during her weekly COVID-19 update.

	Members of the industry, however, are hoping the province will reconsider that rule.

	""It's a bit difficult to explain to folks why you can have a concert with 10,000 people where everyone's congregating together or a hockey game and yet I can't with 100 people in a nightclub,"" said Jeff Guignard of the BC Alliance of Beverage Licensees.

	""But it's a gradual, phased reopening and I've often said there's no point in looking for logic in some of these rules, we're all just doing the best we can … our commitment will be to keep dance floors closed and do our best to manage our patron behaviours.""

	Business owners have also raised questions about enforcement, like what exactly is considered dancing and whether people can dance at their individual tables.

	Dave Kershaw, owner of the Cabana Lounge, said the rules are costing his business tens of thousands of dollars.

	""People have, in the last few weeks, really started to cancel their reservations because they felt they went and got vaccinated to have a proper experience at a nightclub,"" Kershaw said.

	Henry said she hopes people, especially those who have their vaccine card, will continue to support local businesses.

	""We are absolutely continuing to monitor,"" Henry said on Tuesday. ""I hope to be able to take off more restrictions as we get through the next few months, but it's going to be a challenge for all of us.""

Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries to implement COVID-19 vaccine policy,"Oct. 22, 2021 4:03 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries will be implementing a COVID-19 vaccine policy at the start of next year.

	According to a spokesperson for the Crown corporation, employees will have to choose to voluntarily provide proof of full vaccination or take part in rapid testing.

    Advertisement
    
	This policy will come into effect on Jan. 10, 2022, and includes all employees working or attending Manitoba Liquor and Lottery locations, as well as employees who attend partner sites.

	Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries is a Crown corporation of the Province of Manitoba, which announced its own vaccine policy earlier in the year.

	At the end of August, the Manitoba government announced that certain designated provincial employees would be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo regular testing. These designated workers include direct health-care providers, educational and child-care workers, and public servants who work in high-risk settings with direct contact with the public.

	While the campaign could start as soon as the beginning of December, Mackie said that date could fluctuate from a couple of weeks up to a month.

	For those who have already been vaccinated, the process is expected to be much the same, Mackie said.

	""The plan is fairly similar to the first few waves, so we will have large mass vaccination clinics open at the Agriplex and Mount Brydges out in the Strathroy-Caradoc area. We will have pharmacy partners, lining up to make sure that they can offer vaccine as well.""

	The mass vaccination clinics, which are currently accepting all walk-ins, will move back to an appointment-based system to manage volume, Mackie explained.

	""It won't be possible to have everybody show up on day one, as soon as everyone I'm sure would want. So we'll have to spread those out, so people will use the covidvaccinelm.ca website to book their appointments.""

	It's expected to take two to three weeks to get all the newly eligible kids their first dose, and the same for second doses a month later.

	After the initial rollout, Mackie says there will be ""catch up campaigns out of the mobile clinics, school clinics and that sort of thing, to make sure that for those for whom access is an issue, we can reduce barriers as much as possible.""

	Primary care providers like family doctors are not expected to play as active a role in this rollout.

	Higgs said his government has faced a lot of questions since easing COVID-19 restrictions in the province at the end of July.

	""Did we underestimate the Delta variant? Did we ease restrictions too soon? Were we overly confident that more New Brunswickers would get vaccinated? I know that many of you are frustrated and in some cases angry that we are still living with COVID,"" Higgs said. ""I understand this because I, too, feel the same way.""

	When restrictions were lifted on July 31, New Brunswick had reported 46 deaths related to the virus. During the last two-and-a-half months, that number has more than doubled.

	""I take responsibility for everything, everywhere that relates to the citizens of the province,"" said Higgs. ""I obviously deeply regret the situation we're in right now.""

	CIRCUIT BREAKER EXTENDED

	Higgs said while the number of new and active cases have moved in the right direction since the province implemented ""circuit breaker"" measures on Oct. 8, the numbers are still too high.

	""That is why on the advice of public health and the cabinet COVID-19 committee, we've decided to extend circuit breaker measure for at least seven days,"" Higgs said. ""The Delta variant is different than anything we've experienced so far, that is why we need to treat it differently.""

	The areas affected are Zone 1 (Moncton region) as far north as and including Sainte-Anne-de-Kent and including Havelock in Zone 2; the northern portion of Zone 3 from and including Deerville and Florenceville-Bristol, but excluding Hayesville and Parker Ridge; and all of Zone 4 (Edmundston region).

	""We have seen encouraging data since the circuit breaker measures went into effect, but it is still too early to know if cases in the affected areas will continue to steadily decline in the days ahead,” Dr. Jennifer Russell, the province's chief medical officer of health said. “If we were to remove these measures now, without knowing for certain that we are experiencing a sustained downward trend in cases and hospitalizations, we could prolong the situation even further.”

	Russell said in a news release that the measures will be lifted when public health can confirm ""a sustained trend of decreasing numbers of cases and a decline in the seven-day average of new hospital admissions.""

	14-DAY CIRCUIT BREAKER IN ZONE 5 STARTS FRIDAY

	New Brunswick Public Health also announced that Zone 5 (the Campbellton region) will enter a 14-day circuit breaker starting Friday at 6 p.m. to bring the high number of COVID-19 transmissions in the region under control.

	""I know this news is difficult for those living in Zone 5 and for those in the current circuit breaker areas, as you have worked hard,"" Higgs said in a news release. ""The numbers are slowly getting better, but the Delta variant is different from anything we have experienced before, and we need to treat it differently.""

	You can find more information online about the circuit breaker rules and the areas it covers, including maps.





	67 NEW CASES CONFIRMED, ALONG WITH 63 RECOVERIES

	Public Health reported 67 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday along with 63 recoveries, raising the number of active cases in New Brunswick to 763.

	Of the new cases, 38 – or 57 per cent – are unvaccinated, four – or six per cent – are partially vaccinated, and 25 – or 37 per cent – are fully vaccinated, public health said in a news release.

	HIGGS ALLUDES TO MISTAKES, BUT DEFENDS PUBLIC HEALTH

	On Thursday afternoon, Higgs alluded to mistakes made along the way. When asked about them in an interview with CTV Atlantic later in the day, Higgs elaborated.

	""We thought that 75 per cent vaccination rate would give us herd immunity and we'd be good,"" Higgs told CTV Atlantic in an interview. ""I mean there were points where we thought 70 per cent was going to do that just fine back in early July, and now we're saying no, that's not the case at all. It's 90 per cent, so you know, we need to learn through this entire pandemic of what needs to be done differently.""

	Higgs also pointed out the onslaught of criticism he and the public health team in New Brunswick has not gone unnoticed.

	""One of the things that I underestimated, is that how quickly people really turn on you,"" Higgs said. ""You know, because, because everyone has worked so hard, not just me, I mean I'm just one of a team of many people that have worked tirelessly and through this and done very well, whether it's at borders, whether it's testing, whatever. So, so, yeah, we have a hard spot here right now but I'll stick with the team, we'll get through this.""

	MAJORITY OF PATIENTS IN ICU WITH COVID-19 ARE UNVACCINATED

	Public health says there are 55 people hospitalized because of the novel coronavirus. Of those, 27 are unvaccinated, five are partially vaccinated and 23 are fully vaccinated. There are 16 people in an intensive care unit, with 14 unvaccinated and two partially vaccinated.

	""Many of the 23 people who are fully vaccinated who are currently in the hospital did not have COVID-19 when they were admitted,"" public health said in a news release. ""They contracted the virus while hospitalized for other reasons due to the ongoing outbreaks at the Moncton Hospital and the Campbellton Regional Hospital.""

	Russell said these fully vaccinated patients are ""generally experiencing mild symptoms.""

	NEW RULES FOR POSITIVE RAPID-TEST RESULTS

	The province's emergency order has been updated to require anyone who gets a positive result from a rapid-test kit at home to immediately schedule an appointment for a lab-based PCR test at a public health assessment centre.

	You can book an appointment online or by calling 811.

	""Anyone who fails to do so will be subject to fines,"" public health said in a news release. ""Peace officers will investigate information received through employer testing programs and from residents to ensure individuals are complying.""

	RAPID-TEST KITS AVAILABLE FOR PICKUP

	Public health has made free rapid COVID-19 screening tests available for those who have not tested positive for COVID-19.

	The tests are designed for people two and older and most have five tests to be used over a 10-day period. People 16 and under must be accompanied by an adult to acquire a kit.

	On Wednesday, the province distributed 7,333 rapid-test kits.

	A full list of locations is available online for both Vitalité and Horizon health networks. More information on the rapid-test kits program is available online.

	VACCINATION UPDATE

	Public Health reported Thursday that 83.1 per cent of eligible New Brunswickers are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and 91.9 per cent have received their first dose of a vaccine.

	If you have not yet had your first or second dose, you can go to a walk-in clinic or book an appointment through a participating pharmacy or at a Vitalité or Horizon health network clinic.

	All eligible New Brunswickers can book a second-dose appointment for a date that is at least 28 days after the first dose.

	A list of upcoming mobile and walk-in clinics is available online.

	Health-care workers – including those working in long-term care facilities – and residents of First Nations communities can get an mRNA COVID-19 booster starting Oct. 25.

	To get the booster dose, six months must have passed since the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

	CONFIRMED CASES IN SCHOOLS AND CHILD-CARE FACILITIES

Kulbaba's post prompted an outpouring of sympathy, with many of his thousands of followers offering non-medical advice for treating his symptoms, recommending remedies ranging from melatonin to vitamin C. Some also suggested he take the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, which has not been proven to treat COVID-19.  ""Ivermectin for horses comes in a paste. Take one-tenth of a tube a day,"" one commenter wrote, possibly in jest.  ""Thanks for dose info,"" responded another.  Ivermectin prompted a warning from Health Canada over the summer following a spike in poison control centre calls regarding people who had taken the drug against medical advice.  ""There is no evidence that ivermectin works to prevent or treat COVID-19, and it is not authorized for this use,"" Health Canada said at the time.  ""Health Canada has not received any drug submission or applications for clinical trials for ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.""

	""Three of the four in the intensive care unit were fully immunized,"" said Dr. Charles Gardner during a COVID-19 update on Wednesday.

	The region's top doctor noted that 39 per cent of cases in the past week were ""breakthrough cases,"" meaning fully vaccinated individuals.

	Still, he said this isn't unexpected.

	""The proportion of our cases that are breakthrough cases will go up over time. That does not change the degree of protection for people who received immunization,"" Gardner said.

	The medical officer added that the vaccine offers a ""high degree of protection"" against COVID-19.

	""In fact, if you're not immunized, you're 10 times more likely to become a case and 23 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital,"" Gardner said.

	He mentioned the rise in vaccinated patients or cases is due to the widespread vaccination coverage for the region's population.

	""We expect it to increase over time because it is partly a function of how complete our vaccination coverage is for the population,"" he noted.

	Despite the rise in vaccinated cases, local case counts have fallen in five of the past six weeks.

	However, Gardner said it's still too early to know what, if any, impact Thanksgiving get-togethers will have on infection rates.

	This time last year, cases surged 15 per cent.

STF calls for tighter measures in schools as fourth wave continues in Sask.,"Oct. 21, 2021 7:01 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	The Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation [STF] is calling for the province to take more action to address COVID-19 transmission in schools.

	STF president Patrick Maze said Wednesday the organization is aware of cases where those exposed to COVID-19 in a classroom were not aware of the exposure until near the end of their isolation period.

    Advertisement
    
	“Unfortunately when people are finding out 10 or 15 days after they’ve been exposed that they need to isolate but there’s only a day or two left or no time left in the requirement, that just allows COVID to spread further in our schools,” Maze said.
        RELATED STORIES

	Other issues include breakthrough cases in vaccinated staff and difficulties in finding substitute teachers.

	The STF also called for the return of the Education Sector Response Planning Team that helped determine COVID-19 measures in schools,saying the direct line of communication it provided between the team, government and health officials was critical for pandemic planning last year.

	""We need to make a decision. Do we want to end COVID or do we want to keep schools open at all costs?"" Maze said.

	During a provincial update Wednesday morning, chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said some increase in transmission within school settings was “expected” given that children 11 and under continue to be the largest demographic of unvaccinated people.

	According to Shahab, 23 per cent of cases under 11 are connected to school settings, but many continue to come from the household, especially when others in the home are also unvaccinated.

	“We aren’t seeing large outbreaks, we’re seeing clusters of two or three cases in class,” Shahab said. “We’re watching that closely.”

	Shahab also reaffirmed schools reflect the level of community transmission.

	""Compared to last year less schools are going online, there’s less disruption, children are able to do a lot of activities in school including sports,"" Shahab said.

	“The information that has been shared with me is that schools are still relatively safe when it comes to the transmission of COVID-19,” Education Minister Dustin Duncan said. “We certainly are still trying to encourage as many people, including students who are eligible, to get vaccinated.”

	Health Canada is currently reviewing approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children under 12.

	Most teenagers have been eligible since May, and have embraced the shot for the most part.

	""The youth are putting our young adults to shame by having a higher vaccination rate. I’ve always said we should learn from our seniors, but we should also learn from our 12-17 year olds on how to get vaccinated,"" Shahab said.

B.C. Children's Hospital ER seeing increase in number of patients with respiratory viruses ,"Oct. 21, 2021 10:22 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	An “unusually high” number of patients with respiratory viruses have been showing up over the past month at the B.C. Children's Hospital emergency department, according to the hospital.

	General pediatrician Dr. Claire Seaton said nearly 30 per cent of all emergency department visits from mid-September to mid-October were for respiratory-related illnesses, up nearly 10 per cent from before the pandemic.

    Advertisement
    
	""Looking at data from before COVID, we’re probably seeing around 300 more children in the last month than we did two years ago,"" she said. ""Of course, during COVID and last season, we really didn’t see any of these winter viruses at all.""

	 The hospital said it’s seeing more cases involving respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza, and earlier than usual.

	RSV is one of the common cold viruses, and usually causes mild illness or bronchiolitis in young infants. Symptoms can be more severe in babies under six months old, especially those who were born premature or have chronic heart or lung conditions. The hospital said B.C. did not see any reported cases of RSV last winter.

	""So we are expecting a higher rate, and earlier rates of RSV infection, and we think that’s just starting to happen here,"" Dr. Seaton said. ""It’s already happened in other places around the world. For example in Quebec, they’re busy with hospitalizations for those conditions and we’re getting prepared for it to happen here.""

	Parainfluenza is an infection that can cause symptoms ranging from a mild cold, to more severe illnesses including croup and pneumonia. It can also trigger asthma in children.

	B.C. Children’s Hospital said the emergency department has also been testing a high number of children for COVID-19, on about 30 per cent of ER visits, which may correlate with visits for respiratory illness. Of more than 1,200 tests processed through the emergency department over the last month, less than two per cent came back positive, and there were no hospitalizations.

	""COVID is definitely what we’re all talking about,"" Dr. Seaton said. ""But right now it’s all these other respiratory viruses that are important, and are probably going to put our kids more likely into a hospital bed or into the emergency department than COVID itself.""

	Often, RSV goes away on its own and can be treated at home. Young babies and those born prematurely sometimes need treatment in hospital. B.C. Children’s is asking families to keep an eye on their children’s symptoms, and head to the emergency department if they notice difficulty breathing, grunting sounds, breathing really hard, or if the child is turning pale or blue.

	The hospital is also reminding parents the safety measures associated with COVID-19 can also help protect children from other viruses, including staying home when sick, washing hands, and following mask mandates.

	On Tuesday, B.C. also made flu shots free for all who are eligible, in the hopes of encouraging more vaccination to reduce strain on the health-care system.

	Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre medical director Dr. Brian Conway said the return of influenza is a concern, in part due to the lack of community immunity from last year.

	""Instead of several thousand cases last year, we had 18 or 19,"" he said. ""We base this year’s vaccine on last year’s flu season. There was no flu season. This year’s vaccine is an educated guess...and finally, we do not know what combined infection with influenza and COVID looks like.""

	Dr. Conway said increased interactions are likely also behind the resurgence of other respiratory viruses this year.

	""Last year at this time, we were interacting with each other at a rate that was 40 per cent of the pre-covid normal,"" he said. ""Now we’re at 80 to 90 per cent.""

	Flu shots have already been rolling out this week in the province. London Drugs pharmacy division general manager Chris Chiew said the initial response has already been strong.

	""We’ve been booked up solid for all of this week, and all of next week as well,"" he said, and added there will be more supply provided to pharmacies this year following record demand last year. ""We just ask everybody be patient for the first couple of weeks, you will definitely get your shot.""

	Dr. Seaton said along with the influenza vaccine, routine childhood immunizations are also important, including pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccines, which can prevent complications of viral infections.

	""Antibiotics don’t treat these viral infections, the vast majority just need a bit of tender loving care at home,"" she said. ""Fluids, keeping your child comfortable, looking out for those severe signs of illness and knowing when to come into the emergency department.""

	The Boston-based conglomerate is the latest U.S. employer to impose such a requirement, which has sparked a political fight.

	While supporters of vaccine mandates see them as necessary to pull the country out of the nearly two-year-old pandemic, critics are calling them unconstitutional and authoritarian.

	The White House has said vaccine requirements have driven up COVID-19 vaccination rates by 20 percentage points.

	The measure has drawn a sharp reaction from some Republicans, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott last week barring COVID-19 vaccine mandates by any entity, including private employers.

	Union Pacific Corp and its three unions have sued each other over the vaccine mandate.

     Vancouver - 
     
    
	With just one week to go before B.C.'s broader COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health-care workers comes into effect, about 5,500 employees have yet to receive their first dose.

	Health Minister Adrian Dix said that number doesn't include unvaccinated workers from long-term care homes and assisted living facilities, who were forced from their jobs on Oct. 12 when the province imposed its mandate in those settings.

	The 5,512 workers from hospitals and other health-care settings who remain unvaccinated – and who represent four percent of the 129,924 employees facing the expanded mandate – have until Oct. 26 to get their first dose to avoid facing the same consequences.

	""We're hopeful, of course, that people will move to get vaccinated and comply with the upcoming order,"" Dix said.

	According to the public health order implementing the mandate, employees who only have one dose can continue working as long as they take certain precautions, and get their second dose between 28 and 35 days after their first.

	Workers who fail to meet the Oct. 26 deadline will have until Nov. 15 to get their first dose, and won't be able to return to their jobs until seven days after the shot. They also have to get their second within 35 days.

	A full 93 per cent of health-care workers employed outside of the long-term care and assisted living system – or 121,048 people – are already fully vaccinated, and another three per cent have had their first shot.

	""Essentially what we're seeing with the 96 per cent mark is a very similar number to what we saw in assisted living and in long-term care,"" Dix noted.

	On Wednesday, the health minister said the province is working with hospitals and facilities to mitigate potential staffing shortages created by the mandate. He also pointed out that COVID-19 outbreaks can be disruptive to staffing levels.

	""When people are off sick from COVID-19 or as contacts of COVID-19, it affects staffing in hospitals as well and continues to do so. So this measure is necessary,"" he said.

	Dr. Bonnie Henry and Dix have both acknowledged that health-care staff are stressed, and in many cases, stretched to the limits.

	Dozens of patients from Northern Health have had to be airlifted to other parts of the province as cases and hospitalizations soar in that region. Experts blame the low levels of immunization in the north.

	According to officials, the region with the highest number of unvaccinated health-care workers is Interior Health (seven per cent), followed by Northern Health (six per cent) and Island Health (five per cent).

	The mandate doesn't apply to the First Nations Health Authority.

	When the vaccine mandate for long-term care and assisted living took effect last week, 1,955 of the 48,879 affected workers across B.C. were unvaccinated, including a number of casual employees.

	If they decide to get vaccinated, they are also welcome to return to work under similar conditions.

	Long-term care homes and assisted living facilities were the first subjected to the mandate because of the deadly consequences seen this year during the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks, blamed in part on the highly contagious Delta variant.

	Officials have noted the bodies of vulnerable seniors and others in care are sometimes less capable of mounting a strong antibody response after vaccination.

	""We know these are settings where transmission causes strain on the system if health-care workers are infected, but also can mean transmission to those who are most vulnerable to severe illness,"" Henry said last week.

	""Few know better than those working in long-term care and assisted living what the impact of COVID-19 has been on our seniors and elders,"" Henry said last week.

	All that meant getting the family tested multiple times.

	Her children, who are five and eight years old, both attend Dartmouth South Academy, which is one of three Nova Scotia schools closed most recently due to mounting COVID-19 exposure warnings.

	The last-minute notice means it's been a scramble for parents juggling work and home.

	""And I think we're all tired and our nerves are frayed,"" says Foster.

	She also feels somewhat fortunate, however, because both she and her husband can work from home. But Foster worries about families who don't have that option when a school suddenly closes.

	""I think a lot about people who don't have that luxury, and if they take a day off they don't get paid,"" says Foster, ""I just don't know how people are doing it.""

	Foster also worries about the fact that she and her husband are vaccinated, while her children are too young.

	It's just one example of the pressure parents are under while trying to keep their children safe and healthy in the ongoing pandemic.

	It's something parent Alva Bourque relates to all too well. Both she and her husband are essential workers, which also means plenty of precautions and testing both inside and outside the home.

	""It is challenging, very, very challenging,"" says Bourque during her lunch break in Halifax.

	With a child in Grade 2, and the other in daycare, Bourque says her family is constantly vigilant about masking, physical distancing, and hand washing.

	She has also been driving her daughter to school instead of using the school bus, to try to cut down on potential close contacts.

	""Both my husband and I are double-vaccinated,"" says Bourque, ""so I feel like we are protecting our children who cannot have the vaccine for now.""

	That's one thing parents like Bourque and Foster hope will change soon, now that Pfizer has officially asked Health Canada to approve its COVID-19 vaccine for children between five and 11 years old.

	""We'll feel a lot better knowing we all have some protection against the virus,"" says Foster.

	""Can it be tomorrow?"" laughs Bourque.

	Health Canada says it will only authorize the Pfizer vaccine if the benefits outweigh any potential health risks for that age group.

	Then, the vaccine must be reviewed by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization.

	After that, it's up to the provinces to determine how to deliver it as quickly as possible.

	""Once we get through those two steps, the vaccine team is already working in detail planning that,"" Dr. Robert Strang explained in Nova Scotia's COVID-19 update Tuesday morning.

	Until all those steps are completed, families like the Fosters and the Bourques will forge ahead as best they can, handling whatever else comes next in the pandemic.

U.S. businesses nervously await fine print of vax-or-test rule,"Oct. 20, 2021 8:36 a.m. CST","
     
     WASHINGTON - 
     
    
	More than six weeks after promising a new vaccination-or-testing rule covering the millions of Americans at companies with 100 or more workers, U.S. President Joe Biden's most aggressive move yet to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is almost ready to see the light of day.

	An obscure White House office is expected to give the green light any day to the rule's fine print detailing how and when companies will have to require their employees to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing.

    Advertisement
    
	The full enforcement deadline, which could carry penalties of about $14,000 per violation, may not take effect until after the new year. That's why Biden and his aides have for weeks encouraged businesses to act as though the rule was already in effect and start imposing vaccination requirements.

	The regulation, to be published in the Federal Register, was drafted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under emergency authorities to protect worker safety and will cover an estimated 80 million U.S. workers. The White House sees it as a potent tool to winnow down the ranks of roughly 65 million Americans who have thus far refused to get a shot.

	Unlike healthcare providers or federal employees, who may not have a testing alternative to vaccination, private sector workers won't necessarily face termination if they don't get vaccinated. But some businesses may choose to impose their own more stringent vaccination mandate, and it's possible that businesses may be allowed to pass on the cost of weekly COVID-19 testing to their unvaccinated employees.

	White House officials declined to discuss when the rule will be published or go into details on when businesses will have to comply.

	For the last week, federal officials have hosted more than two dozen listening sessions with industry groups, businesses and advocacy organizations. Some have been supportive of the rule, others vehemently opposed, but all are eager to learn more about the fine print of the regulation.

	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups that represent large employers are worried that the proposal's threshold --- applying to companies with 100 or more employees -- could cause workers to migrate to jobs at smaller employers where they won't need to be vaccinated.

	""We really stressed the concern about employers losing employees, and what that would mean in the context of current supply-chain challenges and the upcoming holiday season,"" said Marc Freedman, vice president for employment policy at the Chamber of Commerce. ""You could start to see some very serious disruptions.""

	Freedman, who took part in the chamber's call with administration officials, said the 100-worker threshold would also hurt job creation by giving employers who have 90 or 95 employees a reason not to expand.

	The experience of United Airlines and health-care providers that acted early to require vaccination suggests that very few employees will give up their jobs because of a vaccine mandate. United says about 200 of its 67,000 U.S. workers face termination for refusing to get vaccinated and another 2,000 are still seeking medical or religious exemptions.

	State government vaccination mandate deadlines went into effect this week in Washington state, Massachusetts and New Jersey after a host of legal challenges by state employees and first responders' unions.

	In Washington, the state patrol lost 127 employees, including 67 troopers, who left due to the COVID-19 vaccination mandate for state employees, about 6% of the agency's staff, officials said.

	The Northwest state's mandate also led to the high-profile firing of Washington State football coach Nick Rolovich and his four assistants, who wouldn't get vaccinated.

	In Massachusetts, nearly 1,600 state employees had not proved they were vaccinated or had sought a vaccine exemption by a Sunday deadline. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker announced in August that some 44,000 executive branch workers and contractors would be required to get vaccinated or face suspension and ultimately the loss of their jobs.

	The National Association of Manufacturers is arguing that companies should get credit -- perhaps an exemption from the rules -- for taking early steps to get a high percentage of workers vaccinated. Manufacturers have expressed worry that they could see higher quit rates because many plants are located in rural areas where opposition to vaccination is stronger.

	The manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups are also pushing the administration to let employers make unvaccinated workers pay for their own weekly COVID-19 testing.

	""A lot of our members feel strongly that the vaccine is widely available, it is free, and so if a person opts not to be vaccinated potentially the onus of the test can and should fall on the employee who has made a choice not to vaccinate,"" said Robyn Boerstling, a NAM vice president. She said employers should pay for testing if an employee has a medical condition or a ""proven and true"" religious reason for seeking an exemption.

	Business groups, however, are not optimistic on the test-cost issue, saying that OSHA has a history of making employers bear the cost of new regulations.

	Retailers are worried about the timing of the new regulation taking effect as they prepare for the critical holiday season. They want to push the rule's effective date into next year.

	Several people who took part in the discussions with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is doing the final review of the proposal, said they got no hints whether their arguments would sway the administration. They described conference-call meetings --- virtual because of the pandemic --- in which White House staffers listened and did not respond to their arguments.

	It is not clear how the business community will respond once the final rule is published.

	Business officials said legal challenges are more likely to come from Republican-led states such as Texas. And Alfredo Ortiz, president and CEO of the conservative Job Creators Network, reiterated his pledge Tuesday after meeting with the White House officials to sue to block the rule's implementation. Two dozen attorneys general in GOP states vowed last month to use ""every available legal option"" to kill the mandate.

Restaurants will need subsidies to survive winter says industry group,"Oct. 19, 2021 9:02 p.m. CST","
     
     Sault Ste. Marie - 
     
    
	A foodservice industry group is calling for a continuation of wage and rent subsidy programs as restaurants look to rebound from COVID-19 restrictions. Restaurants Canada said eight out of 10 establishments across the country will need help getting through the fall and winter seasons.

	Rebecca Sawyer, manager of Shooters Downstairs Lounge in Sault Ste. Marie, said government subsidies have helped them keep the doors open and their staff employed.

	""Without the wage subsidy program and a number of little supports that we've been able to kind of get our hands into, there's a good chance that we wouldn't even be open right now,"" Sawyer said. ""I do believe that the wage subsidy program going into the new year is almost going to be absolutely necessary, if not closer to the spring.""  Find more Sault area news here

	James Rilett, a vice-president of Restaurants Canada, said the industry in Ontario continues to struggle and that wage and rent subsidies must continue. He said many establishments have taken on a lot of debt over the last 19 months.

	""They're now having to service that debt or pay back bills that had just been put on hold,"" Rilett said. ""So all that is coming due and it just makes profitability in the restaurant sector a delayed thing right now.""

	The industry saw a rebound in the summer, he said, but with patios closing for the season and the vaccine passport system in place, restaurants are once again seeing a drop in sales.

	""When the vaccine passport was brought in, about 60 per cent reported decreased revenue, and 40 per cent say it was significant,"" Rilett said.

	Sawyer agrees, saying the passport system has had an impact on her business.

	""Despite how soon we saw it coming, it's nothing you can really, truly prepare for,"" she said. ""We're dependent on the public to decide that this is what they are willing to participate with and still come out and support restaurants, bars, and the industry as a whole.""

	Even after all public health restrictions come down, Rilett estimates it will take up to 18 months for the industry to fully recover. Sawyer contends it will take even longer given the pandemic's impact on the economy as a whole.

Washington State coach Nick Rolovich fired for refusing COVID-19 vaccine,"Oct. 19, 2021 8:54 p.m. CST","
     
     SPOKANE, Wash. - 
     
    
	Washington State fired football coach Nick Rolovich and four of his assistants on Monday for refusing a state mandate that all employees get vaccinated against COVID-19, making him the first major college coach to lose his job over vaccination status.

	Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, had set a deadline of Monday for thousands of state employees, including the Cougars' coach, to be vaccinated. Rolovich applied for a religious exemption, which was denied Monday, Washington State athletic director Pat Chun said.

	""This is a tough day for Washington State football,"" Chun said at a news conference. ""Nobody wants to be here.""

	Also fired for refusing vaccination were assistant coaches Ricky Logo, John Richardson, Craig Stutzmann and Mark Weber. Chun said there may be no precedent for a team losing its head coach and so many assistants in the middle of a season.

	""Our student-athletes are the biggest losers in this,"" he said.

	Rolovich was not immediately available for comment.

	The 42-year-old Rolovich was the highest-paid state employee with an annual salary of more than US$3 million in a contract that runs through 2025. He had said he wouldn't get vaccinated but wouldn't specify his reasons. He was the only unvaccinated head coach in the Pac-12 and had worn a mask during games.

	Rolovich was fired for cause, which means the university does not have to honour the rest of his contract, although lawsuits over the decision are likely. The Washington State athletic department is currently facing a shortfall of more than $30 million.

	Around the country, many college football coaches have publicly advocated for vaccination, including Clemson's Dabo Swinney and Alabama's Nick Saban. Mississippi coach Lane Kiffin said not getting vaccinated would be irresponsible and bragged about his team being 100% vaccinated.

	Many coaches have talked about their teams' high vaccination rates, though schools are not under any obligation to share those numbers.

	Unlike last season, when COVID-19 cases swept through major college football, postponing and cancelling games weekly, no games have needed to be rescheduled because of a COVID-19 outbreak.

	Rolovich was hired from Hawaii two years ago, after Mike Leach left for Mississippi State, and led Washington State to a 1-3 record in the Pac-12 in a 2020 season cut short because of the pandemic. Washington State has won its past three games and is 4-3 this season, including a 34-31 win over Stanford last Saturday. He finishes with a 5-6 record at the Pullman campus in southeastern Washington.

	Rolovich revealed in July that he would not get vaccinated and couldn't attend Pac-12 media day in person because of it.

	He said in mid-August that he intended to follow the new mandate requiring vaccinations for every state employee but repeatedly declined to say how.

	After refusing for weeks to reveal his plans, Rolovich on Oct. 9 confirmed he was seeking a religious exemption to the mandate. He has not specified his religious beliefs.

	Chun said he met with Rolovich over a period of several months, but could not change the coach's mind.

	""He was resolute in his stance,"" Chun said.

	Rolovich needed to prove a sincerely held religious belief that prevented him from getting vaccinated in his exemption application. The application was put before a committee that reviewed the requests without knowing names of the applicants.

	To continue coaching, Rolovich needed to receive the religious exemption and also to have Chun determine that Rolovich could do his job while keeping the public safe. In addition to his work as a coach, Rolovich oversaw a youth football program and participated in promotional and fundraising events.

	Dickert is in his second season as Washington State's defensive coordinator and came to Pullman after three seasons at Wyoming. He has not previously been a head coach.

	Chun said the school is looking to hire assistants immediately to fill the vacancies on the staff.

	Washington State President Kirk Schulz said nearly 90% of WSU employees and 97% of students had been vaccinated. Fewer than 50 of some 10,000 employees have sought exemptions, Schulz said.

	The vaccine issue has percolated all season, dividing Washington State fans and providing a continual distraction.

	""There was a lot of frustration with such a prominent employee choosing to be unvaccinated,"" Schulz said.

	Players stood up for their coach as the season progressed. Quarterback Jayden de Laura told a sideline reporter after Saturday's win: ""Stop hating on Rolo. We love him.""

	Wide receiver Travell Harris commended Rolovich after the game for being a ""players' coach.""

	""He's a coach we all love to play for,"" Harris said.

"Prospect of no jab, no visa for Australian Open tennis stars","Oct. 19, 2021 5:22 p.m. CST","
     
    
	Tennis players who haven't received a COVID-19 vaccination are unlikely to get a visa to enter the country for the Australian Open in Melbourne in January, according to the political leader of the state which hosts the season-opening major.

	Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews has already introduced a vaccine mandate for professional athletes competing in domestic sports leagues and people working in some industries including health. On Tuesday, he increased the pressure on tennis players traveling from abroad.

	""I don't think any unvaccinated tennis player is going to get a visa to come into this country,"" Andrews said. ""If they did get a visa, they'd probably have to quarantine for a couple of weeks when no other players will have to.

	Australia is preparing to re-open its international borders for the first time in more than 18 months, but it'll be a gradual, state-by-state process starting next month and will depend on vaccination rates across the country. Fully vaccinated people will have fewer restrictions in Australia than those who are not.

	The vaccination debate has been ongoing in tennis since international competition started re-emerging following a global shutdown last year.

	Some players, including men's No. 1 Novak Djokovic, have advocated that the decision to get the vaccine should be a personal choice. Others, including Andy Murray, have said it should be mandated for the good of the majority.

	At the U.S. Open, which ended Sept. 12, spectators had to show proof of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine to attend matches, although players weren't required to get a shot.

	Victoria Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion and three-time runner-up at the U.S. Open, thought that sent a mixed message. She reached the U.S. Open final in 2020, when there were no fans allowed.

	""To me that's a bit bizarre that fans have to be vaccinated and players are not,"" Azarenka said. ""So I think that in my opinion, it's inevitable that it will be mandated at some point, like other leagues are doing.""

	Both the men's and the women's tours are recommending all players get vaccinated but so far have not enforced it. Just before the U.S. Open, roughly half of the elite male and female players were vaccinated.

	Ahead of the Australian Open earlier this year, all players had to quarantine for two weeks and be regularly tested under Australia's strict regulations on COVID-19 measures.

	Most were allowed a limited time to practice, but any who tested positive or we deemed to be close contacts of a positive case -- which in some cases meant simply being on the same charter flight -- had to do a hard lockdown. Those players weren't allowed to leave their hotel rooms.

	Melbourne, which hosts season-opening Formula One Grand Prix races, the richest horse race in the southern hemisphere and the biggest football crowd in Australia, has either barred crowds or shifted sports events interstate during months of lockdown in recent months.

Experts caution numbers of fully-vaccinated in hospital present 'skewed' version of reality,"Oct. 19, 2021 10:19 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
     On the surface, the numbers appear alarming.  During first two weeks of October, statistics from the BC Centre for Disease Control show nearly a quarter of people hospitalized for COVID-19 in the province were fully vaccinated. 
    Advertisement
     That appears to be sharply higher than just a month earlier.

But experts say to understand what the numbers actually mean about your risk of a breakthrough case that lands you in hospital, you have to look at rates within the population, rather than the raw data.  “It exists only because so much more of the population is vaccinated,” said cardiologist and epidemiologist Dr. Christopher Labos.  “So when you just look at the raw numbers, you get a skewed version of reality,” Labos said.  Labos explained that because vaccines aren’t a perfect “shield” against infection, as more and more British Columbians are fully vaccinated, more and more will become infected with COVID-19 and end up hospitalized.  “Over time we should fully expect that the percentage of people in hospital that are fully vaccinated is going to go up, because there’s just going to be more of them,” Labos said.​  Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, pointed out that those that are older and also at risk of disease are over-represented within the doubled-dosed group, which means the data has to be age adjusted to create a true picture of risk.  “When we adjust things for age, it reassures me, it is affecting those who we knew to be at risk of serious disease since the beginning of the pandemic,” Conway said.  Taking the same data from the first two weeks of October, the hospitalization rate for those fully vaccinated is 2.3 people for every 100,000.  The rate for those partially vaccinated is 10.4 people for every 100,000.  And for those not yet vaccinated, it soars to 51.3.  Put another way, and widening out to cover the span of a month, data from the BCCDC shows those who are unvaccinated are roughly 10 times more likely to be infected with COVID-19, 52 times more likely to be hospitalized, and 44 times more likely to die, than British Columbians who are fully vaccinated.  “The vaccines clearly and unequivocally have helped reduce the rates of COVID-19,” Lobos said.  A recent analysis from the BCCDC found two doses of any COVID-19 vaccine was approximately 95 per cent effective against hospitalization.  Even so, Conway expressed concern over his expectation that both older people and those more at-risk for serious disease will continue to account for an increasing proportion of serious COVID-19 cases.    “We need to vaccinate the unvaccinated as soon as we can. We need to consider third shots in more people in a targeted way,” Conway said, adding that arguments could be made for offering a booster to anyone 65 years or older, or those those had their second dose at least six months ago.  Last Thursday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry noted her team was watching breakthrough cases carefully, and digging through new data and evidence around who should be getting boosters next.  “We’ll have more to say about that soon, but that is the one of the things we’re looking at in some detail,” Henry said.

Half of Canadian parents plan to get their young kids vaccinated against COVID-19: poll,"Oct. 18, 2021 11:00 p.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	It appears half of Canadian and the majority of B.C. parents are anxious to get their young kids vaccinated against COVID-19.

	Results from a new survey from the Angus Reid Institute suggests strong support to get shots in the arms of five to 11-year-olds as soon as possible.

	According to the data, half of Canadian parents say they plan to vaccinate their elementary school-aged children as soon as a vaccine is available to them.

	Eighteen per cent said they would get their kids inoculated eventually and 23 per cent said they will not be getting their kids vaccinated.

	The percentage of parents opposed to the kids' vaccine is lower in B.C., sitting at 15 per cent, according to the survey.

	The poll's results suggested support for adolescent vaccination is higher among parents with a university education and those with higher incomes.

	There is currently no vaccine approved for kids under the age of 12 in Canada, though Pfizer recently submitted data suggesting its vaccine is safe for kids aged five to 11.

	COVID-19 cases have spiked in B.C. schools since kids returned to class last month.

	However, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has maintained the risk of serious illness from the virus is relatively low in kids.

	B.C. is allowing parents to register kids for their first jab, but one public policy expert says there hasn’t been sufficient messaging about COVID vaccinations in children.

	“I'd love to see more age specific registration. We could also do really basic things like get schools to send letters to all the parents with kids between the ages of five and 11, so they actually know this registration is happening,” said Heidi Tworek, a professor of public policy at the University of British Columbia.

	Tworek says parents need to be provided with enough information to make an informed decision.

	“We need to explain to parents how the approval process is functioning and how is this vaccine different than the vaccine for over 12 so they can feel confident in registering their kids and having them vaccinated as soon as the vaccine might be approved,” Tworek told CTV News.

	THIRD DOSES

	The survey also revealed an appetite for a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine among most vaccinated Canadians.

	Sixty-two per cent of those surveyed said they would take the shot right away if it were offered, while another 20 per cent said they would get an additional dose eventually but would be in no rush.

	“Vaccine hesitancy has diminished month by month since the rollout began in the early parts of 2021. Currently just one-in-12 Canadian adults currently say they haven’t been vaccinated,” a statement from the Angus Reid Institute said.

	Booster shots have been offered in Canada in a limited capacity so far.

	In B.C, people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised may be able get a third dose four weeks after their second one.

	Those who are eligible will be contacted through the province's Get Vaccinated system.

	Residents of long-term care and assisted living centres are also being offered an additional dose six months after their second dose.

	The survey found the willingness to get a booster dose was also influenced by political ideology.

	“Past Conservative and Bloc Québécois voters who have been vaccinated are much less likely than those who recently supported the Liberals and NDP to say that they would immediately receive a booster,” said the institute's statement.

	DOUBT OF A RETURN TO NORMAL

	At the start of the pandemic, a poll conducted by the Institute showed few respondents thought that COVID-19 would impact their lives longer than six months, but doubt that a return to normal is near is growing.

	“Currently, the largest group of Canadians (37 per cent) say that Canada will never return to the way that it was before February 2020,” read a summary of the survey.

	That’s roughly double the number of people who shared the view last year.

	Personal concern over contracting the virus also rose in the last month.

	“Three-in-five (57 per cent) Canadians are very or moderately concerned about being infected, a decline from a peak of 71 per cent at the beginning of the year, but a climb from a summer valley of 47 per cent.”

	The institute conducted the online surveys from Sept. 29 to Oct. 3, 2021, among a representative randomized sample of 5,011 Canadian adults who are members of Angus Reid Forum.

	For comparison purposes only, a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

	The survey was self-commissioned and paid for by ARI.

	Ten of the latest victims lived in the Fraser Health region, while five each lived in the Interior Health and Northern Health regions, and three each lived in the Vancouver Coastal Health and Island Health regions.

	Fraser Health also recorded the highest number of cases over the weekend, with 737, though it's worth noting the health authorities have vastly different populations. Northern Health's 406 cases translates to 142.8 infections per 100,000 population, compared to 38.6 infections per 100,000 population in Fraser Health.

	Vancouver Coastal Health saw the lowest rate of infection, with 17.8 cases per 100,000 population.

	The number of infectious COVID-19 patients in hospital, which hasn't dipped below 300 since mid-September, decreased slightly to 360, including 151 in intensive care.

	Once again, the government's statistics indicate the majority of B.C.'s cases and hospitalizations involve people who are either unvaccinated against COVID-19 or only partially vaccinated.

	""88 per cent of those in critical care today due to COVID-19 were not fully vaccinated,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix said on Twitter.

	The unvaccinated account for 86 per cent of coronavirus-positive patients in ICU, including 25 of the 26 patients who are under the age of 40. They also account for 68 per cent of all cases recorded across the province over the past two weeks.

	

	

	The numbers are particularly striking given that the unvaccinated make up a small minority of British Columbians, accounting for less than 20 per cent of the population, including the young children who are currently ineligible for any of the approved vaccines.

	According to the Ministry of Health, the unvaccinated were infected at a rate of 268 cases per 100,000 people from Oct. 8 to 14, compared to 29.4 cases per 100,000 people among the fully vaccinated.

	As of Monday, 89.2 per cent of those eligible have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 83.4 per cent have received both. More than eight million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered across B.C. so far, with some of those going to non-residents.

	Officials also announced four new COVID-19 outbreaks in health-care facilities, at Queens Park Centre in New Westminster, Heritage Village in Chilliwack, Menno Terrace West in Abbotsford, and Amica Lions Gate in West Vancouver. Another outbreak at Joseph Creek Care Village ended, leaving 22 active outbreaks across B.C.'s health-care system.

Mandatory PCR test remains barrier for travellers as U.S. reopens borders to Canada,"Oct. 16, 2021 9:34 a.m. CST","
     
     Victoria - 
     
    
	On Nov. 8, the land and sea borders will open up again for Canadians wanting to visit the U.S. The question is, will anyone make the trip?

	""We’d love to go back down,"" said Vancouver Island resident Harry Little.

    Advertisement
    
	But, there’s a catch.

       Victoria Clipper suspends service to U.S. until 2022U.S. says it will permit entry of Canadian travellers with mixed vaccine doses Canada-U.S. will reopen land border to fully vaccinated visitors in November

	""It’s probably going to be easy to get down but coming back is going to be the problem,"" said Little. ""If it’s going to be really difficult we won’t be doing any travelling.""

	The fact that Canada will still require proof of a negative PCR test within 72 hours of re-entry into the country is a common concern. That COVID-19 test starts at $129 and increases in price, depending on how fast you need the results.

	""You don’t want to pay an extra $150 for a shopping trip or something like that, you know what I mean?” said islander Duncan Rumak.

	""It’s basically the reason we decided not to do our annual trip,"" said Ben Rumak.

	That test has the Black Ball Ferry Line, which operates the Coho Ferry between Victoria and Port Angeles, questioning if it’s even worth starting up again.

	""It’s a difficult thing, no doubt about it,"" said Ryan Burles, president of the Black Ball Ferry Line.

	""We don’t know whether the PCR is here to stay for two months or six months,"" he said. ""That’s a big hurdle.""

	Burles knows there will be demand from snowbirds wanting to head south for the winter. But that business is not enough to sustain the operating costs of the ferry.

	The company said on Friday that it is going to take the weekend to decide if it’s worth starting up again.

	South of the border in Port Angeles, Washington, excitement is high, but locals know they’re not going to see many Canadian visitors until the Coho Ferry begins to run again. So expectations are tempered for now until that PCR test is gone from the equation.

	""Once that PCR test is gone, I think we’re going to see a true opening of the border,"" said Marc Abshire, executive director of the Port Angeles Chamber of Commerce.

	The mayor of Port Angeles agrees.

	""It sounds like one of the big issues on the Canadian side is also the PCR,"" said Kate Dexter, Mayor of Port Angeles. ""So, yes, if the Coho’s running it means there’s no PCR test likely and so I’m hopeful that we will see Canadians.""

	As a bit of a loophole, Canadians could get tested in Canada and if they are returning within 72 hours, they could use those results to get back into the country.

	One last big question was cleared up on Friday evening, when U.S. officials confirmed that Canadians who received mixed vaccine doses would be considered fully vaccinated.

	So come Nov. 8, many Canadians may just decide to stay home until crossing the border becomes less cumbersome and less expensive.

	""It isn’t worth the hassle,"" said Judy Little. ""We’ll wait until they straighten it all out. So for now, no.""

Sask. reveals rough timeline for COVID-19 vaccine approval for children between ages 5 to 11 ,"Oct. 16, 2021 8:18 a.m. CST","
     
     SASKATOON - 
     
    
	The provincial government has given an expected date for when vaccines for children between 5 and 11.

	The province’s top doctor Dr. Saqib Shahab says Pfizer has submitted a request to give a lower dose vaccine to children aged 5 to 11.

    Advertisement
    
	“Vaccines may be available by November and I think many provinces are looking forward to that,"" said Shahab, “we are looking forward with anticipation that vaccine for 5 to 11-year-old's will be approved by Health Canada by November.”

	Shahab specified there is no firm timeline in place just yet.

	Lea Corpuz is a mother to three children under the age of 11 and for her, the news of approved vaccines is welcoming.

	“I’m so happy if the vaccine will come so my kids are safer and I won’t have to worry about COVID at school,” said Corpuz.

	She says it would remove the hassle of having to test her children for COVID-19.

	“I have to swab test them because there is somebody at school (who has) coronavirus.”

	According to the province, about a third of cases are coming from school aged children. Cory Neudorf, Saskatchewan Health Authority Interim Senior Medical Officer, says getting children vaccinated could help push the province to achieve an 85 to 95 per cent overall vaccination rate.

	“Including children in that age category as eligible for immunization, it just really helps to increase immunity for our province,” said Neudorf.

	Neudorf says parents should have no concerns over giving children vaccines if it is approved by Health Canada.

	“With these vaccines, they find the lowest effective dose possible so that kids don’t have unnecessary side effects.”

     KITCHENER - 
     
    
	As Premier Doug Ford awaits the response from hospital CEOs across Ontario regarding their thoughts on a vaccine policy for staff, local hospitals are adjusting to the mandate already implemented.

	The mandatory COVID-19 vaccine policy went into effect for Waterloo Region and Wellington County hospitals on Wednesday, resulting in hundreds of staff being placed on unpaid leaves.

	Grand River Hospital in Kitchener initially put 170 staff and physicians on leave, but CEO Ron Gagnon says that number has since dropped to 124.

	“It shows you the impact of having this policy, because those numbers continue to come down,” he said. “Yesterday there was even some of that group who have now stepped forward and are getting their first vaccination, so that’s great.”

	Over at St. Mary’s in Kitchener, 27 staff are on unpaid leave, 51 at Cambridge Memorial, and 31 at Guelph General.

	“It made me feel very sad,” said Dr. Nicola Mercer, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph’s Medical Officer of Health. “These are good, well-paying jobs, and for people who have often been in these institutions for some time.”

	On Friday, Ford issued a letter to hospital CEO’s asking their input on the policies, which are not province-wide.

	“I’m going to continue to preach that I want every single health care worker to get vaccinated,” he said. “People have to look at the ramifications down the road, where are we going to be in two or three months when they’re short tens of thousands of people, nurses, and doctors?”

	Gagnon says the shortage of workers has led to one less operating room at Grand River.

	“We have come down one operating room,” he said. “We were operating one additional room compared to what we normally do, so we are back to our normal.

	“I continue to be 100 per cent confident we are following the right approach when it comes to protecting our staff, protecting our community, and protecting our patients.”

	Ford is asking all hospitals to respond to his letter by next Tuesday.

	Two of the deaths were in the Interior Health region and the other 11 were in Fraser Health.

	The province also reported one new COVID-19 outbreak at a health-care facility. That outbreak, at GR Baker Memorial Hospital in Quesnel, is in the province’s Northern Health region. The rural region is seeing high COVID-19 case spread and its intensive care units have been overwhelmed.

	One COVID-19 outbreak, at Good Samaritan Delta View Care Centre in Fraser Health authority, was declared over. There are 19 other active outbreaks in health-care settings, according to the ministry.

	The new cases means there are now 5,128 active cases of COVID-19. Of the active cases, 367 people are in hospital, 152 of whom are in intensive care. The number of people in B.C. who have recovered from COVID-19 is now 188,851.

	As of Friday, 89 per cent of eligible people 12 and older in B.C. have received their first dose, the same percentage reported on Thursday. Despite the fact that the percentage remains the same, an additional 3,314 people received their first dose of the vaccine over the one-day period – it just wasn’t enough to bump the percentage count up. And, 83.7 per cent of eligible residents have received two doses, an increase from 82.9 per cent on Thursday.

	Of the new cases, 246 are in Fraser Health, 184 are in Northern Health, 75 in Vancouver Coastal Health, and 59 in Island Health, and 101 in Interior Health.

	Notably, however, Fraser Health has more than six times the population of Northern Health, meaning the northern region added far more cases per capita than Fraser Health – or the province’s other three health regions.

	To address the spread of COVID-19 in Northern Health, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced new restrictions on Thursday as the region’s hospitals were overwhelmed.

	As of Friday, personal gatherings – whether indoor or outdoor – are restricted to fully vaccinated people in parts of Northern B.C.

	""If you are unvaccinated or have unvaccinated people in your households, then you need to stay with your household only,"" Henry said when speaking to the Northern Health measures.

"Nova Scotia introduces legislation prohibiting anti-vaccine protests near hospitals, pharmacies","Oct. 16, 2021 3:49 a.m. CST","
     
     HALIFAX - 
     
    
	Protests that block access to hospitals and other health-care facilities could soon be banned in Nova Scotia under newly proposed legislation.

	The Progressive Conservative government tabled the Protecting Access to Health Services Act Thursday, which it said would also ban protests at the homes of patients who receive care where they live.

    Advertisement
    
	Premier Tim Houston said the legislation would establish a 50-metre ""safe access bubble"" around hospitals and other facilities such as doctors' offices, where protests would not be permitted.
        RELATED STORIES
       Quebec swiftly passes new bill to prohibit anti-vaccine protests near schools, hospitalsNova Scotia's modified phase five reopening met with mixed reaction

	""Health-care workers have disproportionately been through a lot with the pandemic,"" Houston told reporters. ""This is all designed to make sure that our health-care professionals know that their government supports them in having a safe and healthy workplace.""

	The premier added that while people have a right to protest, they can't be allowed to disrupt access to health care. ""There are places where (protesting) should be done and there are places where that should not be done,"" he said.

	Nova Scotia joins Quebec, which adopted a law banning COVID-19-related protests outside schools and hospitals. Quebec's law, however, must be renewed every 30 days for it to remain in effect, and it expires when the government lifts the pandemic-related state of emergency. Alberta, meanwhile, recently announced it was adding hospitals, clinics and other health-care facilities to a list of essential infrastructure protected under an anti-blockade law.

	The Nova Scotia legislation, which is not limited to the province's current pandemic-related state of emergency, comes in the wake of several protests against COVID-19 measures that were held outside health facilities across the country in September. Houston said his government's bill is largely in direct response to those and other health-related protests.

	""Certainly that's front and centre in my mind ΓÇª but who knows what the issue might be in the future,"" he said.

	And although Houston said the 50-metre buffer would also apply to union picket lines outside hospitals, there doesn't appear to be a specific reference to labour unions in the language of the bill. The government said Thursday that peaceful protests would still be allowed outside health-care facilities as long as they are outside the buffer zone.

	Liberal Leader Iain Rankin and NDP Leader Gary Burrill both expressed support for the idea behind the legislation, but they said they needed to evaluate the bill further before staking a position.

"'Another tragically high total': Alberta reports 30 deaths, 916 new COVID-19 cases","Oct. 15, 2021 8:43 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON -

       Hinshaw apologizes after Alberta mistakenly reports 14-year-old's cancer death was caused by COVID-19COVID-19 in Alberta: 38 deaths, 652 new cases on Wednesday

	Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the deaths reported Thursday were from Oct. 7 to 13, and that the majority of people were unvaccinated.

	“This is another tragically high total,” she said. “The high number of fatalities that we have seen recently are the result of rapid spread.

	“This is another reason why we all need to keep limiting in-person contact and driving cases downward.”

	The 30 deaths reported Thursday raised the pandemic total to 2,930. All the newly reported deaths were from people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, except for three between the ages of 50 and 60.

	

	

	There are now 1,016 Albertans in hospital with COVID-19, including 231 in ICU. Sixty-seven people were hospitalized on Thursday, driven primarily by those aged 60 to 69, 50 to 59, and 40 to 49.

	

			A Flourish chart


	In a statement to CTV News, Alberta Health Services (AHS) said it continues to do all it can to ensure ICU capacity can meet patient demand.

	'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC'

	As of 2 p.m. Thursday, there are 372 total ICU beds in the province, with 282 full.

	“While the number of patients in ICU fluctuates constantly, the number of patients in ICU has decreased by five per cent over the past seven days,” AHS said in a statement.

	The North Zone has the highest amount of ICU capacity filled. As of Thursday afternoon, it was operating at 84 per cent.

	The South Zone has 83 per cent capacity filled, while ICU capacity in the Edmonton Zone is operating at 76 per cent. ICU capacity in the Central and Calgary zones was at 75 and 72 per cent, respectively.

	Nineteen more people were admitted to ICUs on Thursday, mostly driven by those aged 60 to 69 and 70 to 79. One admission was of an Albertan between the ages of five and nine years old.

	

	

	“This is a significant improvement from just one month ago when our ICUs were close to 90 per cent occupancy, including the surge capacity, and the number of ICU patients was increasing rapidly each day,” said Dr. Verna Yiu, AHS CEO and president.

	According to Yiu, the average number of ICU patients admitted in Alberta has reduced from more than 20 a day to about 13 to 15.

	“This is still a high number because these admissions are preventable,” Yiu added. “We are grateful that the numbers appear to be falling.

	“But we know that this trend can be reversed easily, especially if we become complacent, and we remain uncertain as to the potential impact of the Thanksgiving weekend.”

	Yiu said surgical teams are carefully planning to increase the amount of procedures offered again in hospitals in the province, but that there is “no timeline” for a return to normal surgical volumes.

	On Wednesday, Alberta Health reported 38 COVID-19 deaths and 652 new cases.

	Just over 85 per cent of eligible Albertans have one vaccine dose and 76.2 per cent have two.

	INFLUENZA SEASON

	With the arrival of colder temperatures, Hinshaw said it is important everyone receive their annual flu shot.

	“While influenza and COVID-19 are very different illnesses, several of the symptoms are the same,” she said.

	The majority of measures that help limit the spread of COVID-19, like increased handwashing and sanitization, and physical distancing, are effective against influenza, she said.

	“We don’t need to look further than the last influenza season for proof of that,” Hinshaw said.

	“Despite conducting about 2.5 times the number of influenza tests as we did the previous year, we had zero lab confirmed cases of seasonal influenza and no influenza deaths.”

	This year, Hinshaw said there have already been three lab confirmed influenza cases. She urged Albertans to get their flu shot once they become available.

	Last year the province saw the highest amount of flu shots administered in the past 10 years, with more than 1.65 million doses administered.

	Every Albertan over the age of six months can is eligible to receive a free annual influenza vaccination at a pharmacy or some doctor offices. 

	“Influenza remains a serious and deadly virus,” she added. “To ease the system strain caused by increased demand for COVID-19 and influenza testing, I urge every eligible Albertan to get the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines as soon as you are able to.

	“This will greatly reduce the number of people who get infected and the number of symptomatic people who need to be tested.”

	Hinshaw said that scientific and medical reviews determined it is safe for people to receive both their COVID-19 vaccine and influenza vaccine at the same time.

	More information about Alberta’s influenza campaign and flu shots is expected to be released in the coming days.

"Dozens of local hospital staff members, including nurses, on unpaid leave over vaccine policy","Oct. 15, 2021 7:13 a.m. CST","
     
     Barrie, Ont. - 
     
    
	Forty-five staff members at Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre (RVH) face termination from Simcoe County's largest hospital because they are not double vaccinated against COVID-19.

	Janice Skot, RVH President and CEO, says the unvaccinated employees, about half of which are nurses, were put on unpaid leave last week.

	Those employees have until Oct. 31 to be vaccinated, or they will lose their jobs.  Children 5 to 11 approved to get COVID-19 vaccine as cases surge in Simcoe MuskokaSMDHU adds new safety measures as COVID-19 cases surge and death toll climbsInfectious disease expert addresses most common pandemic questions Vaccine mandates leave dozens of Simcoe County workers out of a job'I just couldn't believe it,' Friends shocked by vaccinated Oro-Medonte man's deathOnt. health unit warns rapid antigen tests are not to be used to diagnose COVID-19Does your child have COVID-19 symptoms? Here's what Simcoe Muskoka parents need to know

	""We're really optimistic that of those people who are currently home on an unpaid leave of absence will continue to reflect on the importance of safety for everyone,"" Skot says.

	""In this pandemic, we know that vaccination is the safest way to ensure that we have a safe work environment and safety for our patients,"" she adds.

	Another 14 unvaccinated employees have been dismissed for refusing to submit to twice-weekly testing mandated by the province.

	Skot says several casual part-time workers are among the suspended and terminated groups and stresses that 99 per cent of the hospital's 3,500 staff and contractors are fully vaccinated.

	The transition comes at the same time as a sign at RVH's entrance warns that emergency department wait times are longer than usual and asks for patience.

	Skot concedes suspensions and terminations over-vaccination status could be playing a role in longer than usual wait times in the hospital's emergency department, though she adds that the volume of patients coming in has also increased.

	Skot says RVH is ""continuously"" hiring nurses and other staff members, with 80 new recruits welcomed last week.

	""We are committed to ensuring that the public continues to receive the care that they deserve and they expect at RVH,"" she notes.

	RVH and Orillia Soldiers' Memorial Hospital are among 14 central region health care signatories to a joint COVID-19 staff vaccination policy.

	Soldiers' Memorial has terminated two employees who refused to submit to regular testing and suspended 16 people among its staff of 1,500 who aren't vaccinated.

	President and CEO Carmine Stumpo explains that the hospital has been leaning on its vaccinated physicians, midwives, and dentists to answer questions, dispel myths, and attempt to break through vaccine hesitancy.

	""We really want to work with our staff to get to that 100 per cent compliance. That's what's going to keep us safe, it's going to keep our community safe, and that has always been our intention,"" he says.

	SEIU Healthcare, which represents thousands of staff at Simcoe County hospitals, has endorsed mandatory COVID-19 vaccines as a matter of safety.

	But union president Sharleen Stewart sees them as highlighting an existing staffing shortage crisis.

	""The unvaccinated obviously are adding to the numbers, but there many vaccinated frontline workers who are leaving the profession,"" Stewart says.

	She points to poor working conditions, workplace violence and insufficient pay as some of the factors driving healthcare workers to make a change.

	The province says those booking will need to meet the definition for moderately to severely immunocompromised, and vaccine clinics will review the patients information to ensure they meet the definition or are on one of the eligible medications. Those who do not qualify will not be given a third dose. More information is available on the province’s website.

	The province also announced that third doses will be made available to people who need to travel for work to meet entry requirements or avoid isolation in a country that does not recognize mixed doses.

	“The decision by some countries not to recognize mixed doses has created financial hardship for people whose job requires them to travel,” says the release.

	To become eligible for a third dose for work-related travel, applicants must:

	
		be a Nova Scotia resident
	
		provide an official copy of proof of vaccination for each of the two doses received
	
		provide written confirmation from their employer that they are required to travel to a country as part of their job and that country does not accept a mixed-vaccine series
	
		provide official confirmation or documentation from the country or location of travel that a mixed-vaccine series does not permit entry or requires isolation upon entry.


	Work-related third doses must be applied for by AdminINS@novascotia.ca with the necessary information, and cannot be booked online or by phone.

	The province says applicants will hear back within seven business days if they are approved, and receive details on scheduling an appointment.

Sask. healthcare system 'creaking' amid fourth wave,"Oct. 14, 2021 4:31 a.m. CST","
     
     SASKATOON - 
     
    
	Healthcare workers in Saskatchewan are having to choose who gets appropriate critical care and which patients will receive care on the hospital floor.

	It’s a glimpse into what the current COVID-19 situation looks like in the province.

    Advertisement
    
	“The system is creaking, we’re at the level of the pandemic where it is really taxing our system,” said Dr. John Froh, deputy chief medical health officer with the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA).

Saskatoon police issuing tickets in connection to mostly-maskless PPC election night partySask. premier's approval down 20 points as COVID-19 hammers province: surveySaskatoon restaurant owner finds lack of provincial mandate on proof of vaccination for staff 'confusing'

	“It’s shuddering under the burden and the burden will grow.”

	Froh’s commentary came during the SHA’s weekly physician town hall on Oct. 7.

	Froh said Saskatchewan is well into the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the surge in cases is being driven by the Delta variant.

	Saskatchewan’s ICU pressures have the healthcare system moving from the yellow to red zone, he said.

	That means the limited healthcare staff are providing substandard care for patients in critical need and/or at risk of death, more service slowdowns, an increase in preventable deaths and the possibility of transporting ICU patients out of province, he said.

	“We continue to grow in terms of cases and we haven’t turned a corner.""

	The physician town hall offered some bleak predictions when it comes to ICU admissions in the coming weeks.

	As of the town hall on Oct. 7, the SHA reported the total number of ICU patients across the province at 114, of which 79 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19.

	SHA projections show ICU capacity for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients could exceed 115 beds by Sunday - and the province could eclipse 125 ICU beds by Oct. 24.

	“I know we’ll be sending patients out of province,” said Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Susan Shaw.

	The province broke records each day last week in terms of new cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions.

	Shaw noted one patient is receiving care on the hospital floor, hooked up to high-flow oxygen.

	“I know they’re getting excellent care on the floor but it’s not the standard we want to provide,” Shaw said.

	Shaw said the possibility of Saskatchewan’s healthcare system moving towards triage protocols is becoming more real.

	“I'm finding it hard to find a path that doesn't get us there,” Shaw said.

	She also noted with Saskatchewan adding 450 new COVID-19 cases every day, many will need care in a hospital.

	“And a percentage of those are going to need ICU,” she said.

	The physician town hall also heard how 55 per cent of patients with COVID-19 had their first diagnosis with a test in the emergency room or ICU.

	“So we don't have a window to do a lot of early intervention,” Shaw said.

	On the immunization front, 80.1 per cent of eligible Saskatchewan residents have received a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, last among the provinces.

	74.9 per cent have received two vaccines, the second-lowest mark in Canada, just ahead of Alberta.

"Sarnia, Ont., mayor welcomes planned U.S. land border reopening","Oct. 14, 2021 1:53 a.m. CST","
     
     Toronto, Ont. - 
     
    
	The mayor of an Ontario border city welcomed the news that fully vaccinated Canadians will be able to drive into the United States starting next month, but said more details are needed to ensure travellers can go back and forth between the two countries safely.

	Sarnia Mayor Mike Bradley said Wednesday that he believes Canadians will be cautious about driving south for day trips given that some parts of the U.S. have looser public health measures and higher COVID-19 case counts — a concern he said also emerged when Canada eased its border restrictions for Americans earlier this year.

    Advertisement
    
	""I do believe the Canadian government made a mistake by opening our border without getting a reciprocal arrangement with the Americans. It's four months later, but it's happening, and it's a good thing,'' he said.

	""I just need to make sure that all the things will be in place to protect people when they go there and come back,'' the mayor said.

	""I do not see a lot of people wanting to go over on day tripping for some time to come because of what's happening in places like Michigan and elsewhere, where there re no restrictions on masking and gathering and things like that.''

	Senior government officials delivered news of the land border reopening to reporters on condition that they hold reports until early Wednesday, but the plan was announced by New York congressman Brian Higgins late Tuesday.

	Few details have been released so far, but the plan is designed to dovetail with the Biden administration's intention to allow international travellers from further afield to resume travel to the U.S. on the same timeline, provided they've been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

	In order to be considered fully vaccinated, travellers must have received a full course of a COVID-19 vaccine approved by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization. That includes Oxford-AstraZeneca, a vaccine used in Canada that never received FDA approval.

	It's not yet known whether those who received mixed doses will be deemed eligible.

	No specific dates have been set for the changes to take effect. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is expected to lay out more details of the plan today.

	Travel between the U.S., Canada and Mexico by vehicle, rail and ferry has been largely restricted to essential travel, such as trade, since the early days of the global health crisis.

	Fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents have been allowed back into Canada since August, provided they have waited at least 14 days since getting a full course of a Health Canada-approved vaccine and can show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test.

	Beginning in early November, the U.S. plans to allow fully vaccinated visitors from a host of countries, including China, India, Ireland, Iran, South Africa, Brazil and the 26 European countries without border controls, known as the Schengen group.

	TUESDAY ANNOUNCEMENTS

	Earlier Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry spoke at a live news conference.

	The health officials announced that children between the ages of five and 11 are now required to wear masks in indoor public spaces effective immediately.

	B.C.'s top doctor also said that the province was preparing its plans to vaccinate children in this age group, if COVID-19 vaccines are approved for use in kids by Health Canada.

	Meanwhile, both Henry and Dix urged all British Columbians, particularly people living in the Northern Health region, to get vaccinated.

	B.C.'s health minister described the situation in Northern Health as ""very serious,"" noting that dozens of people have been transferred out of hospitals in the region for critical care in recent weeks.

	Dix says that out of the past 55 recent transfers, 43 of the patients were being treated for COVID-19, and 42 of those people were not fully vaccinated.

	""For those people walking around unvaccinated who might be in those critical care beds in two or three weeks, now is the time to get vaccinated,"" he said.

	Health officials added that vaccinations help reduce the severity of the illness if you contract COVID-19, and help protect vulnerable people who may not be able to receive a vaccine themselves, such as young children.

	Dix noted that patients in the Northern Health region had to be flown ""hundreds and hundreds of kilometres,"" to reach hospitals in other health regions, including Island Health, which can add stress to families, patients and health-care systems across the province.

	As of Tuesday, 88.8 per cent of people aged 12 and older had received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in B.C., while 82.6 per cent of eligible people have received two doses.

	Health officials say there is community spread in the Central zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.

	Public Health says it is closely monitoring all four health zones for community spread.

	EXPOSURE NOTICES FOR EIGHT HALIFAX AREA SCHOOLS

	Health officials also sent exposure notices for eight schools in the Halifax Regional Municipality on Tuesday.

	The latest school exposures are at École Mer et Monde, École Beaubassin, Halifax West High, Chebucto Heights Elementary and Joesph Howe Elementary in Halifax, Dartmouth South Academy and Ian Forsyth Elementary in Dartmouth, and Seaside Elementary in Eastern Passage.

	“It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious,” said N.S. Health in a release.

	A list of schools with exposures is available online.

	COVID-19 CASE DATA

	Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 4,138 tests on Oct. 8; 3,275 tests on Oct. 9; 2,497 tests on Oct.  10; and 2,334 tests on Oct. 11.

       Brooklyn Nets statement on Kyrie Irving, Oct. 12, 2021

	Irving hasn't said he isn't vaccinated, asking for privacy when he spoke via Zoom during the team's media day on Sept. 27.

	But he had rarely been with the team in New York, where a mandate requires professional athletes playing for a team in the city have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to play or practice in public venues.

	""Kyrie's made it clear that he has a choice in this matter and it's ultimately going to be up to him what he decides,"" general manager Sean Marks said. ""We respect the fact that he has a choice, he can make his own and right now what's best for the organization is the path that we're taking.""

	Teams aren't allowed to reveal private details of players' health. But asked Tuesday if Irving was vaccinated, Marks said: ""If he was vaccinated, we wouldn't be having this discussion. I think that's probably pretty clear.""

	Marks said he and owner Joe Tsai together made the decision, adding that it came through discussions with Irving and his associates.

	""Kyrie loves to play basketball, wants to be out there, wants to be participating with his teammates,"" Marks said. ""But again, this is a choice that Kyrie had and he was well aware of that.""

	Irving wasn't even eligible to practice with the Nets in New York until Friday, when the city told the team that its training facility was considered a private venue.

	Irving then joined the team at an outdoor practice Saturday and worked out with the Nets on Sunday, but didn't play in Brooklyn's exhibition game at Philadelphia on Monday.

	Coach Steve Nash had said that the Nets knew they were going to be missing Irving for some games. For now, at least, it will be all of them.

	With Kevin Durant, James Harden and Irving, the Nets were considered a favorite to win the NBA title. They were eliminated by the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round of last season's playoffs after Irving sprained his ankle and missed the final three games.

	Marks conceded that the Nets weren't as strong without Irving, though they may still be good enough.

	""At this point in time, the Nets have more than enough to win a championship,"" said Richard Jefferson, a former Nets star who now works for YES Network. ""I think adding Kyrie makes them, in my opinion, a heavy favorite and that's just kind of is what it is. With Kyrie this team can win 55, 60 games. Without Kyrie, this team could still win 55 games.""

	Marks wouldn't predict how long Irving would be away from the team or get into whether the Nets would consider trying to trade him.

	""The hope is that we have Kyrie back,"" Marks said. ""We'll welcome him back in open arms under a different set of circumstances and so we need to wait and see how that transpires. But in the meantime, we need to focus on the 16 players that are going to be on this roster moving forward with us.""

	NBA players are not required to be vaccinated, but they face more testing and restrictions on their ability to be around their teammates. The league had said that players wouldn't be paid for games they miss because they are ineligible to play.

	Marks said Irving would still be paid for road games.

	Teammates had said they were supportive of Irving's decision, but Marks seemed to indicate there was concern for the fan reaction. New York was hit hard in early March 2020 by the virus and the Nets' arena became a vaccination site this spring.

	""There are countless, countless workers who have lost jobs because of this, there are people who have lost loved ones and so forth and as I've mentioned before this is serious,"" Marks said. ""And we play a game of basketball. And although it's serious and we take our job extremely seriously, these are mandates that right now we don't have any control over. All we can do is abide by them and think that science and the people governing -- whether it's our city, whether it's our state, whether the country -- are making the right calls for us all to get back and to move on into a healthy and safer environment.""

Advocates want COVID-19 vaccine boosters for B.C. seniors in the community ,"Oct. 11, 2021 10:18 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Seniors living in long-term care are now being offered a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine, but elderly British Columbians who live in the community aren't, and advocates say that needs to change.

	“We are already hearing that some of the double shot Pfizer (recipients) are getting COVID again, and there have been deaths,” said Ramona Kaptyn, president of the Surrey/White Rock chapter of the Canadian Association of Retired Persons.

	Geriatrician Dr. Naaz Parmar is also hearing concern from her elderly patients, some of whom would likely be in long-term care, but have chosen to stay at home longer because of COVID-19.

	“They are seeing themselves at that same degree of frailty, they’re seeing themselves at a degree of exposure because they have care workers coming and going and other such things, but they are not in that first cohort,’ said Parmar.

	With Alberta now offering boosters to anyone over age 75, Parmar and CARP want British Columbia to act now.

	“It could be done just like before, starting with over-80s and then working down,” said Kaptyn. “We know how to do it. We’ve done it. I think it’s time to get on with it.”

	Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, believes seniors will get their third shot this year.

	“To me, it’s a matter of time,” Conway said. “And I think as other provinces do it, then it will probably push B.C. to do it more quickly. They will get it sooner rather than later, we just don’t know when yet.”

	And when third shots are offered to seniors, he’s hoping they can be administered in family doctors’ offices, instead of large-scale vaccine clinics.

	“If we are going to vaccinate more people more quickly, we need to put COVID vaccines in the hands of many more health-care providers,” Conway said.

	He thinks it could be done in conjunction with their flu shots, and believes there is adequate supply for third doses for British Columbians 65 and older.

	“We do have enough,” said Kaptyn. “I’m sure that we have enough. We’re giving some to other countries because we have too much now. So it is available, and it should be administered.”

Thanksgiving dinners could lead to COVID-19 spike: epidemiologist,"Oct. 11, 2021 7:06 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	Thanksgiving marks yet another pandemic holiday, and one epidemiologist is reminding Manitobans to remain careful to avoid a spike in COVID-19 cases.

	This weekend, many Manitobans are excited to see family for the first time in a while.

	""Well, we're just going to family's this afternoon, but yesterday we had dinner at another family member's, and you know it's pretty peaceful, pretty quiet this year,"" said Jody Stanton.

	Ben Henning, who is heading to his in-law’s for dinner to celebrate the holiday, said it has been a long time coming.

	""We're all vaccinated, so we are all safe,"" said Henning.

	""We are doing the responsible things. Trying to stay out of trouble and keeping the love real.

	Other Manitobans aren't quite ready to have large gatherings yet.

	""It's just a regular weekend with COVID and everything going on. It's just another year where we will be waiting,"" Randy Kendall, who is staying home this Thanksgiving.

	Staying home might not be a bad idea.

	Winnipeg-based epidemiologist Cynthia Carr said Thanksgiving last year caused a large spike in COVID-19 cases.

	""I think eight new cases per 100,000 on average right now, which is actually higher than where we were last year,"" she said. ""We don't want to see a five-fold increase like we did last year.""

	To help try and stop the spread, the province implemented new gathering limit restrictions ahead of the Thanksgiving weekend.

	Households are limited to guests from one other household for indoor private gatherings if an unvaccinated person, who is eligible to be vaccinated, is in attendance.

	Households are also limited to ten guests for outdoor private gatherings when an unvaccinated person, who is eligible to be vaccinated, is on the property.

	However, Carr said, even with the vaccine, gatherings like Thanksgiving present unique issues.

	""Family gatherings, friend gatherings often are multigenerational with older people and younger people. So again, you could have a mix of people who aren't vaccinated if they're too young or older people,” she said.

	On Friday, there were 130 new COVID-19 cases; 90 among unvaccinated individuals, seven among partially-vaccinated people, and 33 in fully vaccinated individuals.

	Carr said while the vaccine is effective in preventing severe outcomes, fully vaccinated individuals can still catch the virus.

	""It is the case like any other vaccine that even fully vaccinated can become infected with COVID-19,"" said Carr.

	Despite pandemic-related changes, Manitobans are still excited to have a Thanksgiving dinner.

	""It's the best. It's absolutely the best thing,"" said Stanton.

'There's quite a bit of scope to do this in a time of pandemic' legal expert says of vaccine mandates,"Oct. 9, 2021 9:52 a.m. CST","
     
     HALIFAX - 
     
    
	We have entered the phase of the COVID 19 pandemic in which the vaccine is being mandated and proof of vaccine being required at work, public places, restaurants and businesses.

	It has caused a lot of reactions and support for some outrage, and even some questions surrounding legality.

    Advertisement
    
	Legal and constitutional expert Wayne McKay, a professor emeritus at Dalhousie University's Schulich School of Law, says in most cases, mandating vaccines can be done and expects it would withstand any legal challenge.
        RELATED STORIES
       Mandatory vaccines are causing a flashpoint: but when does it cross the line?

	""There's quite a bit of scope to do this in a time of pandemic and crisis,"" MacKay told CTV anchor Paul Hollingsworth in an interview Friday evening.

	The key to a vaccine mandate withstanding a legal challenge depends on how reasonable it is, because rights are not absolute and government can impose reasonable limits on them and interfere with individual rights as little as possible.

	""People pretty well accept that given the crisis that is COVID-19, they have a legitimate objective to try to prevent the spread,"" MacKay said. ""So the only real question is: 'Are they doing it in a way that properly balances public health, to the general population and limiting individual rights as little as possible?' And as long as they do that, most cases where they are challenged, they're not likely to succeed.""

	While some call it overreach to mandate vaccines, MacKay says determining that depends on the facts of the situation.

	""If, for example, you worked exclusively from home and had no public contact and they tried to require you to be vaccinated, it seems to me that would be pretty hard to justify, and it's much more easy to justify it in certain sectors where there's a vulnerable population such as in hospitals or schools, for example, especially with kids under 12,"" MacKay said. ""So if they're protecting a vulnerable population, if there's a lot of public contact, then I think they probably have a pretty good chance of justifying it.""

	The other aspect of vaccines is the discussion around them – which has become pretty heated, especially on social media.

	The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees freedom of speech, but as with any right it is not absolute.

	""I've rarely seen such emotional and divisive, an issue is the vaccines, and as you say effect, particularly on social media that's played out in a pretty robust way, but free speech is not absolute,"" MacKay said. ""They've said from the beginning, you can't cry 'fire' in a crowded theatre, and I think that's really the bottom line. In exercising any individual rights, including freedom of speech, you have to do it in a way that does not interfere with the health and safety of the people around you.""

Northern hospitals 'overwhelmed' as B.C. doctors warn public to be safe,"Oct. 9, 2021 9:48 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Doctors in northern British Columbia are warning residents to be extra cautious to avoid injury, as hospitals in the area – which has the lowest vaccination rates in the province – are overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. 

	The fourth wave of the pandemic is being driven by infections in the Northern Health Authority, with dozens of patients flown to Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island hospitals to receive care. This week, the chief of staff at a northern B.C. hospital wrote an open letter warning people in the Omineca region near Prince George that their hospital’s emergency department could be shut down after staff – who were fully vaccinated – caught COVID-19. 

    Advertisement
    
	""Our hospital is overwhelmed and our staffing is compromised – I don't think that everyone in our community understands how easily the staffing of a small rural hospital can be compromised,” said Dr. Rebecca Janssen, a hospitalist and chief of staff at Vanderhoof’s St. John Hospital.

	“We are effectively begging people to be vaccinated and I hope that by expressing what dire straits we're in it does penetrate and people start taking this seriously, because I'm very worried for the community.“

	A CULTURE OF SCEPTICISM AND DISTRUST

	One of the MLAs in the region says he’s faced threats and there have been protests at his constituency office due to his vaccine advocacy, with an atmosphere of vaccine hesitancy and even hostility he blames on close proximity to Alberta.

	""Alberta has been, we've all seen, very slow to take the COVID-19 pandemic seriously and that really spread into our region,” said Peace River-South MLA Mike Bernier. “I've talked to a lot of people who say, 'If they're not doing it in Alberta, why are we doing it in British Columbia?'""

	Family physician Dr. Suzanne Campbell believes the scepticism and lackadaisical attitude toward vaccines was, in part, due to low infection rates and few first-hand experiences with the virus before the fourth wave.

	""I think it was a false belief that somehow we're protected by being in a rural community, by living on a farm, by not living in apartment buildings, by having more space that somehow we could avoid this,” she said, pointing out many people misunderstand of don’t follow guidelines when they test positive.

	“Now, we really see the explosion of cases and we really see the pattern of this person was sick and their close contact disregarded the pulbic health recommendations and they went to school or to work and a week later we get those two phone calls.”

	Earlier this week, the mayor of Pouce Coupe was stripped of some positions after questioning whether hospitals were actually full of COVID-19 patients, and a viral video of a speaker at a Dawson Creek council meeting was removed from YouTube for promoting vaccine misinformation, describing COVID-19 vaccines as a “genetic experiment.”

	COMMUNITY DAMAGE AS FEARS GROW OVER EMERGENCY CAPACITY

	Bernier warned the north is in trouble with so many COVID-19 patients, most of whom are unvaccinated, taking up scant hospital resources. 

	“I've gone and checked and we have zero beds right now and what scares me is if we have a traumatic situation, we have a car crash, a house fire, someone has a heart attack – we don't have beds in Dawson Creek,” he said. “I've confirmed with doctors that a lot of those beds are being taken up by COVID patients.""

	The warning was echoed by Campbell, who said Prince George and other communities are similarly strapped for health-care capacity.

	“Our emergency department is full,” she said, bluntly. “This is not a time to be doing high-risk activities, because if you get in a car accident, unfortunately all of the medical services we depend on might be delayed because the system is being overwhelmed.""

	Janssen pointed out that the north has the highest infection rates and lowest vaccination percentages in the province, a dynamic driven by misinformation and distrust in public institutions. That distrust is leading exhausted health-care workers to despair of their standing in the eyes of their neighbours and friends.

	""I had hoped that if local physicians would try to speak to the community, we would have buy-in because as rural physicians, we see people through some of the most intense times in their lives – we attend their births, we see them through their deaths, injuries, cancer diagnoses,” she said. “It is very troubling and very hurtful to see that trust isn't actually there and that, I have found very difficult.”

Canucks centre Jason Dickinson not afraid to speak up for what he believes,"Oct. 8, 2021 11:45 p.m. CST","
     
    
	Jason Dickinson isn't exactly sure where the feeling comes from.

	The Vancouver Canucks centre has a burning desire - a need, really - to stand up for what he believes.

    Advertisement
    
	“I don't know,” Dickinson said after a long pause when asked about that personality trait. “I just do.”

	The Georgetown, Ont., native stepped into the spotlight in August 2020 when he joined Vegas Golden Knights winger Ryan Reaves, who is Black, goalie Robin Lehner and then-Dallas Stars teammate Tyler Seguin, who like Dickinson are both white, in taking a knee during the American and Canadian national anthems inside the NHL's post-season bubble.

	They were the first NHL players in uniform to kneel in support of social justice and equality, and the first to do so during the playing of O Canada.

	“Black Lives Matter, equality, justice - you can pick the term, it doesn't really matter,” Dickinson said at the time. “Educate yourself, look into things, watch documentaries, talk to people.

	“Just learn, try to open your mind a little bit ... this is a big issue that needs to be addressed.”

	Acquired from Dallas for a third-round draft pick this summer before signing an three-year, US$7.95-million contract with the Canucks, Dickinson remains willing to voice his opinion in a sport where that's not historically been the case, including when it comes to COVID-19 vaccinations.

	“The vaccine works - it works,” Dickinson said bluntly. “There's a lot of people that want to argue it. And I guess that's their right, but there's a lot of people that are losing their rights right now by having to wait (the unvaccinated) out.”

	In the aftermath of taking that knee, however, he also experienced something new - vitriolic blowback, especially online.

	“Social media is tough,” the 26-year-old said at last month's NHL/NHLPA media tour. “People are a lot more willing to speak up because they never have to face (consequences), necessarily. You have a lot of people that will voice some pretty outrageous opinions

	“Pretty scary that some of these thoughts are out there.”

	Scott Walker, who coached Dickinson in junior with the Ontario Hockey League's Guelph Storm, said his former player's stance on social justice, and how he went about expressing it, didn't come as a surprise.

	“He didn't go out on Instagram the next day saying we should all be doing it,” said the former NHL winger. “He just does what he feels is right.

	“He doesn't push his agenda on anybody.”

	It's the same soft-spoken, driven Dickinson who helped push Guelph to the 2014 OHL title.

	“His belief system is his belief system,” Walker said in a recent phone interview. “He just does what he feels is right, and doesn't need attention.”

	And that's pretty much the approach Dickinson brings on the ice.

	“Consistency, reliability,” he said of his characteristics as a player. “Not flashy, but I'm effective.”

	The 29th pick at the 2013 NHL draft is also finely in tune with his strengths and limitations on a team that has the likes of Elias Pettersson and Bo Horvat above him in the centre pecking order.

	“I'll create offence, but not necessarily a ton,” said Dickinson, who has 25 goals and 63 points in 225 regular-season NHL games. “I'm going to be the guy that gets put out there in a big penalty kill situation or the last minute when we need to protect our net.”

	That responsibility in his team's zone is something he's had in his tool belt since minor hockey.

	“I've always worried more about the defensive end first,” Dickinson said. “My dad, my coaches always preached that to me as I was growing up. It ended up coming natural.”

	Walker described Dickinson, who he made captain of the Storm in 2014-15, as both “a quiet leader” and “a coach's dream.”

	“Low maintenance, can play all the way up and down your lineup,” said Walker, who played parts of four seasons with the Canucks in the 1990s. “Where he slots in for Vancouver (to start) will be different from where we ends up in Vancouver. They'll be able to use them in so many positions.

	“His hockey sense is elite.”

	Canucks head coach Travis Green said he's noticed an unexpected level of maturity from a player with a relatively thin NHL resume - albeit one that does include 40 post-season contests with the Stars.

	“He seems older than the games that he's played,” Green said. “He asks good questions, he wants to make sure he understands what we're doing, how we're playing, the type of system.

	“That's refreshing.”

	Growing up outside Toronto, Dickinson is ready for the roller-coaster of playing in a Canadian market.

	“When things are going well, it's good,” he said. “But you've got to accept that when things are bad, they're bad.

	“If you want them to love you (all the time), go to somewhere that doesn't understand the game.”

	Walker has little doubt Dickinson, who's dedicated his time to charities in both Guelph and Dallas, will make his mark on and off the ice in Vancouver.

	“I've got lots of respect for Jason ... he's just the greatest person,” Walker said. “Very conscientious, very caring, very thoughtful.

	“It's an unbelievable fit ... they got a good one.”

In the 24-hour period since the last COVID-19 update, five more people died from the disease, officials said. That brought the total number of local fatalities since the start of the pandemic to 2,001.

	Active cases increased slightly over the past 24 hours, going from 5,929 to 5,969. Hospitalizations, however, decreased by 13 to 360. Of those, 137 people are in intensive care, which is an increase of five from the previous day.

	Officials also said two new outbreaks were reported. One was at Cherington Place in the Fraser Health region while the other was at Haven Hill Retirement Centre in Interior Health. One outbreak, at the Royal Inland Hospital, was declared over. As of Friday's update, there were 17 active outbreaks in health-care facilities.

	The majority of new cases and hospitalizations continued to be among unvaccinated people.

Interpreting breakthrough COVID-19 cases in Manitoba,"Oct. 8, 2021 6:48 a.m. CST","
     
     Winnipeg - 
     
    
	As Manitoba continues to grapple with rising COVID-19 case numbers amid the fourth wave, vaccine task force lead Dr. Joss Reimer said Manitobans should not make too much of the uptick in breakthrough cases.

	Of the province’s 132 new cases announced Thursday, 37 were fully vaccinated.

    Advertisement
    
	Of Wednesday’s 95 new cases, 23 were fully vaccinated Manitobans and on Tuesday, 45 of the province’s 102 new cases were in fully vaccinated people.

	Reimer said there are a couple of reasons not to be alarmed at the number of breakthrough cases reported each day.

	“The first is that in Manitoba, most of us are fully vaccinated, and so the more of us who are fully vaccinated, the more of us who will be part of the breakthrough cases,” Reimer told CTV News.

	“So for example, if 100 per cent of Manitobans were fully vaccinated, then 100 per cent of our cases would be in fully vaccinated people.”

	Reimer said this larger pool of fully vaccinated Manitobans makes the numbers tricky to interpret. However, she said the biggest takeaway from the daily data is how many fully vaccinated people who contract the virus avoided hospitalization and severe outcomes.

	“Almost all of them are very mild, so we get very few people who are fully vaccinated ending up in the hospital, and almost none in the ICU,” she said.

	“There’s really only been a handful of people who after being fully vaccinated, got sick enough that they needed ICU care, and even then, it was shorter stays, they had lots of other major health concerns that made the vaccine less effective for them.”

	Saint Boniface Hospital Medical Microbiologist Doctor Philippe Lagacé-Wiens agrees breakthrough cases in the fully vaccinated are to be expected.

	“Nothing to be surprised about and it actually corresponds well to the degree of protection that we expected in the vaccinated population,” he said.

	“We know the vaccine is somewhere between 85 and 90 per cent effective. It’s simply a rule of mathematics that if you’ve got a much bigger population that is vaccinated, you eventually get close to parity between the cases in vaxxed and the cases in the unvaxxed.""

	Lagacé-Wiens said it’s reasonable to have group gatherings adhering to public health guidelines where everyone is vaccinated because the risk is very low. However, he says that might change as more cases emerge in the community during the fourth wave.

	He added the risk is more complex when adding even one unvaccinated person to a group gathering.

	“It's easy enough to say ‘only Uncle Joe is unvaccinated and that is only one person out of 20, I think it’s fine.’ Uncle Joe could very well be a problem if he's infected and then causes breakthrough infections in that group,” Lagacé-Wiens said.

	It says as vaccinations allow for looser restrictions, the COVID-19 infections among those under 12 are higher than at any other time in the pandemic and at least 20 per cent will have had the virus within two years.

	The study says children will benefit if a vaccine is approved for those aged five to 11 and that would help prevent the spread to unvaccinated adults.

       'This is no joke': N.L. woman's mom, stepfather fighting COVID-19 in intensive careN.L. recommends limiting indoor private gatherings to reduce COVID-19 spread

	Earlier this week, it appeared the provincial government was considering adding more measures to reduce outbreaks at faith gatherings. Premier Andrew Furey had a phone call with provincial religious leaders Tuesday, during which he discussed the importance of the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination passports.

	This came amid reports of growing community spread of the novel coronavirus in central Newfoundland -- a region sometimes referred to as the province's Bible Belt.

	On Wednesday, The Canadian Press reported that a couple who attended the First United Pentecostal Church in Bishop's Falls, N.L., were gravely ill as a result of the virus, while public health officials noted there were 56 active cases in central Newfoundland. The church pastor said he was fully vaccinated, adding that he hadn't told congregants whether they should or shouldn't get the vaccine.

	However, during Thursday's announcement, the province stopped short of the mandatory vaccine passport for faith gatherings. Instead, the government said it would permit faith groups to either implement the passports or cap in-person services at 50 per cent capacity, with all attending -- including ministers and musicians -- masked, bubbled and socially distanced, and with singing restricted to the choir.

	The new measures are similar to those in New Brunswick, which has also seen outbreaks linked to a Pentecostal church community. According to a spokeswoman for the Progressive Conservative government in New Brunswick, all faith venues must now require vaccination passports or limit their services to 50 per cent capacity, enforce masking and ""eliminate singing from services.""

	In Newfoundland and Labrador, there are varying levels of restriction for religious services. In the Baie Verte Peninsula, Boyd's Cove, New World Island and North-South Twillingate areas, gatherings are limited to 20 people with physical distancing. The remainder of the province allows gatherings of up to 500 people with physical distancing.

	Rev. Fred Penney, the pastor at the Elim Pentecostal Tabernacle in St. John's, said in an interview Thursday he was leaning toward the vaccine passport option, though he said he would discuss the matter with church leadership. He said it's possible that a passport policy might make people feel safer and attend church.

	He said the option of masking and social distancing would mean he has to wear a mask while giving a sermon and congregants wouldn't be able to sing -- both significant setbacks for his church if implemented.

	""I'm disappointed in this development, but I'm trying to be understanding of the government's position wanting to protect the population against a highly transmittable Delta variant,"" he said. ""As a Christian, we believe part of being a good Christian is loving our neighbour, and that includes being attentive to our neighbour's safety.""

	The pastor said he believes that churches shouldn't be lumped in with gyms, restaurants and other ""non-essential services,"" and that a universal, mandatory vaccine passport policy would have failed to recognize the special role of faith communities in society.

	""Should someone arrive at our church unannounced and in need of spiritual care and pastoral care, we would meet with them one-on-one. We wouldn't turn them away,"" he said.

	The province also announced Thursday that youth aged 12 to 18 are exempt from the passport requirement when they are participating in sports events at arenas and during indoor and outdoor practices.

	Health officials reported seven new confirmed cases of COVID-19. The province has 118 active reported cases and 16 people in hospital with the disease, including seven in intensive care.

	“Vaccines work,” Premier Jason Kenney said Thursday afternoon. “That’s why we introduced Alberta’s Restrictions Exemption Program or proof of vaccination system.”

	DO NOT TEMPT FATE THIS WEEKEND: KENNEY

	Kenney reminded Albertans the second wave of COVID-19 started after Thanksgiving last year. While he says the province has been making gains in the fight against COVID-19, with ICU admissions remaining relatively stable over the past seven days, that reality can quickly change.

	“Those gains are very tentative,” he said. “They could all be lost overnight, this weekend if Albertans do not carefully follow the public health guidelines.”

	“Particularly over the days to come, if you are not vaccinated – that is a choice that you have made – but please understand that you are at a much higher risk of both transmission, infection, and hospitalization,” Kenney added.

	

	

	The premier said that the unvaccinated should not “tempt fate” by socializing over the long weekend with people outside their household. Currently, public health restrictions prevent indoor social gatherings for those who are vaccine-eligible but are unvaccinated.

	“The health care system is still under severe stress,” he said. “I plead with Albertans not to read into some recent encouraging data a licence to ignore the public heath guidelines and restrictions that are in place.”

	As of 12:25 p.m. Thursday, Alberta Health Services (AHS) told CTV News there are 374 total ICU beds. Overall, 309 of those beds are in use, or 83 per cent of the ICU system’s capacity.

	The North zone is operating at 100 per cent of current ICU capacity levels. The South zone is at 94 per cent capacity while the Central zone is at 88 per cent capacity.

	The Edmonton and Calgary zones are at 81 and 79 per cent operating capacity, respectively.

	The Edmonton zone continues to have the most patients in ICU out of all zones since Aug. 18.

	Hinshaw added that last year before the Thanksgiving weekend, Alberta only had 92 patients in hospital seeking treatment for COVID-19 total, including 24 in intensive care.

	“Now there are 248 (in ICU),” she said.

	“We need all Albertans to have a safe Thanksgiving by having gatherings as small as possible.”

	PLEA FOR PREGNANT WOMEN TO GET VACCINATED

	During the media availability, Hinshaw urged pregnant women to get vaccinated to ensure they reduce the risk of serious outcomes should they test positive for COVID-19.

	“We have seen a continued rise in the number of pregnant Albertans admitted to ICU over the last month,” she said.

	Hinshaw reported that since July 15, a total of 14 women were admitted to ICU due to contracting COVID-19 – including eight pregnant women since Sept. 9.

	“While this may not seem like a big number to some, it is double the number of pregnant ICU admissions we saw in the entire first year of the pandemic,” she added.

	“We need everyone who is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or who has recently delivered, to receive the protection of both doses of COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. This is the best way to protect you and your baby from COVID-19.”

	As of Oct. 30, you will need more than just a mask if you want to travel in Canada.

	Wednesday, the federal government announced that passengers 12 and over who are eligible will need to be fully vaccinated when travelling by plane, train, or boat in Canada.

	The new rules also apply to all airlines and airport staff, all employees of federally regulated railways, and marine operators with Canadian vessels.

	The Winnipeg Airports Authority said it implemented a vaccine policy prior to the federal announcement, and all airport employees were already required to be fully vaccinated by the end of October.

	Vice President of Communications and Government Relations, Tyler MacAfee said it wants people who are travelling with them to be safe.

	“The trick now will be for the airlines to be able to validate that vaccination piece when you check in to get your boarding pass. So it won’t be a requirement right now to enter the airport, but to get on a plane it will be.”

	MacAfee said air travel accounts for a very small percentage of the overall cases in Canada, but these new rules are one way the industry can do more to prevent the spread of the virus.

	Train passengers and employees will also need to show proof of vaccination.

	In a statement to CTV News, a spokesperson for Via Rail Canada said in part:

	“Via Rail’s number one priority has always been the health and safety of its passengers and employees and the implementation of mandatory vaccination will contribute to ensuring that Via Rail’s trains and other facilities remain as safe as possible for everyone.”

	The federal government said it’ll be up to each industry to establish processes to verify vaccine status.

	It said there will be a short transition phase from now until November 30th where travellers have the option to show a negative COVID-19 test instead of proof of vaccination.

	On Wednesday morning, the prime minister and deputy prime minister outlined the new vaccine mandate, laying out the rules for travelers moving around the country by air or train to produce proof of vaccination, but ferry travel is exempt; this is in line with provincial exemptions from the B.C.

	“This fourth wave has made things challenging, especially for the families of children who are not yet eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, and certainly for our schools,"" said Education Minister Adriana LaGrange.

	Contact tracing will not begin until Oct. 12, after the Thanksgiving long weekend, and will be school-directed for at least a month, until Alberta Health Services has hired back enough staff to take over the work.

	Rapid testing will also be offered to students in schools with at least 10 cases of COVID-19. Parents will be able to request rapid tests from their child's school and can administer them at home. Six million rapid tests are on order, the province said. 

	The additional health measures are needed to ensure in-person learning can continue safely, said LaGrange, but critics say the province moved far too slow. 

	""Really, any measures they put in now is great, but they're really too little, too late,"" said Medeana Moussa with the group Support Our Students. 

	""The case numbers in schools were completely foreseeable and that this government took so long to act is another example of their failure in leadership and their failure to prioritize students.""

	A different approach less than a block away, where the owner of a popular cafe moved to take-out only when the passport requirement took effect.

	Customer's health records aren't his business, says Tarek Kostek, and policing the policy shouldn't be his problem.

	""And now we have to hire somebody to stand in the door, pay him two or three hundred dollars to ask for your ID?"" Kostek says. ""We can't afford that.""

	Increasingly, though, support for vax-passes appears to be growing.

	A National survey from Halifax based Narrative Research found 85 per cent want to see them mandatory for air-travel, and 78 per cent for live sports or shows.

	About three-quarters think passes should be required to get into a gym, and 67 per cent want them in restaurants.

	But all of that assumes you can easily get one.

	Visually impaired and mobility challenged, 68-year-old Wayne MacNaughton wound up asking Twitter for advice because the government recommendations simply won't work for him.

	""Well, that's great if you have a computer printer or an IPhone, but a lot of people don't,"" MacNaughton said.  ""And, certainly, a lot of the people that I know don't.""

	Buried in online responses, he wound-up getting a phone number, but says he'll wait a few days before trying to get through.

	Vaccine records still aren't required for a host of other services and activities, including retail, banking and church, but masks often are.

	The system is generally working pretty well. At least two patrons were quietly turned away at the Lions Head Tavern in Halifax on Tuesday.

	They were apologetic for not having their documents with them, but, as Duffy says, everyone seems to understand now there are consequences for not carrying those passports.

"B.C. adds 593 cases of COVID-19, no deaths as new vaccine requirement announced","Oct. 6, 2021 10:38 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	British Columbia has recorded another 593 cases of COVID-19 but no related deaths, the government said Tuesday after officials announced a new vaccine requirement for visitors in health-care settings.

	The latest numbers, provided in a written statement from the Ministry of Health, put the province's seven-day average for new infections at 694 per day, down from 702 on Monday.

	The seven-day average for coronavirus-related deaths, which hit a seven-month high of 7.29 last week, dropped to 5.86 per day.

	The number of infectious coronavirus patients in hospital increased to 345, up from 326 on Monday, with 144 of those in intensive care. The province only updates the number of people who remain hospitalized due to COVID-19 but are no longer infectious once per week.

	The unvaccinated continue to make up the majority of B.C.'s case and hospitalization numbers, according to the ministry, despite representing a relatively small and shrinking percentage of the population.

	Between Sept. 27 and Oct. 3, people who haven't received a single dose of vaccine were infected at a rate of 297.3 per 100,000 population after adjusting for age, compared to 35.1 per 100,000 population among the fully vaccinated.

	Similarly, between Sept. 20 and Oct. 3, the unvaccinated were hospitalized at a rate of 36.7 per 100,000 population after adjusting for age, compared to 1.7 per 100,000 population among the fully vaccinated.

	So far, 88.3 per cent of eligible residents age 12 and older have received at least one dose of vaccination, and 81.7 per cent have received both.

	Earlier in the day, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced that visitors in health-care settings across B.C. will soon need to provide proof of vaccination. The requirement is first being implemented in long-term care homes and assisted living facilities on Oct. 12, then expanding to all acute care and community care settings on Oct. 26.

	There are currently 19 active outbreaks in health-care facilities across the province, including one announced Tuesday at the University Hospital of Northern B.C.

	While only 18 per cent of the cases announced Tuesday acme from the Northern Health region, it has been experiencing a far higher rate of infections per capita.

	Northern Health recorded 30.6 cases per 100,000 population, compared to 14.9 in Interior Health, 12.4 in Island Health, 10.6 in Fraser Health and 5.7 in Vancouver Coastal Health.

	Getting two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine led to thousands of dollars in cash and scholarship prizes for 17 Manitobans as part of the second round of the province’s Vax to Win lottery.

	Crown Services Minister Jeff Wharton, Advanced Education, Skills and Immigration Minister Wayne Ewasko, and Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries President and CEO Manny Atwal made the announcement Tuesday morning at the vaccine supersite at the RBC Convention Centre.

	“We are extremely grateful and proud of the way Manitobans have stepped up to the plate to be vaccinated this summer to support the fight against COVID-19,” Wharton said.
	“As we are now in the fourth wave, it has become more clear how the vaccine has been a difference maker.”

	Seven adult winners were chosen including three from the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and one from each of Manitoba’s other regional health authorities.

	They each won a prize of $100,000.

	To incentivize people to get the COVID-19 vaccine, the Manitoba government introduced the Vax to Win lottery back in June.

	As part of this initiative, the province held two draws – one for eligible Manitobans who got at least one dose on or before Aug. 2, and another for all eligible residents who received both doses on or before Sept. 6. Manitobans were automatically entered when they received their vaccine.

	Both of these lottery draws offer three $100,000 prizes in the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, a $100,000 prize in each of the remaining health authorities, and 10 scholarships for $25,000 for Manitobans aged 12 to 17.

	Manitoba revealed the winners of the first lottery in August.

	As of Monday afternoon, 85.2 per cent of eligible Manitobans have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 81.1 per cent have received both doses.

	Once again, the numbers show the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated continue to make up the vast majority of cases and hospitalizations in the province, according to the ministry.

	Just under 65 per cent of infections recorded from Sept. 24 to 30 involved people who hadn't received a single dose of vaccine, a group that represents about 20 per cent of the province.

	The unvaccinated caught COVID-19 at a rate of 295.7 per 100,000 population during that period after adjusting for age, the ministry said, compared to 35.8 per 100,000 among the fully vaccinated.

	Monday marked the first day that students from kindergarten to Grade 3 were required to wear masks at school, including at their desks. Previously, the requirement only applied to students in Grades 4 through 12.

	Parents and teachers are hopeful the masks will help curb the province's recent spike in COVID-19 infections involving school-aged children who are not yet eligible for vaccination.

	Of the eligible population age 12 and older, 88.2 per cent have now received at least one dose of vaccine, and 81.6 per cent have received both.

	The province also began giving out booster shots to vulnerable residents of long-term care homes and assisted living facilities on Monday, a move that's hoped to slow the resurgence of outbreaks in those settings. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has noted that elderly populations can develop a less robust immune response after getting the shots, and residents in care were among the first to receive the vaccine during B.C.'s rollout.

	Officials also noted another 241 cases were identified over the weekend, 121 on Saturday and 120 on Sunday.

	The numbers over the last three days include 122 cases from Southern Health, 87 from Winnipeg, 48 from Northern Health, 42 from Prairie Mountain Health and 25 from the Interlake-Eastern Health Region.

	Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, said with the way cases are trending right now, Manitoba is heading down a severe trajectory.

	""Right now we are tracking on the severe scenario. So we are seeing case numbers go up, we are seeing significant increases in hospitalizations and ICU,"" said Roussin, adding that some health regions are adding to the COVID-19 strain more than others.

	The five-day test positivity rate is 3.7 per cent in Manitoba and 1.5 per cent in Winnipeg, with Roussin saying outbreaks throughout the province are leading to the inflated test positivity rate.

	""Certainly, transmission and test positivity in Southern Health is contributing a significant degree to that,” he said.

	“In other areas such as Northern, we have some localized outbreaks, which are contributing to significant test positivity as well, as well as in other regions.""

	He added that the Southern Health Region does have the highest test positivity rate in the province, but wouldn't specify what that number is.

	Roussin is encouraging Manitobans to continue to practice the fundamentals and follow the new health orders that will be coming into effect on Tuesday in order to help lower the overall case count in the province.

	While Roussin is calling on people to do the right thing with the new health orders, one southern Manitoba doctor isn't sure what impact it will have on residents.

	Dr. Don Klassen, a family physician and anesthesiologist in Winkler, thinks those who are unvaccinated will just avoid places that require vaccination requirements.

	He also doesn't think private gatherings will shrink with the new orders.

	""It does sound a little pessimistic, but I think that's the reality we have at the moment,"" said Klassen.

	Klassen adds, what does make him optimistic is that more than 81 per cent of eligible Manitobans have received both doses of the vaccine. 

	There are currently 814 active cases, and Manitoba has had 60,943 cases since March 2020.

	The province is also reporting two new deaths. Both of these deaths were men in their 70s from the Southern Health Region and both were linked to an unspecified variant of concern. One death happened on Saturday and one on Sunday.

	The province has recorded 1,213 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.

	Manitoba has 98 people in hospital due to COVID, 64 of which have active cases. There are 18 COVID-19 patients in the ICU, including 13 with active cases.

	On Sunday, 2,403 tests were completed, bringing the total to 1,014,482 since February 2020.

	Abigail Nicole, manager of Sidekick café in Halifax's north end, said she has been reading as much as she can on province's guidelines to prepare herself and staff.

	""I know it's tough for some people but there's only so much we can do. We're not police officers, we're not the government,"" Nicole said, noting her business opened during the pandemic and is already coping with staffing shortages.

	""There is not fear but I think there is a level of uncertainty in terms of what we're going to have to deal with,"" Nicole said.

	Nicole and her staff will be required to ask customers for proof of vaccine, and cross-reference their immunization card with a piece of ID.

	""Just make sure they are who they say they are and we can kind of get it over as quickly as possible,"" Nicole said.

	In Nova Scotia, public health is encouraging people to print a new immunization card that includes a QR code -- a new federal standard that became available for Nova Scotians on Friday.

	While CTV News tried in the morning and early afternoon to access the new passport and was unable to, by late afternoon, it was available after plugging in health card information and an email address at Novascotia.ca/proof.

	""It's the federal standard card and as of Oct. 22, Nova Scotia will implement VaxCheckNS, a QR code scanner app that businesses and organizations can use on a smartphone or other device to scan a paper or digital version of person's proof of vaccination,"" said Kristen Lipscombe, media relations advisor with Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness.

	Vaccine passports have been rolled out across Canada, including in New Brunswick.

	At the Old Triangle in Moncton, manager Todd VanIderstine said it wasn't a smooth start.

	""Just with people not being aware, those who disagree with it or just people forgetting,"" he said.

	While provinces are beginning to adopt a federal standard of a COVID-19 passport, that will eventually be used for international travel, it's currently a patchwork of COVID passes across the country—making some passes tough to recognize and the rules tough to enforce.

	""It scaled from something that looked like a word document to the QR system in Quebec to stickers to handwritten notes,"" VanIderstine said.

	Bruce Macfarlane, communications director with the Department of Health in New Brunswick, said the province isworking toward adopting the federal standard format that includes a verifiable vaccination credential in the form of a QR code in MyHealthNB. 

	""This credential can be used for international travel, with the potential for domestic use also,"" he said.

     REGINA - 
     
    
	Saskatchewan is asking the federal government to make efforts to acquire the COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatments or the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

	According to some studies, the recently approved antibody treatment could help slow the spread of COVID-19 infection inside the body if administered within 10 days of first being infected.

	Premier Scott Moe said Thursday he also plans to ask for more specialists to help health care workers in the fight against COVID-19’s fourth wave in addition to the treatments.

	“Are there other early intervention treatments that may be an opportunity for us to actually reduce the people that are going into our hospitals, just to identify people that may be at high risk of severe outcomes of COVID and offer those treatments to those individuals so that ultimately does reduce the pressure that we're feeling in our hospital systems,” Moe said.

	At a press conference Friday, federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Ottawa is willing to work with Saskatchewan, but it needs more details on how the treatment would be used.

	“We do have a supply in Canada. We also know that Saskatchewan has a supply and again, once we understand the degree to which they propose to use these antibodies and the timeline, we will have a better sense of how we can meet the need,” said Hajdu.

	The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health said a monoclonal antibody seeing regular use in Saskatchewan through the pandemic is tocilizumab, a drug administered in hospitals to patients with severe symptoms.

	SASK. JOINS CALLS FOR JOHNSON & JOHNSON DOSES

	Even with antibody treatments helping some patients, health care professionals say vaccinations are still the best way to protect against the virus, leading Saskatchewan to join with Alberta in requesting supplies of the single-dose Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine from the federal government.

	”Alberta and Saskatchewan are committed to working together to secure a supply of Janssen vaccine. The intent is provide it to primary health care sites or those locations where the single dose vaccine option would lead to an increased COVID-19 vaccination uptake,” the Ministry said in a statement.

	The federal government said the Janssen vaccine still needs to meet all required criteria for vaccine authorization.

	“There have been some studies that have come out to show that there's added benefit from a second dose of the [Janssen] vaccine to help boost immunity,” said Dr. Supriya Sharma, Health Canada’s chief medical advisor.

	Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam noted residents should be assured all available vaccines in Canada are safe, but if the Janssen vaccine is the only vaccine people will take, they’ll acquire some doses.

	“I think one thing that we need from the provinces, is a good estimation of the amount that is required. We do not want to waste any vaccines that can help other countries in the world,” Dr. Tam said.

	The federal government currently does not have any Johnson & Johnson vaccines on hand.

Plummeting HPV vaccination rate in Alberta a concern for health experts,"Oct. 2, 2021 6:26 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Members of two Canadian health organizations are raising the alarm about a drastic drop in the number of eligible youth who were vaccinated against HPV last year thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.

	Both the Federation of Medical Women of Canada (FMWC) and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) are calling on provincial and territorial public health services to prioritize HPV prevention.

    Advertisement
    
	The warning comes ahead of Canada's fifth annual HPV prevention week, which starts on Sunday, Oct. 3.

       Catch-up clinic for routine immunizations provided in schools to be hosted by AHSOpinion: How COVID-19 is creating lost cohorts for HPV vaccination in youth and why that matters

	Both groups said the pandemic disrupted HPV vaccination programs at schools throughout Alberta, causing clinics to be postponed, interrupted and cancelled.

	According to data obtained on the Government of Alberta's childhood immunization coverage dashboard, just 9.8 per cent of eligible 12-year-old girls received their second HPV vaccine dose in 2020, compare to 65.5 per cent in 2019. (Edmonton 8.7 per cent in 2020, Calgary 12 per cent in 2020.)

	For eligible 12-year-old boys, just 7.9 per cent received their second shot in 2020, compared to 62.9 per cent in 2019. (Edmonton, 6.8 per cent in 2020; Calgary 9.5 per cent in 2020.)

	Dr. Vivien Brown, past president of the Federation of Medical Women of Canada (FMWC) and chair and co-founder of HPV Prevention Week in Canada, said the numbers are concerning.

	""About 75 to 80 per cent of adults will have been exposed to HPV at some point in their life,"" Brown said. ""When you're exposed to HPV some of us clear it, the way we clear any other virus, but some of us end up with persistent HPV.

	""We know that persistent HPV can lead to six different types of cancers in men and women; the most common is cervical cancer, but we're also seeing anal cancer, penile cancer, vulvar or vagina cancer and head and neck cancers – or throat cancers.

	""For the last 10 years we've had a vaccine that is very effective against the HPV virus, so if we end up vaccinating – particularly young people, before they get exposed to HPV – we'll end up being able to eliminate some of these diseases.""

	HPV vaccines are supported by public health and provided at no cost. Youth in schools across the country are able to get the shot once they turn 12.

	Though there currently two HPV vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil, the one administered at schools throughout Canada is Gardasil.

	""Public health was completely overwhelmed with COVID-19. I think that is understandable. But because they were overwhelmed both in the amount of work and in the situation, the school programs were often stopped – and that's because school was stopped,” Brown said

	""They weren't being vaccinated in the school program suddenly.""

	Brown said there's been a huge number of eligible youth that have fallen through the cracks and have not been vaccinated yet.

	""There were some catch-up clinics that were planned in August and September in Alberta, but parents had to know to take their kids to the clinic,"" she said.

	Brown is suggesting parents of Albertans age 12 and over reach out to Alberta Health Services to find out how to get their child vaccinated.

	""If you're 14 and under you only require two shots – one and one six months later. If you're 15 and older it's three shots. So there's a greater cost to the province but there's also a greater cost to the individual of having to take an extra shot because our immune systems are not as robust as we get older,"" she said.

	The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) announced on Sept. 28 that COVID-19 vaccines may be given at the same time as, or any time before or after, other vaccines, including HPV vaccine. 

	""So if you're taking your kid for anything – a flu shot, a COVID-19 shot, measles, mumps and rubella, tetanus – they can get their HPV shot at the same time,"" Brown said.

	Brown said though many students in Alberta are back to in-classroom learning this year, there is still concern that those who opted to attend class virtually might miss their chance to get vaccinated.

	There are also concerns that the program could again be disrupted should students be moved completely to online learning as COVID-19 case numbers in Alberta continue to climb.

	Brown said though there were some parents who had concerns about the HPV shot when it was introduced a decade ago, they've proved unfounded. 

	""There was some concern when the vaccine first launched that if kids get immunized, are they going to feel that they can be more promiscuous because they feel safer? The research over the past 10 years shows the reverse. As we educate kids about HPV and about exposure they actually are less likely to be sexually active.""

	Alberta Health Services hasn't yet released HPV vaccination numbers for 2021.

	The Calgary Catholic School District said delivery of HPV vaccinations was shifted last year due to COVID-19 but they will be resuming in-school immunizations this year. 

	The Calgary Board of Education declined to comment by the time of publishing.

	The Manitoba government introduced new public health orders set to take effect next week, which will create new restrictions on gatherings for those who are unvaccinated.

	On Friday, the province announced it is moving back to the orange (restricted) level on the pandemic response system, after shifting to level yellow (caution) in August. This move will not affect schools at this time, and schools will remain at level yellow to make sure kids can remain in school as much as possible.

	""These new public health orders will allow fully vaccinated Manitobans to continue to enjoy as much freedom and as few restrictions as possible,"" said Manitoba's Health Minister Audrey Gordon.

	""Unvaccinated individuals will now be more restricted in their activities.""

	These new restrictions include:

	
		Limiting households to guests from one other household for private indoor gatherings when an unvaccinated person, who is eligible to be vaccinated, is on the property. This rule applies even if the unvaccinated person lives at this location;
	
		Limiting households to 10 guests outdoors when an unvaccinated person, who is eligible to be vaccinated, is on the property. This rule applies even if the unvaccinated person lives at this location;
	
		Limiting indoor public gatherings group sizes to 25 people or 25 per cent capacity, whichever is lower, for any gatherings that include unvaccinated people, who are eligible to be vaccinated. This applies to weddings and funerals;
	
		Reducing indoor group sizes for faith-based gatherings to 25 people or 33 per cent capacity, whichever is greater, for any gatherings that include unvaccinated people, who are eligible to be vaccinated;
	
		Limiting retail capacity to 50 per cent in the Southern Health Region; and
	
		Reducing outdoor public gatherings to 50 people. This rule applies to all gatherings. However, certain organized events for fully vaccinated people can get approval.


	Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, said fully immunized residents and those under the age of 12 will be largely unaffected by the orders. He said they will be able to hold private (household), faith-based and indoor gatherings, as well as weddings, funerals and indoor recreation, without gathering limits.

	NEW HEALTH ORDERS 'A CONSEQUENCE' OF DELTA'S RISK TO HEALTH CARE

	Roussin said case numbers, hospital and ICU admissions have been increasing – mostly among unvaccinated Manitobans.

	""Our health-care system remains at risk from the Delta variant, and these COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalizations are rising,"" Roussin said.

	""Today's announcements are a consequence of that reality.""

	Roussin said two thirds of all COVID-19 admissions to the ICU in the past week were first diagnosed with COVID-19 when they arrived at hospital.

	He said in the Southern Health region, COVID-19 cases could double in less than three weeks if nothing changes, meaning the region could see 93 cases per day.

	""That alone could place the province's hospital system at risk,"" Roussin said.

	Dr. Perry Gray, the chief medical officer for Shared Health, said half of all COVID-19 patients in the ICU are from the Southern Health region.

	""The vaccine has been an incredible addition to the health-care system. In fact, I consider it in the category of an incredible gift to all of us. And it is working,"" Gray said, adding the vaccine is surpassing his expectations.

	He said the province is not seeing large numbers of fully vaccinated patients in hospital and ICU. As of Friday, there were 14 people with active cases in ICU – 12 had not been vaccinated and two had been partially vaccinated.

	""Based on what I am seeing to date, if every eligible Manitoban was fully vaccinated, the impact on our health-care system would be no worse than a mild to moderate flu season,"" Gray said.

	Roussin urged those who have not been immunized to book an appointment.

	""If some of you are waiting until the proof of vaccine requirement is going to end, please consider the consequences of waiting,"" he said. ""COVID is not going away. It is going to be with us for years, and you are much more likely to get sick from COVID – especially severe illness – if you are not vaccinated.""

	“We have been on the frontlines since the very beginning of the pandemic and now are being told we are unsafe and unfit to continue working unless we are vaccinated.”

	Adopted in early September, Windsor Regional’s vaccine policy states that all staff, volunteers and students must have received at least one shot of COVID-19 vaccine, unless they have a valid medical exemption, by Sept. 22.

	Those who remained unvaccinated were placed on unpaid leave for two weeks.

	Failure to receive a vaccine by Oct. 7 could cost them their jobs.

	Protestors believe dismissing staff who are willing to work is not the answer.

	But Windsor Regional Hospital officials are standing by the policy. In a statement to CTV News hospital officials say:

	“Patients and their loved ones expect us to do everything we can to prevent the spread and/or outbreak of COVID-19 within our hospitals, to protect our community, patients and fellow staff and to lead by example.”

	The hospital says this position is overwhelmingly supported by the community.

	Between Sept. 21 and Sept. 27, people who are not vaccinated made up 64.9 per cent of confirmed COVID-19 cases, while partially vaccinated people made up seven per cent. The remaining cases, 28 per cent, were confirmed in people who are fully vaccinated.

	Meanwhile, most people who required hospitalization due to COVID-19 in recent weeks were not vaccinated, according to the Health Ministry.

	Between Sept. 14 and Sept. 27, unvaccinated people accounted for 72.6 per cent of hospitalizations, partially vaccinated people made up 8. 2 per cent and fully vaccinated people made up 19.2 per cent.

Sask. COVID-19 'onslaught' forces some hospitals to close ERs,"Sept. 30, 2021 9:13 a.m. CST","
     
     SASKATOON - 
     
    
	Hospitalizations and admissions to ICU due to COVID-19 have nearly tripled over the last month, according to the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA).

	More than 300 people are in hospital with the disease – a record high – including more than 60 COVID-19 ICU patients.

	“As COVID cases continue to increase, teams are working hard to move staff to where we anticipate the surge to be in the coming days and weeks. This means some communities are going to see disruptions to their hospital services, including temporary emergency department closures,” Derek Miller, the SHA Emergency Operations Centre commander, said in a news release.

	“We have already seen facilities experience these disruptions, and we appreciate all those involved for supporting our provincial response to deal with this onslaught.”

	Adult admissions into the pediatric intensive care will continue, as that department continues to provide care for COVID critical care patients under the age of 11.

	Unvaccinated people are six times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than a fully vaccinated person and five times more likely to be hospitalized, the SHA says.

	Those who are vaccinated in the ICU are typically older people with other pre-existing health complications. Unvaccinated patients in ICU appear to only have their vaccination status as the common denominator, the SHA says.

	The SHA says it is doubling its vaccine clinic capacity over the month of October to support a blend of bookable, outreach, and walk in vaccine clinics.

	“I cannot stress how critical it is that if you are eligible to get vaccinated, you must do so to protect young children in your household,” Dr. Johnmark Opondo, SHA’s Medical Health Officer and Offensive Chief for Public Health, said in the release.

	“We are seeing more children getting sick with COVID in households where adults and other caregivers remain unvaccinated, and they are getting COVID at home. In the last few weeks, one in five cases in children in Saskatchewan reported were under the age of 12. We must take responsibility and create a needed circle of protection for our children who do not yet have access to a vaccine.”

	The SHA says it has now opened 30 additional ICU surge beds across the province, up from last week’s 24, with plans to surge up to care for 125 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients while maintaining care up to 50 for non-COVID-19 ICU patients.

	It is also preparing to care for up to 350 COVID non-ICU patients through Saskatchewan hospitals.

	In the release, the SHA noted several ways health care is being affected:

	
		Service slowdowns including elective surgeries as surgical staff care for growing COVID hospital and ICU cases
	
		A 32 per cent increase in overall wait times affecting 33,078 people since March 22, 2020 until September 26, 2021.
	
		Patient transfers are expected to increase in the coming days to level load care across Saskatchewan hospitals. Patients whose care needs can be met in lower acuity hospitals will be transferred – but not necessarily to the hospital closest to home or at their preferred location.
	
		Acute care facilities and long-term care homes are experiencing increased restrictions based on current local COVID-19 risk of transmission.

"Nova Scotia to take 'cautious approach' in final phase of reopening; mandates vaccines for health-care workers, teachers","Sept. 30, 2021 10:40 p.m. CST","
     
     HALIFAX - 
     
    
	Nova Scotia says it will move into the final phase of its reopening plan on Oct. 4 as planned but will proceed using a ""cautious approach.""

	The province says while most restrictions will be lifted, some will be maintained.

    Advertisement
    
	Additionally, border restrictions will be implemented for people coming from Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.

       Halifax housing crisis: Municipality to set up emergency sites to address homelessness in the cityNova Scotia reports 41 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday; active count rises to 224

	Aspects of Phase 5 include:

	
		masks will continue to be mandatory in indoor public places
	
		physical distancing and gathering limits for events hosted by a recognized business or organization will be lifted
	
		the informal gathering limits of 25 people indoors and 50 outdoors will remain in place
	
		proof of full vaccination will be required for non-essential events and activities


	""The Delta variant has impacted our epidemiology. The fourth wave is taking its toll across the country and it’s now in Nova Scotia,"" Premier Tim Houston said.

	""We can lift some restrictions with the added protection of the proof of full vaccine protocol and our high vaccination rates, but masking and limits for informal gatherings need to stay in place. We’re taking a cautious approach so we can keep moving forward, even in the midst of the fourth wave.""

	Starting at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 4, proof of full vaccination will be required for people who are 12 and older to participate in non-essential events and activities such as going to restaurants, movies, sports events, theatre performances, social events and the gym.

	Based on conversations with people in many sectors, some changes have been made to the list of places where proof of full vaccination will be required.

	For example, proof of vaccination will not be required for general library access but will be required to participate in library programs that bring groups of people together.

	It will be required for designated caregivers and visitors of residents in long-term care facilities, with limited exceptions. It will apply to dining in at fast-food establishments, but not to takeout, delivery, drive-thru or food courts.

	Proof of vaccination will not be required under the provincewide protocol for employees of businesses and organizations that offer these events and activities, but it will be required for their volunteers.

	MANDATORY VACCINES FOR HEALTH-CARE WORKERS 

	Nova Scotia will begin mandating vaccinations for health-care and long-term care workers, as well as paramedics and teachers.

	Workers have until Nov. 30 to provide proof of full vaccinations. Those not fully vaccinated, meaning zero or one dose, must participate in an education plan.

	If an employee isn't fully vaccinated by Nov. 30, they will be placed on unpaid administrative leave.

	""Despite having a highly vaccinated population, the pandemic is still having deadly consequences in the fourth wave,"" Houston said.

	""There have been three deaths in the last week alone and we need to do whatever we can to make sure other families don't have to grieve their loved ones. Too many Nova Scotians have chosen not to get vaccinated, and some of them work with Nova Scotians most at risk from COVID-19. It is time to get tough.""

	The new vaccine mandate applies to:

	
		Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre
	
		workers in long-term care facilities (licensed and unlicensed) and home-care agencies (publicly and privately funded)
	
		public school teachers, pre-primary and other school-based staff, regional and board office staff, and those providing services in schools, including cafeteria and school bus services
	
		Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia
	
		workers in residential facilities and day programs funded by the Department of Community Services Disability Support Program and adult day programs funded by Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care
	
		workers in Department of Community Services facilities and those providing placements for children and youth in the care of the Minister of Community Services (excluding foster family placements)
	
		paramedics, LifeFlight nurses and some other staff at EHS
	
		physicians and other service providers to the above organizations; for example hairdressers and contractors


	""Our vaccination rate is not increasing as fast as we need, and we are seeing the impact of the fourth wave on those who are vaccinated and unvaccinated. There are thousands of appointments available for vaccination right now,"" Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health, said in a release.

	NEW BORDER RESTRICTIONS

	Beginning 8 a.m. on Oct. 4, everyone coming to Nova Scotia from other Canadian provinces and territories, including Newfoundland and Labrador and P.E.I., will need to complete the Nova Scotia Safe Check-in form.

	Their isolation will be based on vaccination status and testing. People who were fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arriving do not have to isolate, but testing is recommended. People who are not fully vaccinated must isolate for at least seven days and get two negative test results in Nova Scotia to stop isolating after seven days. They must be lab-based tests, not rapid tests.

	TAKE-HOME TESTS FOR CHILDREN

	Families of children in pre-primary to Grade 6 in Nova Scotia’s public school system will begin to receive free COVID-19 rapid testing kits in an effort to protect unvaccinated children and their families.

	The pilot program will see Nova Scotia provide 320,000 rapid tests to families and support early detection of COVID-19.

	""We’ve heard from parents that they are concerned about their younger children who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated,"" Becky Druhan, minister of education and early childhood development, said in a release.

	""These take-home tests are one way to provide families easier access to testing for children with symptoms and an added layer of protection on top of the core public health measures that exist in our schools.""

	In the next few weeks, schools will distribute the nose swab testing kits to families who want them. Each package will contain four take-home rapid COVID-19 tests with a set of instructions on how to complete the test.

Emergency room doctor frustrated by uptick in COVID cases in southern Manitoba,"Sept. 29, 2021 9:57 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	An emergency room doctor in southern Manitoba is growing frustrated as COVID-19 cases continue to climb, saying younger patients are ending up in the hospital, and people aren’t getting tested before coming in.

	The region makes up around 15 per cent of the province's population but accounts for half of all COVID cases, with another 17 added on Tuesday.

    Advertisement
    
	With the uptick in cases, Bethesda Regional Health Centre in Steinbach is admitting several patients a day to the ICU.

	""You know, a lot of patients are in their 20s and 30s and saying, 'Oh, I was confused by what I was seeing on social media, so I just didn't get my vaccine’,"" said Dr. Jen Anderson, who is a family physician in the area and also works at Bethesda Regional Health Centre.

	Anderson noted many people are showing up to hospital with serious symptoms, yet they haven't been tested.

	She said the reasons she’s heard from patients for not getting tested vary from not wanting to wait in line, not wanting to test positive so they can work, and people who deny they have COVID.

	""Even a year and a half into this, that reassurance that this could be COVID, and you probably should be tested – even if it is just to make sure that if you are doing okay, that you aren't passing it to someone else.""

	On Monday, Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, said restrictions for the area are possible.

	""So we're certainly not ruling out a regional approach. There are certainly challenges with a regional only approach, as we know there's a lot of mobility,"" said Roussin on Monday afternoon.

	Business owners who could impacted by regional restrictions are concerned about what will happen if they come into effect.

	""Mentally, it's pretty tough,” said Jeff Eidse, who is the owner of Sweaty Training and Conditioning. “We try to make a plan, we try to do what we can in between there, but uncertainty all the time,""

	Anderson said the best way to ensure the fourth wave doesn't last long is for all people to get vaccinated.

	""Ninety-nine per cent of patients coming into the ER are unvaccinated, so that tells us that vaccination is really helping this year,"" said Anderson.

	The Southern Health Region has a vaccination rate of 65.6 per cent, while 80.3 per cent of eligible Manitobans have received both doses of the vaccine.

	Protestors against vaccine mandates for school-aged children disrupted a Thames Valley District School Board (TVDSB) meeting Tuesday evening.

	The meeting was being held at Louise Arbour French Immersion Public School on Bellfield Street in London, Ont. when dozens of protestors showed up, resulting in police having to attend.

	On the agenda was a motion to write a letter to Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health requesting that the COVID-19 vaccine be added to the list of compulsory vaccinations for students.

	When CTV News London cameras arrived on scene protestors turned their attention on journalists with chants of “tell the truth.”

	In video captured by a CTV News London reporter, protesters can be seen shouting insults and yelling obscenities towards journalists.

	

	

	At one point, the meeting had to be adjourned while police worked to control the protestors.

	“Our role as the police is to be here to maintain the peace, allow the protestors to peacefully protest, while still allowing any meetings that are going on inside the school,” said Const. Buckle.

	Ultimately, the motion was withdrawn during the meeting due to a conclusion that the letter may not be necessary.

	“It is my understanding that the Chief Medical Officer of Health is currently reviewing this issue, and the Ontario Public School Board Association will advocate on behalf of all boards. Thus, I withdrew the motion,” said Trustee Corrine Rahman in a release.

	In a statement released to media the board noted that they have been dealing with anti-vaccine supporters spreading false information online that TVDSB was attempting to mandate vaccinations for students.

	“This is false information,” said Mark Fisher, Director or Education. “The Board has no authority to mandate student COVID-19 vaccinations and was never part of the agenda.”

	Fisher had described Tuesday’s protest as “disturbing.”

	Calls to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of compulsory vaccines for students have been growing in recent weeks. Toronto’s Board of Health has indicated that it will ask the province to add COVID-19 vaccines to the list.

	Health Minister Christine Elliott has not said if that is a step the government will take but has addressed the issue stating that the province will look at anything that could protect people.

	“It's a little bit frustrating that we haven't been given any information. We don't know anything, because the government and the SHA and e-health is not actually giving anything to us as a business to say, ‘this is what you need’ or ‘this is what to expect on Oct. 1.’”

	“We haven't been given any information, so we don't know how to redeem the QR Codes. We just know that people are going to show up and have QR Codes.”

	“I think we just got kind of thrown into it without that much information, where the information we gathered we had to seek for it right so we had to search for a we had to do the homework,” he said.

	“Before where the whole pandemic first started, we were getting notifications from the government or SLGA letting us know how we're going to deal with it or how it's going to be dealt with.”

	Dojo Ramen general manager Jiwan Choi says she’ll be at the entrance doing the QR Code scanning on Friday.

	“I feel like every restaurant has to make their own rules and processes about how they're going to implement this system,” she said.

	The Ministry of Health says businesses can choose their own methods of proof of vaccine, not just a QR code.

	They include:

	
		Wallet cards received at time of immunization
	
		A printed copy of your MySaskHealthRecord (MSHR) vaccine certificate (with or without a QR code)
	
		A screenshot of your MSHR vaccine certificate (with or without a QR code) saved to your device

		A COVID-19 vaccine printout from Saskatchewan Health Authority Public Health

Carstairs asks province for guidance on Restrictions Exemption Program at its arena,"Sept. 29, 2021 8:27 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	The town of Carstairs has decided not to implement Alberta's Restriction Exemption Program (REP) at its arena. 

	A council meeting on Monday evening saw councillors defer the option to the province, asking if they could instead use the program for some user groups but not for others. 

    Advertisement
    
	“When you go through the government mandates, we have to follow the guidelines” Mayor Lance Colby said. 

	“So we tried to do what was best, what we saw for the overall good of our community.”

	Because they decided not to implement the REP at the arena, youth sports groups under the age of 18 will not need to prove they have been vaccinated.

	Parents who want to watch their kids play are also not required to show proof of vaccination when entering the facility. 

	Instead, health measures are in place at the arena – including mandatory masking and physical distancing – and they are operating at one-third fire capacity. 

	Under Alberta Health's guidelines, adult sport user groups are unable to use the facility unless town decides to implement the REP.

	It's something that does not sit well with Carstairs Bruinettes player Marla Kimball. 

	“There’s a lot of pressure from both sides, and in this case, the minor hockey (side) – or the kid's side – won,” Kimball said.

	“I think the responsible decision is to go and get vaccinated, and I think that government is pushing for people to allow the vaccinated people to flow freely, whereas, restrict the unvaccinated people a little bit and put a little bit of pressure on them.”

	Kimball said her team has not played in two years, and though everyone on it is fully vaccinated they can't play unless the decision is made by the town to implement the REP.

	“I think the right decision is to put in place a REP at the arena and allow vaccinated people to use the arena and unvaccinated people to not,” she said. 

	Kimball says she’s concerned by low vaccine uptake in rural Alberta, but suggests it’s difficult to change people’s minds, once they are made up. 

	“I have nurses in my family, I understand the pressure the hospitals are under,” she said. 

	According to provincial statistics, 60.4 per cent of people in the Didsbury and Carstairs area who are eligible for a COVID-19 shot have had a single dose, while 52.9 percent of those who are eligible are fully vaccinated. 

	There are currently 108 active cases in the Didsbury, Carstairs and South Mountainview County region, according to the province.

	Carstairs Minor Hockey president Richard Herbert said he would like to see an exemption for the community to the REP as it would allow more people to use the arena facility. 

	Herbert admits that vaccines and COVID-19 have been very divisive topics for people in the community. and said having an exception for the REP at the arena would mean volunteers wouldn't be exposed to any abuse.  

	“It’s a big advantage, because we don’t have to ask a volunteer-based organization to police who's in that building, and if they are there for our event or another event,” he said. 

	Currently rural Alberta is seeing higher case counts per 100,000 people, compared to the large city centres. 

	About 25 per cent of Alberta’s current active cases are in the Central, South and North zones. 

	CTV News reached out to Alberta Health on whether they would grant the community an exception, but have not received a response. 

	The City of Lacombe has also decided not to move forward with a facility-wide REP at its arena, the Gary Moe Auto Group Sportsplex.

	To help mitigate that risk, residents will be offered a third COVID-19 vaccine dose, about six months after their second dose. For many residents, that means they will be offered a booster shot as early as next week. The doses will be offered alongside seasonal flu shots.

	Close contacts no longer need to quarantine and AHS Public Health is no longer notifying close contacts. Household contacts of positive cases are strongly recommended to stay home for two weeks if they are not fully vaccinated.

	A parent in Edmonton wrote an open letter to the province as her son became one of 69 out of 350 students at their school to test positive for the virus.

	

	

	Alison Turner is calling for the province to resume notifying close contacts to slow the spread.

	The Canadian Paediatric Society also sent an open letter calling for mandatory reporting and contact tracing in schools, vaccine mandates for all adults working in schools and childcare settings, and masking for everyone age two and up.

	Children are particularly vulnerable as Health Canada has not yet approved vaccines for children 11 and younger.

	However, Pfizer has recently submitted data for an initial trial for its vaccine for kids 11 and under to the FDA in the U.S., with plans for a formal request for emergency use in the coming weeks. 

	While there is no timeline for when a similar request will go to Health Canada, officials in Toronto have said plans are underway to roll out the vaccine when it does get the green light here. 

	Toronto Public Health announced Monday that it formed a COVID-19 vaccination planning group to get ready for an eventual rollout of COVID-19 vaccines for children in Canada.

	Since the onset of the pandemic, Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw has maintained that Alberta's schools are not a significant driver of spread and children are less likely to suffer severe outcomes. 

	On Tuesday, the ATA released a statement calling on Alberta's UCP government to introduce a mandate requiring all teachers and staffs in schools being vaccinated against COVID-19. 

	The Alberta NDP said it supports the ATA's announcement on mandatory vaccines to slow the spread of COVID-19 among unvaccinated children. 

	“It’s outrageous that the UCP is hiding information about COVID cases in schools from students, staff and families,"" Sarah Hoffman, NDP critic for Education, said. 

	""Everyone should have the right to make informed decisions about their own safety, but the UCP refuses to release the information that would allow Albertans to do that.""

	The province says 333 in-school COVID-19 clinics have been cancelled in Alberta including 88 in the Calgary zone.

	Alberta Health Services says the majority of cancellations was a lack of consent from parents but says it has been able to accommodate schools with less than 20 consents in an effort to reduce barriers to immunization and make it as accessible as possible for the school population.

	Anyone requiring a test for travel-related purposes is encouraged to review the COVID-19 testing requirements in other jurisdictions and plan accordingly, which could include seeking testing through private service providers.

Federal government prepared to help Saskatchewan battle COVID-19 fourth wave,"Sept. 28, 2021 8:31 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	The federal government is prepared to help Saskatchewan battle its fourth wave of COVID-19.

	In a tweet on Friday, the federal health minister Patty Hajdu confirmed she spoke with provincial health minister Paul Merriman and “ensured he knows the federal government will be there to help the people of Saskatchewan in this health crisis.”

    Advertisement
    
	“We stand ready to help wherever we are needed,” the tweet read.

       Sask. reports most active COVID-19 cases to date with 4,864Sask. NDP calls on province to ask military for help in 4th wave of COVID-19

	

	

	While the federal government is ready to help, Hajdu reminded Merriman it takes time to deploy these resources, and that equipment is easier to ship out than healthcare workers.

	“It depends on the resourcing needs of Saskatchewan, which is why it’s so critical that the province be looking ahead to what they anticipate they’ll need as they try to deal with the surge,” said Hajdu in a phone interview.

	She said the province has yet to make any official requests.

	Merriman’s office did not respond to an interview request, and the health minister last took open questions from the media one month ago.

	CTV News did obtain a letter from the minister to Hajdu.

	“I want to thank you for extending the offer that you have made in terms of federal assistance if the province of Saskatchewan requires it,” reads the letter from Merriman.

	“At this time, we have expanded the capacity in our acute and intensive care units in order to address pressures we are experiencing, and we will to continue to use the federal resources that have always been in place to complement those efforts.”

	Merriman did, however, request expedited approval for rapid tests and distribution of antibody therapies.

	 The offer from Ottawa comes as Saskatchewan continues to break COVID-19 records. On Sunday the province recorded more than 550 new cases, its highest new daily case count since the start of the pandemic. Those cases pushed the province to an all-time high of 4,864 active cases.

	Dr. Alex Wong, an infectious disease specialist, said this wave feels different than others.

	“People are just so sad and regretful they’re asking for the vaccine, they’re begging for the vaccine,” said Wong.

	

	

	Wong said the next two weeks will be critical in determining where the curve is headed, adding the biggest challenge will be healthcare staffing. He agreed with the federal minister that a proactive approach to securing resources is the way to go.

	""In no way shape or form do I think we’re even close to getting out of this,"" Wong said.

	""We need to have some consistent messaging in place about where we’re at right now and how dire the situation is.""

	Wong is calling on the province to introduce short, immediate measures to cut down transmission. He said those calls don't include lockdowns, but rather limits on gathering sizes and expanding contact tracing.

	The official opposition has previously called on Premier Scott Moe to formally ask Ottawa for help.

	The NDP says it’s time for the province to consider bringing in the Canadian military to help in many ways like contact tracing, testing and on the frontlines.

	Last Wednesday, the province said it is in regular contact with the federal government about the pandemic response. While it has asked for additional rapid test kits, there have been no other requests for federal support.​

"Alberta ICU staff say they're strained by rising demand for care, increasing backlash from patients ","Sept. 26, 2021 1:21 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	With Alberta’s health-care system now the focus of a military mission, the people who work within it say they're reaching a breaking point as stress compounds with negative patient interactions.

	Dr. Erika MacIntyre, a critical care physician working in Edmonton’s Misericordia hospital ICU shared with CTV News Edmonton how some patients – who usually are not vaccinated – are verbally abusing health-care staff.

    Advertisement
    
	“There has been some individuals who have accused us of giving them COVID,” MacIntyre said. “That’s always a bit of an added stress because that is not the case.”

	She recalled another time where one ICU patient, whose condition had improved enough to be able to leave the ICU, offered harmful remarks to the very staff helping them recover.

	“On the way out of the ICU, this individual called us killers,” MacIntyre said.

	“Despite people’s vaccination status, despite their health, we do the best that we can to treat the individual,” MacIntyre added.

	

	

	She said the worst stress on health-care workers, however, is the fact that no one knows when the situation in hospitals will improve.

	“No day seems to be the same as the one before,” she added. “Everything is changing.

	“It’s so much change. It’s hard to even know what form of change to talk about at this present time; the changes to staffing, to where we are.

	“We don’t know when this is going to end. We all expect it to get worse before it gets better. So we’ve anticipated that.”

	THE DEAD MAKE WAY FOR THE DYING

	The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) told CTV News in a statement that after being called upon earlier this week, up to eight ICU nurses and aeromedical transport for critical care patients – both in and out-of-province – are ready to be deployable “within 24 hours.”

	Surge capacity in hospitals continues to be added in ICUs, with occupancy 89 per cent yesterday to 83 per cent Friday.

	That reduction is not necessarily good news, however.

	According to Alberta Health Services (AHS), that six per cent decrease occurred as 18 surge spaces opened in the past 24 hours and some patients either recovered or died.

	“It’s tragic that we are only able to keep pace with these sort of numbers because in part some of our ICU patients have passed away,” AHS CEO and president Dr. Verna Yiu said on Thursday. “This reality has a deep and lasting impact on our ICU teams.

	“We are facing a fragile balance,” she added.

	As of 12:15 p.m. Friday, there were 368 ICU beds open in Alberta, including 195 additional spaces – representing a 113 per cent increase over the baseline of 173 normal spaces, AHS said.

	There were 304 total patients in ICU, the vast majority who are COVID-19 positive.

	On Friday, the Central zone operated at more than 100 per cent of current capacity, with 26 ICU beds.

	The South and North zones were operating at 89 and 87 per cent, respectively. The South zone has 36 beds while the North zone has 15.

	The Edmonton zone, with 158 beds, had 84 per cent of current capacity filled while Calgary, with 133 ICU beds, had 75 per cent filled.

	Dr. Paul Parks, Alberta Medical Association president, told CTV News that adding surge beds or capacity in one area means taking away from others.

	“It’s a bit of a 'rob Peter to pay Paul,' every time we add a couple of beds, we impact the system somewhere else,” Parks said. “The whole point is that it’s not infinite.”

	Opposition leader Rachel Notley said the CAF assistance requested by the province is helpful but the premier needs to go beyond medical evacuation assistance.

	“I think that’s helpful but I think that’s a fraction of what we need,” Notley said.

	“What’s really sad is that we are having to call on the Canadian Armed Forces, that we are having to call on the federal government and other provinces,” the Alberta NDP leader added. “We’ve allowed it (our system) to collapse to a scandalous level of incompetence. That needs to stop.”

	“At that point, it may show some significant difference (in ICU admissions).”

	According to Health Canada, the province ranks last in the country for vaccination rates. 

	Masri said low vaccination rates directly translate into what he sees in Saskatoon’s intensive care units.

	“Almost all of our patients are unvaccinated,” Masri said.

	“Our ICUs are full and we expect the situation to worsen quite a bit over the next few days.”

	Saskatchewan did see a bump in COVID-19 immunizations after Premier Scott Moe announced on Sept. 17 that a proof-of-vaccination policy would come into effect on Oct. 1.

	From Sept. 18-24, health-care workers administered nearly 25,000 total doses of vaccine – an increase of about 9,500 from Sept. 11-17. The average number of first shots given each day doubled, jumping from just over 1,000 to 2,114 the next week.

	“It won’t be until a good six weeks from now that they will be fully protected with the two doses of vaccine,” said epidemiologist Dr. Nazeem Muhajarine.

	“Six weeks in a Delta variant-driven surge is a long time.”

	Second doses also saw a slight boost. The average number of second shots per day was 1,187 for Sept. 11-17; that rose to 1,437 for Sept. 18-24.

	“Vaccination is an important way out of this pandemic, but it is not the only way,” Muhajarine said.

	“We also need several layers of protection.”

	Muhajarine said employee proof of vaccination should extend beyond government workers to places like schools and private corporations. He added, it is also time to reintroduce restrictions on social gatherings.

	Premier Scott Moe has previously encouraged businesses to follow suit in regards to the proof of vaccination requirements for government employees. Health officials have said they are monitoring hospitalization and new case numbers weekly, and further measures could be introduced, if necessary.

     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	The head of emergency medicine for the Alberta Medical Association, Dr. Paul Parks, says major components of triage have already begun in Alberta - an assertion disputed by the province.

	The dispute arose Friday as the Canadian Armed Forces prepared to bring in air transport and staff to deal with a COVID-19 crisis overwhelming Alberta's hospitals.

    Advertisement
    
	The province has yet to formally invoke the triage policy, which would see doctors have to make on-the-spot decisions over who gets life-saving resources.

	But Parks said it has become routine in hospitals in the last two weeks to have some critically ill patients - most of them unvaccinated COVID-19 cases - kept on main wards rather than in intensive care units on ventilators because they don't have the available intensive care ward staff.

	That's on top of previously announced mass cancellations of surgeries, along with patient transfers, as doctors balance medical needs with available space, he said.

	“We already are in positions in many hospitals across Alberta where the doctors know that it would be best for this patient to be in ICU and be on a ventilator, but we're not providing that option until they absolutely deteriorate to the point of crashing,” Parks said Friday.

	“We already are implementing some of these things that are drastic, and we wish we never would have.

	“People will suffer and will die by this.”

	Alberta Health Services said in a statement: “We acknowledge that we are operating at a reduced standard of care, however, safety remains at the forefront of all decisions.

	“Any patient who requires mechanical ventilation is currently able to receive it.”

	Parks said it's not at the point where doctors must make on-the-spot, life-and-death decisions. But he said that's not far away and, when it comes, the second stage of triage will follow quickly, including making those same decisions about children.

	Alberta Health Services said triage will only be invoked if all efforts to increase intensive care capacity are exhausted.

	There are 368 intensive care spaces with 304 patients, most of whom are critically ill with COVID-19, and most of them unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.

	Alberta normally has 173 intensive care spaces but has been converting other spaces, including operating rooms, into ad hoc critical care wards to meet COVID-19 demand.

	Alberta has more than 20,000 active COVID-19 cases and is seeing well over 1,000 new cases a day.

	Dr. Verna Yiu, head of Alberta Health Services, said Thursday a key reason intensive care wards have not been overwhelmed is because enough COVID-19 patients are dying to free up bed space.

	The number of COVID-19 deaths has been on the rise.

	There were 29 fatalities reported Tuesday, 20 more Wednesday and 17 Thursday. More than 2,600 people have died in Alberta since the pandemic began.

	Premier Jason Kenney has asked other provinces and the federal government for emergency aid.

	Andrew McKelvey, a spokesman with the Department of National Defence, said Friday that they have been asked to provide up to eight intensive care nurses, along with air transport for patients to other health facilities in Canada.

	The air transport should be ready to go in 24 hours and the nurses within 72 hours, said McKelvey.

	Parks and other physicians, meanwhile, are urging Kenney to put in a “firebreak” to reverse the slew of new infections, starting with shutting down schools and banning mass gatherings, such as sports events.

	“The (political) decision-makers upstream are not doing what they need to do to stop case transmission,” said Dr. Shazma Mithani, an Edmonton emergency room physician.

	“We can't keep going like this. Health care and ICU capacity is a finite resource.

	“The only way to stop the influx of patients into the hospitals is to stop the cases, and that has to happen with restrictions - and it is not happening.”

	Dr. Tehseen Ladha, an Edmonton pediatrician, said it makes no sense for Alberta to ask for federal help while refusing to impose serious health restrictions, particularly as cases among children rise.

	“This is the worst it's ever been,” said Ladha. “We're seeing the rise in cases amongst the (age) five-to-11 group go up faster than any other age group. The curve is almost vertical.”

	Dr. David Keegan, a Calgary family physician, said while critical cases grow, so does the collateral damage of thousands of delayed surgeries.

	Keegan said one of his patients needs cancer surgery, but the operation has been delayed.

	“It means by the time surgery happens you never know, (the cancer) may have spread,” he said.

	“Suddenly we go from this person with an easily treatable removable cancer to it has spread and we're into added-on chemotherapy and potentially radiation.”

	Dr. Ilan Schwartz, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta, said targeted public health measures and a vaccine passport may have worked a month ago.

	But he said only a hard lockdown with a shutdown of schools and on-essential businesses can now stop the crisis at its source - high caseloads.

	“It's absurd that we have (hospital) wards that are full, we are cancelling cancer surgeries, we're calling for the military, we're talking about transporting patients 3,000 kilometres in order for them to find an ICU bed and we still have society going on as if nothing is the matter.”

       P.E.I. reports three new COVID-19 cases Tuesday; will introduce vaccine passport on Oct. 5

	Although they are not currently in the province, they are still considered P.E.I. cases.

	The other three recently travelled outside of Atlantic Canada and are self-isolating.

	None of the cases are related to the outbreak at West Royalty Elementary School.

	There is a public exposure notification related to one of the cases:

	
		Sobeys Stratford (9 Kinlock Road)
	
		Tuesday, Sept. 21 from 11:30 am to 12:30 pm


	Public health says anyone who was at this location during these times should monitor for symptoms and if any develop, even if they are mild, visit a drop-in testing site.

	The province currently has 39 active cases of COVID-19 and has had 293 positive cases since the pandemic began.

	VACCINE UPDATE

	As of Saturday, September 18, a total of 251,706 doses of vaccine have been administered in P.E.I. meaning 93.2 per cent of the eligible population have received at least one dose and 85.7 per cent received two doses.

	All Islanders are urged to get tested if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19, even after a previous negative test, and to self-isolate until the results come back.

	Anyone age 12 and over can make an appointment to receive their COVID-19 vaccination at one of the public clinics online or by calling 1-844-975-3303; those age 18 years or older can also make an appointment by contacting one of the 28 partner pharmacies across the province.

	One new case was identified in the province's Northern zone, involving a close contact of a previously reported case.

	One new case was identified in the province's Western zone, and is under investigation.

	Public Health says it is closely monitoring all four health zones for community spread.

	OFFICIALS RESPOND TO RISING CASE NUMBERS

	With case numbers continuing to rise in Nova Scotia, and neighbouring New Brunswick reinstating a state of emergency, health officials continue to preach caution and vaccines to Nova Scotians.

	""We are encouraging people if they are not vaccinated to get vaccinated, it's the best protection that they have,” said N.S. Health Minister Michelle Thompson.

	With 169 active cases, the list of potential exposure sites continues to grow. Many of the locations in the Central Zone are restaurants or bars.

	""Honestly, I think it's a bit ridiculous for us to be listed as exposure site when we're only sector in all that list that has all these measures in place, such as contact tracing, such as the vaccination passports and they need to focus on other sectors that do not have as many restrictions as the restaurant/ hospitality sector,” said Luc Erjavec with Restaurants Canada.

	Dr. Robert Stang said Friday there are no plans to limit the hours bars and restaurants can operate, as the province did during the third wave.

	""That's why we're bringing in the proof of vaccine policy. Right now, we're allowing in with Phase four, limits on gatherings, both vaccinated and unvaccinated. Starting October 4, it will only be vaccinated people in things like bars, restaurants, gyms and a number of other discretionary operations,” said Strang.

	""We are in a very different circumstance in this wave where it is a wave of the unvaccinated which is why the vaccine passport or policy is very important,” said NS Liberal leader Iain Rankin.

	With COVID cases rising across the country, Premier Tim Houston said now is not the time to stop paying attention to Public Health.

	""The epidemiology is certainly changing and we need to be mindful and respectful of that,” he said.

	Health officials will make a final decision next week about whether masks will stick around when the province enters the fifth phase of its reopening on October 4.

	""If we look around the rest of the country where people have relaxed masking and then had to bring it back, I don't think people should be surprised if we continue to use mandatory masking in indoor public places beyond October 4,” said Strang.

	Meanwhile, the leader of the Nova Scotia NDP said the government needs to reach out to those who are unvaccinated and identify the obstacles they face.

	""Let us reach out to the places where people, identify those people, identify the support that's needed and see that the support's provided,” said Gary Burrill.

	COVID-19 CASE DATA

	Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 4,241 tests on Thursay. A total of 1,193,575 COVID-19 tests have been processed since the start of the pandemic.

	There were 3,577 tests administered between Sept. 17 and Sept. 23 at the rapid-testing pop-up sites in Halifax and Dartmouth.

	According to the province's online COVID-19 dashboard, there have been 6,486 cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nova Scotia. Of those, 6,222 people have recovered and 95 have died due to COVID-19.

	There are currently 14 people in hospital in Nova Scotia due to COVID-19, with one patient in an intensive care unit.

	Since August 1, there have been 590 positive COVID-19 cases and one death. Of the new cases since August 1, 420 are now considered resolved.

	There are cases confirmed across the province, but most have been identified in the Central zone, which contains the Halifax Regional Municipality.

	The provincial government says cumulative cases by zone may change as data is updated in Panorama, the province’s electronic information system.

	The numbers reflect where a person lives and not where their sample was collected.

	
		Western zone: 331 cases (9 active case)
	
		Central zone: 4,998 cases (129 active cases)
	
		Northern zone: 500 cases (22 active cases)
	
		Eastern zone: 657 cases (9 active cases)


	The provincial state of emergency, which was first declared on March 22, 2020, has been extended to Oct. 3, 2021.

	BREAKTHROUGH DATA

	Public Health reports 'breakthrough cases' weekly. A breakthrough case involves a person becoming COVID-19 positive two weeks after receiving either one or two doses of COVID-19 vaccine.

	According to Public Health, there have been 4,767 cases from March 15 to Sept. 23. Of those:

	
		133 (2.8 per cent) were fully vaccinated
	
		297 (6.2 per cent) were partially vaccinated
	
		4,337 (91.0 per cent) were unvaccinated


	There were 260 people hospitalized. Of those:

	
		6 (2.2 per cent) were fully vaccinated
	
		28 (10.3 per cent) were partially vaccinated
	
		237 (87.5 per cent) were unvaccinated


	Twenty-nine people died. Of those:

	
		2 (6.9 per cent) was fully vaccinated
	
		3 (10.3 per cent) were partially vaccinated
	
		24 (82.8 per cent) were unvaccinated


	VACCINE UPDATE

	The province's COVID-19 online dashboard provides an update on the number of vaccines that have been administered to date.

	As of Friday, 1,496,634 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered.

	In total, 80 per cent of the province's overall population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 74.1 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their second dose

	The province says it has received a total of 1,661,340 doses of COVID-19 vaccine since Dec. 15.

	All Nova Scotians are encouraged to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as they are eligible. COVID-19 vaccination appointments can be made online or by phone at 1-833-797-7772.

	COVID ALERT APP

	Canada’s COVID-19 Alert app is available in Nova Scotia.

	The app, which can be downloaded through the Apple App Store or Google Play, notifies users if they may have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.

	LIST OF SYMPTOMS

	Anyone who experiences a fever or new or worsening cough, or two or more of the following new or worsening symptoms, is encouraged to take an online test or call 811 to determine if they need to be tested for COVID-19:

	
		Sore throat
	
		Headache

Manitoba funds clinics to help Indigenous people get vaccinated against COVID-19,"Sept. 25, 2021 6:15 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	The Manitoba government is investing in helping increase vaccination rates among First Nations, Metis and Inuit people.

	The province announced on Friday that it is investing nearly $2.8 million to go towards supporting and expanding the roles of urban Indigenous vaccine clinics.

	The investment is in partnership with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO).

	Of the investment, $2.1 million is earmarked to extend the clinics at the Aboriginal Health and Wellness Centre and Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata location in Winnipeg until December 2021.

	Another $250,000 will also go to these organizations for mobile vaccine clinics which will operate in Downtown Winnipeg and in Point Douglas neighbourhoods which will include door-to-door outreach.

	Clinics in Portage la Prairie, Thompson and Brandon will also be extended until the end of the year with a $347,000 investment. Those clinics include the Portage la Prairie Renewal Corporation, Ma-Mow-We-Tak Friendship Centre in Thompson, and the Brandon Friendship Centre.

	A new staff position will open up at Ongomiizwin Health Services with a $65,000 investment. This position will be a liaison between the vaccine task force, Indigenous governance organizations, and vaccine providers.

	Lastly, $33,000 will go to immunization clinics that were held by the Manitoba Inuit Association that happened earlier this year.

	David Monias, Vice-Chief of the MKO, said he is happy to see the government is stepping up to help the Indigenous community.

	""We can only do this in unity, we can only do it together, to fight together, to protect our citizens, the most vulnerable people,"" said Monias.

	Mayor Brian Bowman added this is an important step in removing barriers for people to be vaccinated.

	""We're all Manitobans, we're all Canadians and our battle is against this virus,"" said Bowman.

	With the investment, the Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre and the Aboriginal Health and Wellness Centre are now open to all community members in addition to Indigenous people.

	The centres will also provide influenza vaccines in the fall and youth catch-up immunizations for anyone who has missed vaccines over the last two years.

	Della Herrera, the executive director of the Aboriginal Health and Wellness Centre, said this investment allows the centre to support those living in encampments.

	""Our goal is to visit every encampment under the bridge community in as many populated meeting hubs as we can over the next three months,"" said Herrera. ""This extension will allow us to provide QR codes and vaccine cards to our community.""

	Dr. Marcia Anderson, the public health lead of the Manitoba First Nation Pandemic Response Coordination Team, said as of Thursday vaccine coverage for people living on reserve is over 90 per cent, and added that only 16 per cent of people in hospital are First Nations and there is only one First Nations person in ICU with COVID-19.

Oilers' unvaccinated Archibald out 'until he can get up to speed': Dave Tippett,"Sept. 24, 2021 5:37 a.m. CST","

	When the Edmonton Oilers took to the ice at Rogers Place on Thursday for the first official team skate ahead of the 2021-22 NHL season, there was one player conspicuously absent.

	Oilers forward Josh Archibald made headlines on Wednesday when it was revealed by general manager Ken Holland that he remained unvaccinated against COVID-19.

    Advertisement
    
	On Thursday, the 28-year-old winger was left off the list for the Oilers team skate.

	When asked about Archibald's status on Thursday, Oilers head coach Dave Tippett said the forward ""just came out of a 14-day quarantine.""

	""No skating, no nothing, so until he can get up to speed with where the group is, he won't be with the main group.""

	Oilers captain Connor McDavid gave a somewhat diplomatic response when asked about the situation on Thursday morning.

	""The vaccine has become such a political thing,"" he told reporters. ""It's something a lot more than just a vaccine at this point.""

	""Obviously we want to do our best to protect one another, but ultimately it's everyone's choice to take it or not.""

	Archibald is the only member of the Edmonton Oilers who has not received a COVID-19 vaccine.

	""It's everyone's choice to take it or not,"" said McDavid. ""Everyone's responsible and has a choice and control of their own body and if someone feels the need not to get it, or doesn't want to get it, that’s their choice and you move on.""

	The topic was vehemently avoided on Thursday by Oilers goalie Mike Smith.

	""Way above my paygrade,"" the veteran goaltender said when asked about the vaccination status of his teammates.

	""I'm not going to talk about vaccinations, COVID. I want to talk about hockey… There's doctors that are way more knowledgeable about it than I am.""

	'BITTER TASTE IN MY MOUTH'

	At 39 years old, Smith's chances of taking home a Stanley Cup are dwindling.

	On Thursday, the Kingston, Ont., native said his team's Round 1 defeat at the hands of the Winnipeg Jets served as motivation for him to do better this season.

	""There was definitely a bitter taste in my mouth,"" said Smith. ""I proved to myself that I could play at a high level at my age.""

	""It kind of gave me the drive to keep going.""

	The Jets swept the Oilers before moving on to Round 2.

	After signing a two-year, US$4.4-million extension with the Oilers over the summer, Smith is expected to edge fellow veteran goaltender Mikko Koskinen for playing time in the upcoming season. 

	""At some point in the season you need both guys to be playing well and both guys to contribute to team success,"" said Smith.

	EVAN BOUCHARD 'CARRIES HIMSELF LIKE AN NHL PLAYER NOW'

	As one Edmonton Oilers' playing career draws near its end, another's is just beginning.

	With 21 career NHL games under his belt, the Oilers' 2018 first round draft pick, Evan Bouchard, still doesn't have much experience at the top level. 

	When asked about the 21-year-old defenceman on Thursday, Tippett's assessment of the young player was optimistic.

	""He went over in Europe, played half a year. Continued to play, continued to grow, mature as a player,"" said Tippett. ""He came back and probably didn't play as much as he'd like to play, but every day he was working with our group.""

	Tippett said the 2018 10th overall pick has been spending extra time in practice and attends every meeting.

	""He understands what we're doing as a team,"" said Tippett. ""This year, the difference that I see in him, he's gone from being a young player to he looks like a man… He carries himself like an NHL player now.""

	When asked about his previous NHL season, during which he played in only 14 games, Bouchard called it a ""learning experience.""

	""Now having the opportunity to slot in. It's going to be a big camp for me and I'm going to show what I can do.

	The young player said training with fellow Oilers' defenceman Darnell Nurse on smaller ice surfaces over the offseason was a good opportunity to get better. 

	""(Nurse) is one of the hardest working guys I know,"" said Bouchard. 

	""Getting the opportunity to skate with him, see how hard he works, and I think being on the smaller ice was good for the two of us being a bit bigger, you know, really working on your quick feet and get into the smaller zones really helps a lot.""

	For Bouchard, the hope is that hard work pays off going into this season.

	""We're going to give him a great opportunity,"" said Tippett. ""We need him to take a step forward for us and I have full confidence that he's going to do that.""

	The Oilers next big test will be against the Calgary Flames when they faceoff for their first pre-season game on Sunday.

Alberta food court operators call on province to remove closures and allow indoor dining ,"Sept. 24, 2021 9:51 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Food court operators in Alberta say they are being unfairly targeted after the province ordered their businesses to ban all indoor dining.

	The original plan announced on Friday from the UCP government was to allow all eateries to use the Restrictions Exemption Program and require proof of vaccination for all customers, but that messaging changed over the weekend.

    Advertisement
    
	“We feel that food courts were singled out in the province by removing the seating on very short notice, as early as Saturday morning in some places,” said co-founder of 98 Food Co., Jason Cunningham.

	“All the national landlords were preparing to have security checks for vaccine proof.”

	Cunningham operates a wide variety of food outlets in Calgary and says it makes no sense for the province to allow customers to dine in at restaurants, while at the same time closing food courts.

	“We don't think they're very social environments like a late-night restaurant, there's no alcohol served at our establishments,” he said.

	“There are socially-distanced tables and chairs often fixed to the floor. People visit the food court for 15 or 20 minutes as food on the go, yet you can go to a white tablecloth dining room and sit there for five hours if you like -- we don't think that's fair at all.”

	Takeout service is still allowed for food court operators, but Cunningham says sales could be impacted by as much as 80 per cent as work from home orders are implemented.

	He added that rents for food court operators are amongst the highest per square foot than any other food service in the province.

	“Don't penalize them at all, open up food courts so not only the small businesses can manage better, but it gives lower income families an equal opportunity to go out and dine as well.”

	B.C. FOOD COURTS REMAIN OPEN

	No dates have been given by the Alberta Government as to when food courts could re-open, but other provinces like British Columbia have opted to keep food courts open.

	In B.C., food courts are not only allowed to stay open, but also considered safer because they are considered takeout services and therefore exempted from requiring proof of vaccination.

	General Manager of CF Market Mall, Darren Milne said his mall was prepared to implement the Restrictions Exemption Program, which would see attendants request proof of vaccination at both of the food courts entrances.

	Milne said that option has been rejected and has since made it more difficult to control crowding at the mall.

	“People just find other places in the mall to go eat and so we're finding people eating in back hallways or in stairwells or on the floor,” he said.

	“When that happens we can't control the number of people who are together, we can't control the garbage and we can't control the sanitization of the tables or the areas of eating, so we think it's really important for food court seating to be open.”

	'WE’RE HUGELY IMPACTED': CALGARY FARMERS’ MARKET 

	The Calgary Farmers’ Market South has also been impacted by the move as it was forced to remove all 60 of its tables in its food hall, which could hold up to 250 people at any given time.

	Brittany Fitzgerald is the facility’s marketing and operations coordinator and says 25 family businesses are now seeing a huge reduction in sales.

	“A food court is specifically for fast food and our food hall is all for family run businesses just like any restaurant,” she said.

	“In the past, we've had to work with previous government regulations, we've had our tables spaced out six feet apart, and we've always followed all health protocols so this doesn’t make sense.”

	Phil Faba, who owns the Stock and Sauce Company within the farmers' market, noted that his livelihood is dependent on customers coming in and dining in person.

	“There is no traffic over here, there are businesses directly near the food hall and feeling it, so we have a down profit right now of about 30 to 50 per cent every time we shut down,” Faba said.

	“We’re being penalized just for the situation that we're in, but if I owned my own restaurant, I'd have the same ability as every other restaurant to serve customers dine-in service.”

	PROVINCE RESPONDS TO FOOD COURT OPERATORS

	CTV News contacted Alberta Health for an explanation on why food courts and food halls were closed, while dine-in service for restaurants remained open under the Restrictions Exemption Program.

	The following response from Tom McMillan, Alberta Health assistant director of communications did not specify why food courts were singled out. 

	“Indoor dining, including food courts, was closed as these settings are places where individuals are removing masks and in close contact for a long duration of time,” McMillan’s statement read.

	“At this time, food courts are open to takeout only. They remain closed for in-person dining due to the open-access nature of mall food courts and typically the lack of attendants who can ensure public health measures and other requirements are followed.”

	“We appreciate businesses and patrons’ patience as we continue to respond to COVID-19 and adjust our approach in Alberta if and as needed to protect the health care system and bend down the curve once again.”

NHLers weigh in on league's vaccine policy: 'I've gotta be careful with this one',"Sept. 25, 2021 5:51 a.m. CST","
     
    
	Nick Suzuki doesn't think he's ever skated faster.

	The Montreal Canadiens centre had played 61 consecutive regular-season and playoff contests inside cavernous arenas devoid of spectators.

    Advertisement
    
	Then things changed, if only a little. But it certainly meant more than Suzuki could have ever imagined.

	The Quebec government lifted some of its COVID-19 restrictions -- among them a province-wide curfew -- in late May, allowing the Canadiens to welcome 2,500 fans into the Bell Centre for Game 6 of their first-round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs.

       NHL camps open as teams take stock of unvaccinated playersNHL expects 98 per cent of players to be vaccinated before seasonNHL to punish unvaccinated players more harshly this seasonNHLer Tyler Bertuzzi is only unvaccinated Detroit Red Wings player, will miss games in Canada

	""I felt unbelievable,"" Suzuki said of playing in front of just 12 per cent capacity. ""The energy that they created for us was amazing.

	""I don't know how we played without them, to be honest.""

	It was a long winter and spring of 2021 for NHL players and fans in Canada. While arenas in the U.S. gradually opened as coronavirus vaccine rates ramped up, venues stayed almost entirely shut north of the border thanks to a slower rollout and more stringent regulations.

	Montreal beat Toronto in overtime in that first NHL game in Canada with paying fans since March 2020, and after winning Game 7 on the road two nights later to complete the comeback from a 3-1 series deficit, would again suit up in front of 2,500 supporters twice in the Canadiens' equally surprising second-round sweep of the Winnipeg Jets.

	Attendance was boosted to 3,500 fans for both the third round against the Vegas Golden Knights and the Stanley Cup final with the Tampa Bay Lightning, who downed Montreal in five games for their second straight title.

	""I kind of felt numb because we didn't have fans for such a long period,"" Suzuki said looking back on that first night when faces returned to the crowd. ""I was like, 'Maybe it's the same.'

	""Then all of a sudden we had them back ... it changes the whole atmosphere.""

	Canadian NHL teams are set for fans to return this season as the league resumes an 82-game schedule and its regular division setup.

	The seven franchises only played against each other until the semifinals last season because of border restrictions, meaning blaring music and artificial noise took the place of 20,000 voices inside arenas.

	""Definitely excited to have the fans back in the building,"" Calgary Flames winger Andrew Mangipane said.

	""And not hearing the fake crowd noise.""

	Toronto welcomes Montreal to Scotiabank Arena in exhibition play Saturday -- Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment announced Friday capacity will be 50 per cent after Ontario loosened restrictions -- for the venue's first event with paying customers since March 10, 2020.

	""Oh my God, we missed it so much,"" Toronto winger William Nylander said. ""You know how much the team loves the fans, what the fans mean to us, and what we mean to the fans.

	""It'll be so nice to have them back.""

	The Leafs and Ottawa Senators hope to host capacity crowds for their regular-season openers, while the Jets also expect to play in front of full houses this season.

	The Flames and Edmonton Oilers are currently allowed to fill their arenas despite Alberta being under a state of public health emergency due to a COVID-19 surge.

	The Vancouver Canucks are limited to 50 per cent capacity, but the team has said it hopes restrictions will be eased. Montreal is permitted to play in front of 33 per cent capacity as things stand.

	Each NHL rink in Canada will require proof of vaccination for fans to attend, save for Edmonton's Rogers Place, which is also accepting a negative COVID-19 test.

	Players were asked repeatedly before the pandemic-shortened season how they would deal with the empty buildings. Most put on a brave face and talked about being professionals with the ability to self-motivate, but it was more difficult than expected in a jam-packed season with little downtime.

	""(Picture) a Monday night (in Vancouver), and no fans and you're tired,"" Canadiens winger Tyler Toffoli said. ""You know that you have to fly six hours after the game. You're just dreading that. You need that extra little motivation ... it was definitely tough.

	""Mentally, it was the hardest year of my entire career.""

	Canucks goalie Thatcher Demko said some NHLers might have taken what the boisterous crowds bring for granted before the pandemic.

	""It put a lot of perspective in the minds of the players as far as what the fans mean to the game,"" he said.

	Winnipeg centre Mark Scheifele found the lack of crowd-influenced momentum swings noticeable both at home and on the road.

	""A big save or a blocked shot or a big goal ... there's only a goal horn,"" he said. ""You don't get the full appreciation.""

	""It can be a little hit on the boards and people are going nuts,"" Oilers defenceman Darnell Nurse added. ""You don't know how much you miss it until you don't have fans.""

	Jets head coach Paul Maurice said the situation even impacted the people standing behind the bench.

	""We were truly segregated,"" he said of last season. ""And what did we learn? We learned that we need our fans to enjoy our job -- we truly do.

	""I didn't enjoy parts of my job that I always used to love, and that's games. I love going to the rink. And there's nobody in the building and you're going kind of like, 'What are we doing? This is no fun.'

	""It was just no fun.""

	Winnipeg centre Pierre-Luc Dubois does his best to ignore the crowd, but noticed a difference as last season ground on.

	""Teams did the best they could,"" he said. ""But there's nothing like a fan borderline giving you the finger, slamming on the glass and telling you that you suck. There's nothing like hearing that sometimes.

	""That's definitely something I missed.""

	He finally got to experience it again at the Bell Centre during the playoffs.

	""I was in the penalty box and the fans are chanting my name to mock me,"" Dubois recalled. ""But little did they know, I had a smile on my face.

	""I'm like, 'Ah, they're back. Finally, we're back.""'

	And that was just the start.

	Officials in Guelph issued an open letter to students on Thursday urging them to avoid large gatherings in the wake of a ""worrying trend"" of on-campus parties.

       Two teens arrested at gathering of hundreds on University of Guelph campus: police

	There have been two confirmed large gatherings on campus at the University of Guelph since the school year began. Two teenagers were arrested at a gathering this past weekend, although neither were students.

	The university's home opener football game is this Saturday.

	The letter reiterates that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, adding students can do their part to protect themselves and others from infection.

	""Being vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself from the most serious outcomes of COVID-19 and its many variants. However, no vaccine is 100-per-cent effective. Without taking other precautions, you can still become infected and infect others who may be more vulnerable to serious illness,"" the letter states.

	On top of avoiding large parties, students are being reminded to physically distance and wear masks, even outside, when a two metre distance cannot be maintained.

	""Avoid large gatherings, especially if you don’t know who is vaccinated and who is not. Drinking, eating, shouting and singing in crowded spaces all increase the odds of transmission,"" the letter said. ""Reconsider your party plans. Socialize in small groups and with people you know. Stay home if you are unwell.""

	The letter also reminds students of the consequences associated with hosting parties over the COVID-19 limits. Hosts of large gatherings can be fined up to $10,000 and attendees $880. Noise and nuisance tickets can range from $365 to $615.

	The University of Guelph's non-academic misconduct policy applies to behaviour on and off-campus. Defying that policy can result in fines, non-academic probation, suspension and eviction from residence, the letter states.

	""Do not put yourself, or the in-person school year we want to offer you, at risk. We have all done so well in the past 18 months to slow the spread of COVID-19,"" the letter concludes. ""Let’s continue being vigilant so we can fully reopen our campus and community.""

'No margin for error': Albertans look for immediate impact from restrictions as COVID-19 cases climb ,"Sept. 24, 2021 9:01 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	As Alberta's latest round of COVID-19 health measures take hold, experts are predicting a dicey stretch — but there is reason to believe case numbers could soon decrease.

	The number of daily new cases reported has been above 1,300 for two and a half weeks, but the rolling average is somewhat levelling off.

	Infectious disease expert Dr. Craig Jenne says he's hoping new rules around masking and mandatory vaccination will make an even bigger dent on the figures.

	""We simply have no margin for error,"" he said. ""There's no room, no care left. We need to make sure these numbers stop rising and begin to decline rapidly.""

	The province's health care system has taken a major hit in September. 

	COVID-19 patients are flooding the facilities and surge capacity is quickly filling. 

	Help is on the way from Ottawa, but even as case numbers climb, Albertans will likely still be facing another week of growing hospital admissions.

	Hospitalizations are a lagging indicator, which means they'll take longer to be impacted by the new restrictions. But, in other jurisdictions, similar health measures were able to bring hospital admissions and ICU numbers to a manageable level. 

	In British Columbia, rapidly-climbing cases were all but levelled out by a strict vaccine passport mandate. 

	Alberta's newest round of rules are less stringent, but experts believe they'll still have an effect on what is becoming a dire situation. 

	""(Alberta's) rate of growth has declined to, instead of five or six per cent a day, down to two per cent a day,"" said Dean Karlen of the B.C. Modelling Group.

	""So that's in the right direction. In British Columbia, we were growing at two per cent a day about a month ago. Now we're down to zero.""

	Still, Jenne says there's no reason to become complacent. 

	""We're hoping that this means we're starting to plateau,"" he told CTV News. ""But this plateau is still unmanageably high.""

	Athletes and staff would have to opportunity to obtain a medical or religious exemption to the mandate, the USOPC said.

	Hirshland said the USOPC had hoped COVID-19 restrictions would be lifted by the end of the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games but in reality the pandemic is ""far from over.""

	""This step will increase our ability to create a safe and productive environment for Team USA athletes and staff, and allow us to restore consistency in planning, preparation and service to athletes,"" she said.

	The move has the support of the Athletes' Advisory Council and National Governing Bodies Council, she said, which was further reinforced by the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the Pfizer vaccine and the recent mandates by the U.S. federal government.

"Alberta carnivals, festivals permitted during public health emergency ","Sept. 24, 2021 5:40 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	As health-care workers struggle with a fourth wave of COVID-19 patients, other Albertans are able to go to weekend carnivals and festivals sanctioned by health officials and approved by the UCP government. 

	A state of public health emergency was declared by Premier Jason Kenney on Sept. 15 as patients requiring intensive care hit all-time record numbers.

    Advertisement
    
	Still, in an effort to keep the economy going, Alberta is allowing businesses including festivals and carnivals to continue outdoors without vaccine rules – causing confusion and drawing criticism from some.

	Responding to concern from residents, Slave Lake’s mayor clarified that he had no say in the carnival setting up in his town this week, because it’s happening on private land.

	“This approval does not go through council!! My understanding is they have approval from AHS and it is up to AHS to monitor and enforce in the event. It is my hope that AHS does so. You should not expect to see me at a carnival this weekend,” Tyler Warman wrote on Facebook.

	A commenter on the post called the event “dangerous,” and another said it was “surprising” that this was being allowed.



	

	Others were happy that Wild Rose Shows Inc. was setting up in town.

	“Don’t go if you’re worried,” commenter Jim Buchholtz wrote on a Town of Slave Lake post explaining the situation.

	Wild Rose also had a show scheduled for Sept. 23-26 in Red Deer.

	An employee told CTV News Edmonton over the phone that they were trying to save a family business after months of being shut down.

	A spokesperson with the company did not return a request for further comment.

	Alberta Health confirmed carnivals and other outdoor events are still allowed, and do not require special approval provided “social distancing is maintained between households.”

	Outdoor events also do not require vaccine passports and there is no limit on capacity.

	Several other festivals were also still scheduled to proceed through the health emergency.

	The Lethbridge Electronic Music Festival was planned for Saturday in downtown Lethbridge and the Heritage Inn International Balloon Festival was still a go in High River.

	Organizers of both events did have to change plans to allow for the outside 2m distancing rule, their advertisements said.

	The Edmonton International Film Festival planned to push on too. Running Oct. 1-10, organizers clarified safety rules in a Facebook post.

	“We’re making it safer and more intimate while creating more space and keeping the same excitement and togetherness that guests have come to expect from a visit to the cinemas,” it read.

	“All attendees will be asked to adhere to the health and safety guidelines that we’ve developed, along with public health requirements.”

	Alberta announced 20 new COVID-19 related deaths Wednesday and Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province’s chief medical officer of health repeated similar health advice.

	“Our actions, such as going out while symptomatic, have very real consequences to those around us. Staying home when we feel unwell, wearing our masks when out in public, & getting vaccinated are critical to limiting the potential spread,” she wrote on Twitter.

	‘Madness’ to still allow big events: Gibney

	“If you look at where we are…we’re in a crisis like we’ve never been in before. We’re begging other provinces to help us take ICU patients,” Dr. Noel Gibney, a medical professor at the University of Alberta, said Thursday.

	Alberta was seeing record numbers of hospitalizations and ICU patients, and the province’s death rate from COVID-19 was the highest in Canada.

	Gibney believes outdoor events are not overly dangerous for COVID-19 transmission, if everyone follows the rules, but said the message it sends to allow parties to continue during a fourth wave was not helping Alberta.

	“The Stampede wasn’t a risk outdoors in the Stampede grounds. The problem is when people celebrate, they go out to the festival in the day time and then they go out to the bars and restaurants at night. And that’s where the trouble happens, when people come together indoors,” he said.

	“If we don’t have the message sent that we’re in a crisis, people are just going to carry on with their lives as if nothings happening until their family member gets sick. Even if they don’t get Covid, and they crash their car, there will be no ICU bed for them.”

	Gibney said his best advice for Albertans is to stay home as much as possible, in an effort to ease the burden on already overworked healthcare staff.

       Pfizer Canada cites 'urgency' in plans to seek authorization for kids' COVID vaccine

	“How will it affect the kids in a longer time? As far as their health is concerned, as far as their growth is concerned,” wondered Monika Parmar, also the parent of a school-aged child.

	On Monday, Pfizer released preliminary information from a phase 2/3 trial of their COVID-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11. According to a company press release the trial involved “a two-dose regimen of 10 µg administered 21 days apart, a smaller dose than the 30 µg dose used for people 12 and older.”

	“As [trial participants] are getting down littler and littler, we’re seeing littler and littler doses but what they’re looking to see is to make sure it’s the same amount of antibodies regardless of the dose you got,“ said Kelly Grindrod, a member of the Region of Waterloo Vaccine Taskforce and a professor at the University of Waterloo’s School of Pharmacy. “That’s what these trials are actually looking at.”

	Summarizing the trial results, the Pfizer release stated, ""in participants 5 to 11 years of age, the vaccine was safe, well-tolerated and showed robust neutralizing antibody responses.""

	“They say that it’s safe which is great news,” Grindrod added. “This is actually very good news because it tells us that they're at the stage where we can start thinking about the approval of the vaccines for children but we know very little about what the data actually says so far.”

	South of the border, Pfizer is seeking authorization for the emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine in American children ages 5 to 11.

	Pfizer Canada told CTV News Kitchener they share an ""urgency"" to provide that data to Health Canada but were unable to provide a timeline of when they will formally submit it for approval.

	As for the logistics of how shots will get into arms, the rollout may be organized by each individual Health Unit.

	“We are working closely with local physicians to administer vaccines to this age group as soon as they’re approved for them,"" Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health said in a statement.

	WDG Public Health also stated the plan for this age group would likely see a combination of vaccinations done through appointments at mini-mass clinics, in doctor’s offices and in public health offices but reiterated the fact that plans are not yet concrete.

	Region of Waterloo Public Health said it is likely to continue the use of existing vaccine clinics but with a family twist. They are looking to make changes, taking lessons learned from clinic survey data.

	The health unit is also looking into the possibility of organizing after-school clinics.

	""Key partners, such as primary care and community pharmacies are collaborating with us on a variety of options up for consideration,"" said Sharon Ord, vaccine communications lead for Region of Waterloo Public Health.

	CTV News reached out to local school boards asking if they are working with health units to possibly administer shots but were directed back to public health officials.

	Ontario’s Ministry of Health said the province “continues to follow NACI’s guidelines that individuals who are born in 2009 or earlier are eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.”

	In a written statement, the Ministry added they are continuously monitoring evidence and are following the lead of Health Canada.

	“Working with our public health and health system partners we will be ready to administer doses to children aged five to 11 as soon as they are approved by Health Canada,"" the Ministry said.

	But when could a vaccine be approved?

	“It all depends what the data shows. They go over this data especially for kids extremely carefully,” Grindrod explained.

	There have been speculations the United States may begin vaccinating younger children by the end of October, but Grindrod hinted that timeline seems a little ambitious for Canadians given Pfizer hasn’t officially submitted its data for approval yet.

	“I think we have some confidence now it’s going to be likely before Christmas, likely before the new year. The question is when. Is it October? November? We don’t really know yet,” Grindrod said.

	Pfizer says trial results for children under the age of five may be available as soon as the end of the year.

	Five are the result of close contact with a positive case, three are community-acquired, two are travel-related, and one is outbreak-related. The remaining cases are under investigation.

	VACCINE CERTIFICATE TAKES EFFECT WEDNESDAY

	Over the past 18 months, businesses have had to pivot from lockdown measures to various safety protocols, and most recently, a new proof of vaccine policy requiring workers to turn away customers without evidence they are immunized against COVID-19.

	In an interview with CTV News last week, Ryan Mallough, director of provincial affairs for Ontario with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said that putting the onus on employees was a lot to ask.

	""Recovery is still very much in its infancy, and this is another burden both administrative and financial thrust upon small businesses.""

	Additionally, the question remains how will it be enforced?

	In a statement to CTV News, Barrie police said unless there is a public safety concern, criminal activity or legislative concerns, like trespassing, don't call them.

	Rather, the police service said to direct issues of compliance to the health unit.

	Meanwhile, the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit said education is key when the province's vaccine certificate comes into effect.

	A spokesperson for the health unit said it would be taking a ""graduated approach with emphasis on education"" to deal with compliance issues once specific indoor settings are required to have proof of vaccination to allow patrons to enter.

	Starting Wednesday, residents will have to show proof of being fully vaccinated for at least 14 days, or a medical exemption, along with a piece of ID to access a long list of non-essential businesses, including gyms, movie theatres and restaurants.

	Ontario's health minister said she doesn't expect major pushback from unvaccinated residents.

	Individuals caught not complying with the vaccine policy could face fines starting at $750. The fines for businesses start at $1,000.

PPC gains in rural Sask. add competition for Tories,"Sept. 22, 2021 4:45 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	Despite not winning a seat federally, the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) saw vote increases in rural Saskatchewan on election night.

	With some poll results still trickling in, the PPC has already vastly surpassed its 2019 vote totals in several Saskatchewan ridings. The new-for-2021 Maverick Party – born from the WEXIT movement – also siphoned some votes.

	In Saskatchewan rural ridings, PPC vote percentages at-least tripled across the board from 2019.

       'People aren't scared of COVID here': Few masks in sight at PPC headquarters on election night in SaskatoonMaxime Bernier says he will stay on as PPC leader, despite loss in Quebec ridingFederal election results for SaskatchewanBlue wave soaks Sask. in second consecutive federal election 

	University of Regina political scientist Jim Farney said PPC leader Maxime Bernier appeared to target Saskatchewan to increase the party's support among voters who want a right-wing political alternative.

	“Since Harper’s loss in 2015 – and you see it provincially, too, with the Buffalo Party – there’s an element of ‘the system needs to radically change, none of the options on the table are doing it for us.’ So that’s a big part of the story,” Farney said, in an interview with CTV Morning Live Regina.

	Joseph Angolano, vice president of Canadian polling firm Mainstreet Research, said the increase in PPC ballots is due to “protest votes” — traditional conservative voters switching their vote because they are upset with the current party platform.

	“[The PPC] did take second [and] it did take third in quite a few seats in southern Saskatchewan,” said Angolano. “I don’t know if that’s going to continue if we’re going to be having another election in 18 months or not, we don’t know, but it’ll be interesting to see what will happen

	Some of the most significant PPC gains were seen in Yorkton—Melville and Souris—Moose Mountain.

	RESULTS MAP: Track every result in our interactive map 

	In 2019, the PPC received 941 votes, or 2.4 per cent of the vote in Yorkton—Melville, giving them a last place finish in the riding. Not even two years later, that number has more than tripled to 3,150 votes, or 9.5 per cent, resulting in third place for candidate Braden Robertson.

	Cathay Wagantall, the newly re-elected Conservative Member of Parliament for the staunchly blue riding, said it was the right-wing competition that created the main challenges for her campaign in 2021.

	“We did have the Mavericks and the PPC running in this riding as well, so it gave people other options. Obviously more so on the right than we’ve faced in the past, it’s usually been more of a challenge from the left,” Wagantall said, after the announcement of her projected victory on Monday night.

	As of Tuesday morning, PPC candidate Diane Neufeld had 3,436 votes, or 9.2 per cent of the vote, claiming second place in Souris—Moose Mountain.

	Further north in Battlefords-Lloydminster, the PPC also saw smaller gains, likely due to a surge in support for the Maverick Party.

	With just one poll left to report, Ken Rutherford from the Maverick Party sat in third place with 2,113 votes, or 7.1 per cent of the vote, with Terry Sieben of the PPC close behind with 1,798 votes, or six per cent.

	Both parties fell behind the second place NDP, but received more votes than the Liberal and Green parties in that riding.

	The Maverick’s mission statement on their website said the party’s goal is “to achieve greater fairness and self-determination for western Canadians” through either constitutional change or the creation of an independent nation.

	Speaking in Saskatoon on election night, Bernier told PPC supporters he wants to end the “COVID hysteria.” Despite growth in the popular vote, the party did not win a single seat in the House of Commons.

	""This is not just a political party. It is a movement. It is an ideological revolution,"" Bernier said.

	""Unfortunately, we won't be able to carry on this fight in Parliament, but we will continue this battle to unite Canadians under the freedom umbrella.”

	Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said the improvement for the PPC in Saskatchewan and across the country could have been harnessed by the spread of misinformation throughout the pandemic and divisions within Canada.

	“It think it speaks to some of the divisions that were highlighted throughout this campaign,” Moe said during a Tuesday morning press conference. “Some of the divisions that we are seeing in the broader society across Canada and across Saskatchewan, and some of those divisions are coming through with some embracing some of the misinformation that is available out on social media and on the internet.”

	He added that he feels Maxime Bernier and the party attempted to “prolong the pandemic” by embracing anti-vaccine sentiments.

	Despite the boost, Farney is unsure whether the PPC will have staying power to hold onto their share of votes outside of the pandemic.

	“The question is, when we do get through COVID-19, does that alienation stay as strong as it seems to be right now,” Farney said.

	In total in 2019, the PPC received 1.8 per cent of the vote in Saskatchewan. Although results have not been finalized, the party will likely come out of 2021 with a much larger share.

On Monday alone, SOS said COVID-19 cases were reported at 12 different schools in Alberta, two schools moved to online learning and two reported outbreaks.   “The lack of reporting requirements, and contact tracing by AHS (Alberta Health Services) is definitely feeding into the anxiety of parents,” said Moussa. “Because there's so much unknown information, and  you're reliant on this volunteered information instead of required information and required isolation.”  On Friday, the Calgary Board of Education penned a letter to the UCP government over its concerns with COVID-19 in schools.   ""We are frustrated by the lack of coherent provincial guidance being provided to our families and students,"" the CBE said.   ""Families have received mixed messages about the real and substantial risk that COVID-19 presents to our communities, and school jurisdictions are left to fill the public health gap left by the government.""   Meanwhile, Calgary Catholic School District said Monday it recognizes the ""ongoing challenges of creating and safe learning environments in our schools during the fourth wave of COVID-19.""  ""Our board is currently in the process of communicating their concerns to the provincial government.""  SPIKE WAS AVOIDABLE: EXPERT  Infectious disease specialist Craig Jenne said the current spike of COVID-19 in school age children was avoidable.  “If we look back to last year, when we started school, we were able to get through most of September and October without substantial outbreaks,"" said Jenne. “We were just a little more careful. We had more universal masking. We had contact tracing, but perhaps critically, we had fewer viral cases in the community.”  University of Calgary's Craig Jenne infectious disease expert said the low vaccine rate among 20 to 29-year-olds could be a concern when school goes back to class in the fall  Jenne stressed the case jump in school aged children is not only coming from the return to school, but from increased community transmission as well.  He anticipates that as the emergency measures instituted last week start to mitigate community spread, cases among Alberta children will decline as well.  “The thing we should again, keep in mind is, it's going to take a week to two weeks to start seeing those cases (decline). We have brought in measures, the big question is, will it be enough? Will that flatten the curve? Or will it slow the curve? But we should be able to see an impact of these measures in the coming weeks on kids.”  At this time, Albertans under the age of 12 aren't eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, but that could soon change.  On Monday, Pfizer said its vaccine is proving effective in kids under 12, and it will be seeking authorization for the age group soon.  - With files from Sarah Reid

     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	When on-campus classes resumed Monday, it was with new requirements from some post-secondary institutions.

	The city's major post-secondary schools – which cancelled on-campus learning for two days to figure out how to apply Alberta's Restrictions Exemption Program – have released their plans for the remainder of the semester.

	When the Restrictions Exemption Program took effect Monday, it also took effect on the MacEwan University and University of Alberta campuses.

	Both institutions told students on Friday they would be participating in the Restrictions Exemption Program immediately.

	At the University of Alberta, as per the provincial Restrictions Exemption Program, unvaccinated staff and students were required to submit a negative COVID-19 test every 72 hours. As well, Monday was the deadline for students to have received their first dose of vaccine in time to comply with the school's vaccine mandate, which starts Nov. 1.

	Rapid testing will only be provided by the U of A after Oct. 29 to those who have been approved for a vaccine exemption.

	MacEwan University also immediately began participating in the Restrictions Exemption Program on Monday, requiring students to have at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine or a negative COVID-19 test. Vaccinated students were able to register their vaccine status through the school's app and portal, while negative COVID-19 tests couldn't be older than 72 hours.

	The school previously announced it would implement a vaccine mandate for the winter 2022 term, which would require all staff and students to be fully vaccinated to be on campus. At that point, negative tests will no longer be accepted for access. MacEwan has promised to waive tuition for five fully vaccinated students for the year's fall and winter terms. Administration said at the end of August 95 per cent of faculty and 86 per cent of students who participated in a voluntary survey had been fully immunized.

	NAIT, CONCORDIA TO OPT IN BY OCT.

	Alberta's Restrictions Exemption Program will take effect at Concordia University on Oct. 4 and at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology on Oct. 8.

	Starting Oct. 4, Concordia students and staff will need to be able to prove they have one dose of vaccine or a negative COVID-19 test, and two doses by Oct. 25. Those without two doses or an accepted exemption to the vaccine will not be allowed on campus after Oct. 25.

	Concordia's classes will continue to be held online until Oct. 4.

	NAIT students who wish to continue learning on campus will need to get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 24 in order to comply with the Restrictions Exemption Program when it takes effect there on Oct. 8. As per the school's own vaccine mandate, students will need to be able to prove full immunization on Oct. 25, and as of Nov. 8, rapid tests won't be accepted as an alternative.

	Both NAIT and Concordia have extended withdrawal deadlines to Sept. 24 and 21, respectively, for students who do not want to meet the schools' vaccine requirements.

	The decision comes after the province announced 199 new cases over the weekend. 63 cases on Saturday, a record high of 75 new cases on Sunday, and 61 on Monday. The total number of active cases across the province is 484.

	""This is the most we have recorded since the pandemic began 18 months ago,"" said Russell.

	Twenty-three people are now in hospital with the virus, with 14 in an intensive-care unit. Provincial Green Party leader David Coon says he believes some of the continued cases may have been avoided had the province re-implemented the mandate sooner.

	""It should have been done earlier, no question about it, but I'm glad that the government is bringing in masks in indoor public spaces again,"" Coon told CTV News from his constituency office via Zoom.

	Despite the return of the mask mandate, New Brunswick is still in the green phase, though Higgs says that could also change in the coming days.

	""We're anxious to work through the numbers and decide what next steps are required, but that could include any of the restrictions that we had in the past as we might move back there to ensure that we get under control.""

	When asked if he regretted the province's original decision to lift the state of emergency, and subsequently all restrictions, on July 30, Higgs said he stands by the decision.

	""I'd certainly do the same thing again. I think a lot of people benefited from the summer, period,"" said Higgs.

	David Coon, who has been vocal about disagreeing with the Premier's COVID-19 recovery plan, says vaccination numbers over the summer didn't add up to what was necessary for a safe reopening.

	""It was very clear that the rate of vaccinations had already slowed down before that decision had been made. You could see it was not occurring at the rate that was needed.""

	Higgs says the province has seen a spike in vaccination bookings since last week.

	""Between last Wednesday when we announced our new measures, and today at 11 am, more than 6,600 people have booked an appointment for their first or second dose of COVID-19 vaccine,"" said Higgs.

	As of Monday, the province is reporting 77.8 per cent of eligible New Brunswickers are fully vaccinated, and 86.5 per cent have received their first dose.

	According to Public Health, 152 of the 199 new cases, or 76 per cent are not fully vaccinated.

	“We are now seeing infections among fully vaccinated New Brunswickers. We were aware that we could have breakthrough cases in the population, but certainly the affect on our health care system is much, much lower in those who are fully vaccinated,” said Dr. Russell during Monday’s news update.

	MANDATORY MASKS IN EFFECT TUESDAY

	As of 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, masks will be mandatory in all indoor public spaces, including:

	
		public spaces where the public and employees interact, such as retail businesses, malls, service centres, places of worship, and restaurants and bars except while eating;
	
		organized indoor gatherings in public spaces, such as weddings and funerals;
	
		common areas like lobbies, elevators and hallways, and public shared spaces including those in private sector and government workspaces; and
	
		public transportation.


	Previously existing mask policies continue to apply in public schools and early childhood learning facilities.

	The province announced last week that also effective Tuesday at 11:59 p.m., people will be required to show proof of vaccination when accessing certain events, services and businesses, and anyone entering New Brunswick must preregister their travel.

	“The past few weeks have been difficult for all New Brunswickers as we have seen our case numbers and hospitalizations rise quickly,” said N.B. Premier Blaine Higgs during Monday’s news update. ""The return of these health and safety measures may feel like we are taking a step backwards, but we must look at our current situation and consider what will happen if we do nothing.""

	Since the pandemic began, 1,899 people in B.C. have died of COVID-19, including 58 people in the Island Health region.

	There are currently 27 people in hospital with COVID-19 on Vancouver Island, with 16 patients in critical care.

	There are 21 active outbreaks at B.C. health-care facilities, including one on Vancouver Island.

	On Sunday, Island Health declared a COVID-19 outbreak at a Victoria care home. Two cases of the coronavirus have been detected at the Victoria Chinatown Care Centre.

	All 31 residents of the home are now being tested for COVID-19, as are staff members, the health authority said.

	The last health-care outbreak on the island was at Sunset Lodge long-term care home in Victoria. It ended on Friday, after infecting 21 residents and 15 staff members, killing six residents.

	Approximately 86.8 per cent of eligible British Columbians have now received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 79.4 per cent have received two doses.

	The province has administered 7,711,306 doses of COVID-19 vaccine since it began its immunizing campaign in December.

	Rika Johnson is the mother of two adolescent boys that she will have to raise without their father, after her husband lost a months-long battle with COVID-19.

	“It was quite sudden because he was doing well, he got transferred out of the ICU after being in there for 3 months,” Johnson said about her husband Jeremy.

	The entire family tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-April, and within a few days Jeremy’s cough and chest pain were so severe that he wound up in Burnaby General Hospital. He was later transferred to Royal Columbian, where he died in August.

	“I think that we’re very fortunate that we all got to say our goodbyes,” said Johnson. “Because through this whole pandemic there’s been families that didn’t get that chance.”

	At the time the family got sick, none of them were eligible for a dose of the vaccine, but Johnson said Jeremy was eager to get it – acknowledging that she was somewhat hesitant at first.

	“Just because of my body and reaction. Not because I’m anti-vax,” she said. “I’m 100 per cent for vaccinations, but I just wanted to make sure that I had the time to be able to heal from getting the vaccine if I had a reaction.”

	After watching her husband’s long, painful battle with the virus, she is now encouraging everyone to get their shots.

	“You don’t know how COVID is going to affect you if you get it,” she said. “If there’s some way you can protect yourself, then you should do it.”

	On Saturday, a few thousand people opposed to the vaccines and B.C.’s proof-of-vaccination requirements rallied at the Vancouver Art Gallery for a protest before marching through downtown streets.

	The gathering happened just blocks from St. Paul’s Hospital, where emergency room physician Dr. Jeff Yoo says almost all of the people currently being treated for COVID-19 have not been vaccinated.

	“Now in this fourth wave, we are really seeing younger patients who were previously healthy, who are getting critically ill and require(ing) intubation,” he said.

	Stats from the province back up his anecdotal observations.

	In a tweet Friday, Health Minister Adrian Dix shared the number of people in intensive care with COVID-19 by vaccination status.

	

	

	Of the 136 patients, eight were partially vaccinated, seven fully vaccinated, and 121 unvaccinated.

	The difference becomes even more stark when accounting for the fact nearly 88 percent of British Columbians have had at least one dose of a vaccine.

	“This is really a self-inflicted injury from society. We don’t need to be struggling through this fourth wave, you know?,” said Dr. Yoo. “A lot of these young, healthy patients could have prevented getting ill if they had just gotten vaccinated.”

	As she prepares for her late husband’s celebration of life, Johnson is taking this opportunity to reach out to others who may be uncertain about getting the shot in the hopes that her story will convince them to do it.

	""You don't want to leave your family members without their loved ones, or children without their fathers, or children without their mothers,” she said, her voice trailing off as she was overcome with emotion.

	Saturday’s Edmonton Elks game is the city’s first major event offering rapid COVID-19 testing at the door.

	The team previously announced that starting in October fans would have to provide proof of double vaccination or a negative test result.

    Advertisement
    
	Those plans changed once the province’s restrictions exemption program was announced Wednesday evening. To be in line with the program, the Elks are asking everyone 12 years of age or older for proof of one dose of COVID-19 vaccine or a negative test result from within 48 hours of kickoff.

	Tests are offered outside Commonwealth Stadium for $50.

	“This is an opportunity for everyone to attend the game in a safe environment,” said Chris Presson, Elks CEO and president.

	“People understand where we are as a country, as a province, and as a city,” Presson added. “Any time you open the paper and see 2,000 new cases is cause for concern. We want a safe environment and (Commonwealth Stadium) is a part of that.”

	Individual tests take around five to six minutes for results. Many fans who came out early Saturday to receive theirs say the short wait and $50 price tag will be well worth it come game time.

	“It’s a small price to pay to do the right thing and keep people safe,” one fan said.

	“I don’t find it to be a problem,” another fan said. “I’ve seen people at my work pay $140 for the test, so I don’t have a problem with it.”

	Presson said the testing site saw busy periods throughout Saturday afternoon.

	No decision has been made on whether to continue the onsite rapid testing throughout the season. The Elks say that will depend on demand.

	E-Comm, which handles the vast majority of 911 calls in B.C., said most of the vaccine-card-related calls it's received have been from businesses looking to report people who were unwilling to provide their cards.

	""Unless there is an immediate risk to public safety, such as someone causing a disturbance or acting aggressively, non-compliance related to immunization records should not be reported on emergency lines.""

	The dispatcher said it expected to see an increase in calls about vaccine card non-compliance over the weekend, when restaurants and bars are typically busier.

	Since Sept. 13, B.C. residents have been required to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 in order to patronize certain non-essential businesses and events. 

	Until Sept. 27, the paper immunization record provided at a B.C. vaccination clinic is acceptable, but after that date, residents will have to show their unique vaccine QR code, along with a piece of photo ID.

	For now, proof of a first dose of vaccine is sufficient to gain entry into the designated areas. By Oct. 24, proof of full vaccination will be required.

	Protests have been held across the province since the vaccine card system was announced, and thousands gathered at the Vancouver Art Gallery on Saturday for the latest round of demonstrations.

	As of Friday, 86.5 per cent of eligible B.C. residents age 12 or older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 78.9 per cent had received both doses.

	The province has changed course on how its proof of vaccination push will impact retailers.

	The Restrictions Exemption Program (REP) is set to take hold Monday, and was originally slated to include retail businesses.

	But Saturday evening, the province changed the REP's fine print.

	A government representative tells CTV News retailers will no longer be able to participate in the program.

	That means capacity will be capped at one third of fire code occupancy and customers will only be allowed to shop with members of their own household or two close contacts if they live alone.

	As of Saturday, the change only applied to retailers. Restaurants, bars, theatres and fitness centres can all still participate in the REP to nix restrictions placed on their businesses.

	Madame Premier in Inglewood was preparing to enter the program on Saturday morning.

	When told of the news later in the day, owner Sarah Elder-Chamanara told CTV News she still plans to ask for proof of vaccination for those entering her store.

	It's a route all retailers can still take, but the onus is now on the private business to implement any immunization-related change.

	Elder-Chamanara says she believes the original rule already had its flaws for Alberta's small businesses.

	""I don't have a staff I can depend on and I don't have the ability to rely on someone at the door like a restaurant, so I think it'll actually be more challenging for businesses like mine,"" she said. ""I just want to remain optimistic that people are going to be kind and empathetic.""

	The province is still finalizing certain details of the plan. A representative promised additional details prior to Monday.

	""We know it straddles a number of communities that are hotspot when it comes to vaccine hesitancy, and some of the rates of vaccination are the lowest not only in the province but the country,"" said Saunders.

	Incumbent Conservative Ted Falk was first elected in 2013 and has won every election since by a fairly wide margin.

	Recently, however, Falk had to walk back some claims he made on the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine.

	His campaign did not respond to CTV News.

	Falk's position is something Liberal candidate Trevor Kirczenow is looking to capitalize on.

	""It's very frustrating, his position on vaccines,"" said Kirczenow, ""His position on vaccination has been unclear. He won't say if he's been vaccinated.""

	Kirczenow lives on a farm near Dugald and previously ran in 2019. He said this time around, he's talked to a lot of people who aren't sure who they're voting for.

	""I think a lot of voters are looking for clarity,"" he said. “I've met a lot of undecided voters.”

	This election also has another difference -- the People's Party of Canada.

	PPC candidate Nöel Gautron has lived in the area his entire life and, according to his bio, is against vaccine passports.

	He's a candidate that Saunders believes could steal some Conservative voters.

	""And we know that the PPC has been making some inroads into Conservative territory, particularly in a place with vaccine hesitancy. So that candidate has been picking up some steam,"" noted Saunders.

	Also on the Provencher ballot are the NDP Party's Serina Pottinger, the Green Party's Janine Gibson and independent Rick Loewen.

	As candidates make a push to swing undecided voters, they'll have to wait until election day on September 20 to see the fruits of their labour.

	A recent outbreak at the Harvest House has shown just how quickly the virus can spread among those who don’t have a place to call home.

	In an effort to help prevent further spread, they had a pop-up vaccine clinic on site Friday to help make vaccinations more accessible for people, as rates have been low at the facility.

	""The experience has been both awful and amazing. I’ve met people that would really surprise you when you’re down and out,"" says Cormier.

       What will the upcoming flu season in Canada look like?Moderna developing single-dose COVID-19, flu combo vaccineCost of COVID-19 hospital stays far exceeds other illnesses: study

	That's despite provincial data showing zero lab-confirmed cases of influenza across all five health zones between Sept. 27, 2020 and April 3, 2021.

	The previous season saw 8,470 lab-confirmed cases of influenza, 1,605 hospitalizations, 161 ICU admissions and 41 deaths.

	Earlier this year, experts said it was likely that the measures used to prevent COVID-19 infection – physical distancing, proper hand hygiene and other protocol – were effective against influenza too.

	Even with that in mind, AHS maintains it is still very important for Albertans to acquire their seasonal flu shot.

	""The influenza vaccine is the best way to lower your risk of getting influenza and having health problems related to influenza,"" the agency writes on its website. ""It can also help stop you from spreading it to others.""

	'CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN'

	Pharmacists in Calgary, like Brian Jones who works for Shoppers Drug Mart, says he hopes that people will do the right thing and get their seasonal flu vaccine.

	""You could argue we are in a different restrictive atmosphere this year than we were last year,"" he said during an interview with CTV News. ""We were much more restricted last year with what we could and couldn't do.""

	Now that people are out and about, attending events and meeting with friends, Jones says the risk for spreading influenza and COVID-19 is much higher. When that happens, it could put more pressure on the health care system.

	""My worry is that people do end up in ICU, people do end up in hospital with flu – we can't afford to have that happen. Not only for our health care system, but for ourselves. If there's no room in the ICU now, how is there going be more room if we start getting flu?""

	Jones believes the health care system won't be able to handle a tough influenza season at the same time that it's fighting COVID-19's fourth wave.

	""I can't imagine getting both viruses at the same time or in close proximity to each other. It's hard to say because of the zero cases last year, but people may not feel that urgency, but there will always be that cohort of people who get the flu shots every year.""

	He thinks it is also unlikely that the government will need to introduce measures and incentives to encourage Albertans to roll up their sleeves once more.

	""Who knows how people are feeling? I think the people who have gotten the (COVID-19) vaccine up until the last few weeks have gotten it for the right reason. There hasn't been the $100 on the table, there hasn't been (the idea of) you can't go anywhere without the vaccine.""

	""I'm hoping that those people that will still get the flu shot will continue the momentum of vaccination and try to get to the end of these restrictions. It's not about COVID-19 per se; it's about the burden to the health care system.""

	Last flu season, there were approximately 1.6 million doses of vaccine administered to Albertans.

	CTV News has reached out to AHS and Alberta Health about the plan for distributing influenza vaccines.

	HEALTHY AND SAFE SCHOOLS GUIDELINES UPDATED

	""Since the beginning of this school year, 20 schools across health zones 1, 3, 4 and 5 have been affected by about 80 confirmed cases of COVID-19,"" public health said in a news release. ""By comparison, the 2020-21 school year had about 100 cases across 50 schools, in every health zone.""

	Because of the increased rate of infection this year, the New Brunswick is updating its Healthy and Safe Schools guidelines to better protect students in kindergarten to Grade 12.

	On Monday, the following measures will come into effect:

	
		Using classroom groupings (or bubbles) to the greatest extent possible. Class sizes will not be changed.
	
		Only classroom bubble-friendly field trips will be permitted for students in kindergarten to Grade 8.
	
		Schools will look for ways to encourage greater physical distancing between groupings, such as adjusting lunch or recess schedules.
	
		Physical education classes will be taught outdoors, weather permitting. If taught indoors, students and staff must wear masks.
	
		Assemblies will no longer be permitted.


	The province also says that effective Wednesday, all students who are eligible to be vaccinated (those born in 2009 and earlier who do not have a medical exemption) must be vaccinated to be eligible to participate in indoor or outdoor extracurricular and intramural activities.

	""To reduce the risk of transmission on buses, and allow for greater physical distancing, families are asked to drive their children to school if they are able,"" public health said in a news release. ""Community use of schools remains restricted to youth activities. Students 12 and over must be vaccinated or have a medical exemption to participate.""

	The province says it will review these guidelines in the next few weeks.

	""The growing number of cases of COVID-19 in communities is having a significant impact on public school operations,"" said Education and Early Childhood Development Minister Dominic Cardy. ""We have a duty to protect our students, especially those under 12 who are not yet eligible to receive protection through COVID-19 vaccines.""

	Cardy said the province can only do so much, and called on parents to do their part.

	""We will need the help of families, communities and businesses to help protect our school communities,"" he said.

	INCREASE IN VACCINATION APPOINTMENTS

	New Brunswick Public Health said Friday there has been an increase in vaccination appointment bookings at pharmacies and regional health authority clinics across the province.

	""Demand for vaccinations has picked up over the last few days and I am greatly encouraged by this,"" said Russell. ""(Thursday), we scheduled 1,929 vaccination appointments at regional health authority clinics, in addition to 1,700 bookings the day before. Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, the recent average was 600 bookings per day. We are also seeing a major uptick at pharmacies and walk-in clinics. On Thursday, 600 additional vaccines had to be delivered to a clinic in the Moncton area.""

	New Brunswick announced Wednesday that effective Tuesday, Sept. 21, at 11:59 p.m., people will be required to show proof of full vaccination when accessing certain events, services and businesses.

	Information on the updated regulations is available online.

	Public Health reported Friday that 77.5 per cent of eligible New Brunswickers are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and 86.1 per cent have received their first dose of a vaccine.

	New Brunswickers can go to a walk-in clinic or book an appointment through a participating pharmacy or at a Vitalité or Horizon health network clinic.

	""All eligible New Brunswickers can book their second-dose appointments for a date that is at least 28 days after their first dose,"" public health said in a news release. ""Those attending a vaccination clinic are asked to bring their Medicare card, a signed consent form and, for those receiving their second dose, a copy of the record of immunization provided after receiving their first dose.""

	There is a list of upcoming mobile and walk-in clinics available online.

	CONFIRMED CASES IN SCHOOLS

	Public health said Friday that positive cases have been confirmed in schools in zones 1 (Moncton region), 3 (Fredericton region) and 5 (Campbellton region).

	""The respective school communities have been notified,"" public health said in a news release. ""If you or a family member have been in close contact with a case, you will be notified by Public Health for contact tracing. This notification may be communicated by the school. If you do not hear directly from Public Health, you have not been identified as a close contact.""

	According to New Brunswick’s Healthy and Safe Schools guidelines, schools with cases will close or move to online learning for at least one calendar day to support contact tracing, risk assessments and operational responses.

	Here's a breakdown of the cases at schools:

	
		Zone 1 (Moncton region) – A new case of COVID-19 was confirmed at West Riverview Elementary School.
	
		Zone 3 (Fredericton region) – New cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed at Andover Elementary School, Perth-Andover Middle School, and Southern Victoria High School, all located in Perth-Andover.
	
		Zone 5 (Campbellton region) – A new case of COVID-19 was confirmed at Sugarloaf Senior High School in Campbellton.


	POTENTIAL PUBLIC EXPOSURES

	Anyone with symptoms of the virus, as well as anyone who has been at the site of a possible public exposure, is urged to request a test online or call Tele-Care 811 to get an appointment.

"Sask. has 'highest burden' of COVID-19 in Canada, health authority says","Sept. 18, 2021 3:02 a.m. CST","
     
     Saskatoon - 
     
    
	According to data presented during a physicians' town hall, Saskatchewan has the ""highest burden"" of COVID-19 in Canada.

	Thursday evening's virtual Saskatchewan Health Authority town hall event came just hours after Premier Scott Moe announced a series of new measures to help control the spread of COVID-19.

    Advertisement
    
	During the event, Medical Health Officer Dr. Johnmark Opondo said Saskatchewan has the highest new daily COVID-19 hospitalization rate in Canada — with Alberta in a close second.

	""Sadly to report in the last 14 days … the death rates in Saskatchewan are the second-highest of all the provinces,"" Opondo said.

	Opondo said the province saw its highest test-positivity rate late last week, 11.8 per cent, surpassing the previous record of 8.2 per cent set during the third wave.

	The current fourth wave of COVID-19 will probably be ""the largest COVID-19 experience"" the province has seen so far, Opondo said.

	Because the Delta variant is ""so transmissible, a vaccination rate of 85 per cent among eligible people over the age of 12 is needed to reach herd immunity, according to Opondo.

	""Vaccines alone may not get us where we want to go,"" Opondo said.

	""We need to continue to promote reducing indoor density, maintaining physical distancing, limiting non-essential gatherings and non-essential visits outside the house.""

	Opondo called the introduction of a masking measure an ""important step.""

	""We are going to continue to encourage people to work from home and we do want to see further policies, some of which were discussed today, which would introduce things like vaccine passports (and) mandatory vaccines for certain worker categories.""

	Opondo said the policies have been shown to ""accelerate"" COVID-19 vaccination in other jurisdictions.

	If Saskatchewan does not cut transmission and increase vaccine uptake, Opondo said hospital capacity will exceed previous highs reached during the third wave of COVID-19 that battered the province in the spring.

	The region has now confirmed 19,367 COVID-19 cases, including 18,867 resolved infections and 202 active cases.

	Since Tuesday, health partners in the region processed another 3,826 COVID-19 tests, bringing the total number of tests completed to 582,904.

	As of Friday, Waterloo Region's rolling seven-day positivity rate sits at 2.7 per cent. The current reproductive rate of the virus is 1.0.

	Regional officials said the area's case rate is approximately 30 cases per 100,000 per week.

	“Local trends have remained fairly stable but we are seeing a slowly increasing trend over time in our daily case rates, especially among those who have not been vaccinated,"" Dr. Wang said.

	HOSPITALIZATIONS DIP, OUTBREAK CRITERIA CHANGES

	Hospitalizations decreased from eight to six in Friday's update, with intensive care admissions dropping by one, down to five.

	There are currently five active COVID-19 outbreaks across Waterloo Region.

	At Friday's briefing, the health unit announced it is implementing new criteria to disclose COVID-19 outbreaks at a workplace, facility or event.

	The disclosure criteria for workplace, facility and event outbreaks will be lowered to five or more cases in a setting of 10 or more people and there are no significant privacy concerns.

	An outbreak will still be declared at two cases with an epi-link, but will only be listed by the category type. The setting can be named when the outbreak reaches five cases and is in a setting with more than 10 people, provided there are no privacy or safety concerns with sharing the name.



	The health unit plans to provide weekly updates on the number of resolved cases for outbreaks of 25 cases or more.

	“We expect that outbreaks will continue to occur but the size and scope of the outbreaks should be better controlled due to ample availability of vaccine, the ability for workplaces to enact vaccination policies, strong infection prevention and control requirements for workplaces,” Dr. Wang said.

	The region's disclosure policy will remain unchanged for outbreaks at long-term care facilities, retirement homes, schools and childcare facilities.

	MORE VARIANT OF CONCERN CASES REPORTED

	Thirty more infections were confirmed as variant of concern cases on Friday, bumping the cumulative total up to 6,125.

	The region's variant breakdown is as follows:

	
		3,128 are the Alpha variant, first identified in the United Kingdom and originally known as B.1.1.7
	
		21 are the Beta variant, originally detected in South Africa and previously referred to as B.1.315
	
		98 are the Gamma variant, initially discovered in Brazil and labelled as P.1
	
		2,616 are the Delta variant, first found in India and previously called B.1.617
	
		262 cases have had a mutation detected, but have not yet had a variant strain confirmed


	""Vaccines are changing the pandemic, but the severity of the Delta variant can not be underestimated,"" Dr. Wang said. ""Public health measures are still very important.""

	VACCINATION UPDATE

	Health partners across Waterloo Region have now administered 844,214 COVID-19 vaccine doses, with 1,056 jabs put into arms on Thursday.

	More than 81.5 per cent of the region's eligible population is fully vaccinated and 87.75 per cent have received at least one dose.

	Among Waterloo Region's entire population, 70.25 per cent are fully vaccinated and 75.56 per cent have received at least one dose.

	“The fourth wave has begun in Ontario and we are seeing that the risk for infection and serious outcomes is far greater for those who are not yet fully vaccinated,"" Dr. Wang said. ""The vaccine is the best measure to reduce your risk of severe outcomes but we all must continue to practice public health precautions to reduce the spread.""

	Ontario's vaccination certification program begins on Wednesday. Individuals will be required to show proof of full immunization to access certain non-essential businesses, such as restaurants, gyms and movie theatres.

	""If we don’t put this in place and we don’t use it, we will be in general lockdown,"" Ian McLean, chief executive of the Greater Kitchener Waterloo Chamber of Conference, said at Friday's COVID-19 briefing.

	PROVINCE-WIDE SNAPSHOT

	Province-wide, 795 new COVID-19 cases were reported by health officials on Friday.

	Of the new infections, 582 cases involved people who are either unvaccinated, partially vaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown. The remaining 213 infections involved people who are fully vaccinated.

	Ontario has now confirmed 578,048 COVID-19 cases and 9,637 deaths since the pandemic began.

	Of the new cases, 10 residents became infected after close contact with a positive case, four are community-acquired, one is related to an outbreak, and the remaining are under investigation.

	Twenty-two unvaccinated residents tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours, two partially vaccinated and one fully.

	The positivity rates in Simcoe County and Muskoka are at par at 2.0 per cent, sliding just below the province at 2.4 per cent.

	VACCINE LATEST

	Currently, 74 per cent of Simcoe Muskoka residents have had at least one dose of the vaccine, but a critical care doctor with Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre (RVH) says that's not enough.

	Dr. Chris Martin says if vaccination rates don't increase, hospitals and staff will be overwhelmed, like in the third wave when the province paused non-emergent surgeries to deal with the situation.

	Martin says he's hopeful the province's new program, which requires residents to show proof of vaccination to access certain indoor facilities, will be the push people need to roll up their sleeves.

	The critical care doctor says they are treating more people in their 20's than in previous waves, more severe cases and most are unvaccinated.

	""By the time they reach the ICU, they know they should have gotten their shot,"" he adds.

	Martin says people don't see the pain of COVID-19 patients and their families; adding those realities could change minds about vaccinations.

	""They can't come in the room and talk to these patients, and they can't see the fear in their eyes and the family members who are crying, and that's the stuff I think that changes people's minds, and we just can't show that.""

	The three women were arrested on charges of misdemeanour assault and criminal mischief. They were given desk appearance tickets and ordered to appear in court Oct. 5.

	New York City's rule requiring proof of vaccination for indoor restaurant dining, gyms and entertainment venues has been in effect since Aug. 17 but is only being enforced as of this week.

	It is unclear how strictly the requirement that restaurants check vaccination status is being enforced. A request for information about the number of citations that have been issued was sent to the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio.

	Carmine's, which has two locations in New York City as well as outposts in spots including Las Vegas, is known for large servings of pasta and other Italian dishes.

	""We follow the laws,"" Banks said at a news conference outside the restaurant. ""I respect the vaccine mandate. We have an option, if you're not vaccinated, sit outside.""

	He said the Thursday's altercation started with a verbal dispute and escalated quickly.

North Bay’s Jewish community disappointed by PPC candidate’s tweet comparing vaccine rules to Holocaust,"Sept. 17, 2021 4:31 a.m. CST","

	Members of North Bay's Jewish community are disappointed in People’s Party of Canada candidate Greg Galante, who compared COVID-19 measures to the Holocaust.

	Galante tweeted that there are parallels between current public health guidelines and the events leading up to the Holocaust.

    Advertisement
    
	“There’s fair points to debate when it comes to COVID response,” said Larry Fuld, treasurer of Sons of Jacob Synagogue. “But, I don’t think anything that’s been said or done which comes close to comparing it to what happened in Nazi Germany.”

	Before the Nazis sent the Jews to the concentration camps, Adolf Hitler’s government began isolating them from society. This included the boycott of Jewish-owned businesses, Jews were forced to identify themselves with the Star of David and they were separated into ghettos.

	Half of Fuld’s father’s family perished in concentration camps, while other family members were able to flee Nazi Germany in 1941.

	“I can assure you that that they weren’t fleeing the public health policy of the time,” said Fuld. “That wasn’t the issue.”

	Galante was responding to a tweet posted by Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson where he called out those who are comparing masks and vaccine mandates to the Holocaust.

	“How did the Holocaust start?"" Galante tweeted back. ""Oh that’s right with a systemic and programmed stigmatization of a certain segment of society. They were demonized, labeled, targeted and then ultimately rounded up.”

	CTV News offered Galante a chance to clarify his stance. He initially agreed to an interview, but then cancelled.

	Fuld said the comparison has no merit.

	“It’s disappointing to see a candidate for political office make what I consider an absurd statement,” he said.

	Dr. Jim Chirico, North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit medical officer of health, also condemned the tweet during a Thursday morning media conference.

	“People recognize a statement like that for what it is: absurd,” Chirico said.

	Wednesday marked the start of Yom Kippur. It is the holiest time of the year in Judaism. Fuld said the comment made by Galante disrespects everyone who suffered through the Nazi reign of terror.

	“It’s not appropriate on any day, the comment,” he said. “It’s an affront to all of those poor souls who were tortured and murdered in those camps.”

	Fuld said he hopes Galante will reflect on his tweet and do research on the horrors of the Holocaust.

	Nurse Shelly McHugh said health officials are still seeing people come in for their first dose of vaccine.

	""About 50 per cent are first time, getting their first dose. So, we're just trying to make it as easy as possible as flexible as possible, because we really want people to get their vaccines,"" said McHugh.

	As of Wednesday, 1,478,410 doses of vaccine have been administered. Of those, 709,884 Nova Scotians have received their second dose.

	There are 173 active COVID cases in the province. Most of the new cases being reported are related to a cluster in the northern part of the province.

	""We might be seeing that for a little while just because if somebody's already been exposed they might be a close contact and you might expect them to test positive in the near future even if they haven't yet already,"" said epidemiologist Kevin Wilson. ""Probably the more concerning thing is untraced cases in the Halifax area which I think kind of flies under the radar a bit.""

	Wilson says every person who is vaccinated is a person who becomes drastically less likely to end up in hospital.          

	""The more people we get vaccinated is the more people we can keep out of the hospital and make any future outbreaks that happen much more easy to manage from a health care perspective,"" said Wilson.

	Shelly McHugh said it's never too late to get vaccinated.

	""We want to protect as many people as possible in Nova Scotia, we want to get our vaccine rates up to as high as possible so that our general population is protected, we can start to open up more and we can get back to living the way that we did before this virus happened,"" she said.

	Public Health wants to have 75 per cent of the province's entire population double dosed. Right now, 73.1 per cent of Nova Scotians are fully immunized.

	However, the province did not specify if restrictions applied to sporting events.

	""We are still sorting out exactly what the new restrictions mean and how the restriction exemption will work,"" the Oilers Entertainment Group told CTV News in an email.

	The Elks said: ""We're still working through the implications of last night's announcement by the provincial government. Once we have full clarity, we will provide an update accordingly.""

	The province's COVID-19 website says indoor retail, entertainment and recreation facilities that do not implement the Restrictions Exemption Program on Monday will have to restrict capacity to one third. As well, audience members will have to keep a two-metre distance and wear masks, and only attend with people they live with or two close contacts.

	It's unclear if that guidance applies to Rogers Place and Commonwealth Stadium. Both teams previously said they would require fans to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.

"B.C. adds 706 cases, 4 deaths in latest COVID-19 update","Sept. 17, 2021 9:55 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C.'s Ministry of Health announced 706 additional cases of COVID-19 and four related deaths on Thursday.

	There have now been 177,186 confirmed cases and 1,877 deaths since the pandemic began.

    Advertisement
    
	Most new infections continue to be found in people who are not yet fully vaccinated. Between Sept. 8 and 14, 68.1 per cent of the 3,347 new coronavirus cases were among unvaccinated people, according to the ministry.  COVID-19 in B.C.: 1st case update of the week includes 3 days of dataFull coverage at CTVNews.ca/CoronavirusIs B.C. flooding affecting the province's COVID-19 numbers?

	This is despite the fact that those who are unvaccinated - including children under age 12 who are not eligible - make up only about a quarter of the province's total population.

	Among those who are eligible, 86.3 per cent had received at least a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of Thursday, and 78.8 per cent had received both shots.

	Thursday's update brings B.C.'s rolling seven-day average for new cases back below 700 for the first time since last week. The average stands at 693, down from 702 on Wednesday.

	There are 5,844 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, a total that includes 291 people who are fighting the disease in hospital. Among the hospitalized, 134 are in intensive care.

	Of the 390 coronavirus-related hospitalizations B.C. saw between Sept. 1 and 14, 81.5 per cent were people who are unvaccinated. Only 13.6 were fully vaccinated. The remaining 4.9 per cent were partially vaccinated, a number that likely reflects their small proportion of the population relative to the fully vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.

	On Twitter, Health Minister Adrian Dix shared a breakdown of the vaccination status of people who are in intensive care, saying 93 per cent are not fully vaccinated.

	

	

	Most of the new cases reported Thursday were in the Fraser Health and Interior Health regions, which saw 203 and 213 infections, respectively.

	Elsewhere, Vancouver Coastal Health added 105 new cases on Thursday, Northern Health added 104, and Island Health added 81.

	For context, though Fraser Health and Interior Health have seen similar numbers of new cases in recent weeks, Fraser Health has more than twice as many residents as Interior Health, meaning it has seen significantly fewer cases on a per-capita basis.

	Similarly, though Vancouver Coastal Health and Northern Health saw similar raw numbers of cases on Thursday, the former has nearly 1.2 million residents, compared to the latter's 284,000.

	Three of the four deaths announced Thursday were in Fraser Health, while the fourth was in Northern Health.

	The health ministry also announced one new outbreak at Menno Terrace East, an assisted-living facility in Abbotsford. Fraser Health said Wednesday that two residents there had tested positive for COVID-19.

	Two other outbreaks - at Nicola Meadows in Merritt and Rose Wood Village in Trail - have ended, leaving B.C. with 23 active outbreaks in its health-care system, according to the ministry.

City of Regina delays proof of vaccination target date by two months,"Sept. 16, 2021 10:06 p.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	Regina city council is pushing back its target date to require proof of vaccination from people entering city facilities.

	Upon entry, visitors will have to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test as of Nov. 15, nearly two months after the original target date.

    Advertisement
    
	While Mayor Sandra Masters said she is confident the mask mandate at city facilities will keep people safe for the time being, it is possible proof of vaccination requirements are implemented sooner than the target date.
        RELATED STORIES
       City of Regina proof of vaccination target date to be pushed back to Nov. 15

	“I think with the mask mandate in place we have a little bit of peace of mind because we know masks reduce transmissibility,” Masters said.

	“If the technology is there quicker, Chris Holden with his delegated authority will adjust that timeline accordingly.”

	City manager Chris Holden said challenges with accessing QR codes is the main reason for changing the target date.

	The province is expected to roll out QR technology next week. However, Holden said it will take time for the city to work out technical details with the codes and how they will be scanned at each facility.

	Residents will need time to register for their MySaskHealthRecord in order to access the QR code, Holden said.

	According to a city report, one additional staff member will be required at most facilities in order to complete the screening required. All public city facilities will have vaccination status checked at the door.

	The city estimates it will cost $250,000 to activate proof of vaccination from Nov. 15 to the end of the year.

	During Wednesday’s city council meeting, Saskatchewan Union of Nurses president Tracy Zambory spoke in support of the vaccine requirements. She said governments need to reinstate COVID-19 restrictions, such as proof of vaccination and mandatory masking, in order to curb the fourth wave.

	“We’re on the brink of a tragedy,” Zambory said.

	Ahead of Wednesday’s city council meeting, dozens of people gathered outside City Hall to protest against proof of vaccination.

	One of the protest organizers, Tamara Lavoie, spoke to council arguing proof of vaccination goes against people’s rights and freedoms. She, like several of the other delegations, questioned Holden’s authority to make decisions regarding COVID-19 protocols.

	In April 2020, city council passed a resolution to delegate specific authorities to the city manager to make decisions to respond to COVID-19. However, council does have the right to cancel or amend the decisions.

	“I take that delegation very seriously,” Holden said, adding he is in regular talks with medical health professionals.

	“At the end of the day I am accountable. I am accountable to the mayor and the ten councillors.”

	In Saskatchewan, decisions to require proof of vaccination in businesses, organizations and institutions are left up to individual owners and governing bodies, which means city council is in its legal realm to request proof of vaccination.

	In other parts of the country, these decisions are made at the provincial level.

	""I think that the vaccine definitely helped,"" Jackson said.

	Jackson was listed as the Dolphins' starting left tackle on the team's depth chart before his stint on the COVID list, and Dolphins coach Brian Flores said he will be back in that spot this week when Miami plays at home against Buffalo.

	""That's good. It feels good,"" Jackson said. ""Throughout training camp and all the work we've put in and all the work I've put in, it's good to hear.""

	Jackson did not wish to divulge specifics about what the process of completing protocols was like.

	""I've had family members be heavily affected by COVID,"" Jackson said. ""Everybody's different. I think people have the right to hold their own opinions on the vaccine. If you don't want to get it, that's fine. But for me, I know it helped me.""

	The NFL has said more than 93% of players are vaccinated against the coronavirus. The Dolphins had two players on the COVID reserve list last week; Jackson was able to get into the game against New England for three plays, while tight end Adam Shaheen missed the game and spent more than a week away from the team.

	Shaheen, who was removed from the COVID list Wednesday, is unvaccinated.

	Across the province, masks are now mandatory for students in Grades 4 and up, plus all staff and teachers.

	Elementary schools are also expected to form cohorts.

	There are no restrictions on outdoor activity, nor are physical distancing and masks required during physical activity.

	Schools may be exempt from the mandatory mask rule if they implement an ""alternate COVID safety plan.""

	Other indoor activities – like performances or sports – are permitted with two-metre distancing.

	WORKPLACES

	The province instituted a mandatory work-from-home order on Wednesday for all employees whose physical presence isn't considered necessary for their job.

	PRIVATE SOCIAL GATHERINGS

	Fully vaccinated Albertans are limited to socializing indoors with one other household up to a maximum of 10 people. Children under 12, who are not eligible for a vaccine, are allowed to participate without restrictions.

	The same rules do not apply to Albertans who are eligible for vaccine but not immunized; unvaccinated people are not allowed to attend any indoor social gathering.

	Outdoor social gatherings are permitted to a maximum of 200 people and mandated physical distancing.

	OUTDOOR EVENTS

	Outdoor events are not subject to an audience cap, according to the rules announced Wednesday. However, two metre-distancing is required.

	PLACES OF WORSHIP

	Starting Thursday, places of worship are limited to host one third of their fire code capacity.

	Masks are also mandatory here, as well as physical distancing between households (or two close contacts for people living alone).

	OTHER CHILDREN'S ACTIVITIES

	Similar to the rules applied to indoor school activities, all other children's activities are allowed to continue with distancing, masking where possible, and symptom screening.

	Again, minors do not have to wear a mask or distance during physical activity.

	Spectator crowds for these events, however, must be capped at one third fire code capacity, and audience members must be masks and distanced from other households.

	There are no restrictions on outdoor activities.

	Day camps, too, are allowed to continue with physical distancing and masking while indoors. Overnight camps must be cohorted.

	The cancellations follow the Alberta government's declaration of a COVID-19-related state of emergency Wednesday evening as ll as new public health measures including the reintroduction of two-metre physical distancing guidelines in indoor public spaces.

	University of Calgary will resume in-person classes Sept. 20, according to an email from president and vice-chancellor Ed McCauley, but students and staff attending campus bust be fully vaccinated or have a negative test within 72 hours.

	The email said in-person classes were cancelled at U of C this week because physical distancing wasn't possible in classrooms and hallways.

	""Starting on Monday, (Sept. 20), provincial rules will require that the University of Calgary allow only those who are vaccinated or who have had a negative rapid test within 72 hours to attend campus if we do not want to be subject to two-metre physical distancing and other restrictions,"" it read.

	""Our COVIDSafe Campus program aligns to these requirements, protects our safety, and allows us to maintain operations as previously planned. More than 37,000 members of our campus community already registered in the app to come to campus, and 91.3 per cent of those community members are fully vaccinated.

	""To ensure that we can prove full compliance with government regulations in a timely fashion, everyone on campus who has attested to being vaccinated must be prepared to provide proof of vaccination status. This ability to prove vaccination is a requirement to be on campus and in the coming days, you will be asked to upload this proof into the COVIDSafe Campus application.

	The province had previously announced printable vaccine cards would be available Sept. 16 but that has been delayed until Sunday, Sept. 19.

	With Alberta's newly announced proof of vaccination program set to start on Sept. 20, Health Minister Tyler Shandro assured Albertans they'll still be able to use their existing vaccination records as proof when the new rules take effect.

	Shandro added that screenshots or photos of vaccine documents would also be acceptable.

	On Thursday morning, more than 100,000 people were trying to log on to the province's MyHealth Records website.

	Rapid testing is being accepted as an alternative to vaccination until Jan. 1, 2022, then ""it will be a requirement for all members of our community, unless they have an exception based on a protected ground, to be vaccinated to be on campus,"" read the email.

Here's what Simcoe Muskoka parents need to know

	Simcoe Muskoka's top doctor said infection rates in children under the age of 12, who are not eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, increased to 18 per cent, up from 13 per cent.

	Dr. Charles Gardner noted the fourth wave had doubled infections in children compared to any other wave during the pandemic.

	However, with schools having only been open for one week, Gardner said it's too soon to know if cases will increase.

	""We have not yet seen the impact of going back to school,"" he said. ""We have seen some cases with exposures in schools, not transmissions in schools, just individual cases,"" Gardner continued.

	Simcoe Muskoka currently has 250 active COVID-19 cases identified, including 13 infected patients admitted to hospitals.

	""One hundred per cent of our cases in the last week were due to the Delta variant,"" Gardner mentioned, adding it's in keeping with the provincial numbers.

	There are currently 199 active variant cases across the region, including 18 newly identified cases.

	Gardner said there is evidence of case counts ""plateauing"" the fourth wave.

	""It is cause for optimism,"" he said, ""but I think it's too soon to tell where the course will take us from here, but we do need to continue to be cautious.""

	WHY GET VACCINATED IF I CAN STILL GET COVID-19

	Gardner said while it's still possible to contract COVID-19, it's ""less likely to become severely ill and less likely to transmit the disease to others.""

	The medical officer of health added that unvaccinated individuals are ""37 per cent"" more likely to be admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 than those vaccinated.

	The health unit has recorded a rise in community-acquired transmission, stating as cooler temperatures force more people indoors, the numbers could surge.

	Barrie and Orillia recently announced city employees would have to show proof of vaccination status or be subject to regular COVID-19 tests and/or education on the benefits of vaccination. In some cases, disciplinary action may be taken.

	""We are responding to the pandemic of the century,"" Gardner said of employers implementing vaccine policies.

	The medical officer of health said the health unit had ""sought legal council with regards to human rights issues,"" and feels this course of action is necessary to ensure the safety of the community.

	Fans over the age of 12 coming to the game will have to provide proof they've received two doses of an approved COVID-19 vaccine including Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca or a mixture of of two. A single dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine will also be accepted to enter the stadium.

    Advertisement

	Other options include the wallet cards handed out at the time of vaccination, immunization records from public health, Armed Forces records and out of province or out of country proof of vaccination, although those could require further verification by volunteers and Saskatchewan Health Authority personnel.

	""[The] SHA will be on site at each gate for vaccine verification escalations and at help tents surrounding the stadium,"" the Riders said in a statement.

	Those over the age of 18 will need to present photo ID matching the name on the record. Fans aged 12 to 17 will have to show their record but not photo ID. Fans under 12 are exempt from the policy.

	""Stick it to COVID"" vaccine stickers will not be accepted.

	PRE-SCREENING OPTION

	Pre-screening of vaccination status will start Thursday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Friday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Rider ticket office to allow for easier access the day of the game.

	Fans who have their vaccine status verified ahead of time will receive a wristband. These fans will have a dedicated lane at Gate 1 of Mosaic Stadium. Wristbands can still be used to enter other gates but there will not be a dedicated line elsewhere.

	WHAT PARTIALLY VACCINATED AND UNVACCINATED FANS NEED TO KNOW

	An approved COVID-19 test with a negative result will be required within 72 hours of the game for anyone attending with one or zero doses of a COVID vaccine.

"N.L. reports 10 new cases of COVID-19, says vaccine passports won't be mandatory","Sept. 16, 2021 4:48 a.m. CST","
     
     ST. JOHN'S, N.L.  - 
     
    
	Newfoundland and Labrador will be rolling out a vaccine passport in October but it won't be mandatory, the province's health minister said Wednesday, despite other Atlantic provinces tightening health restrictions and requiring proof of vaccination.

	It will be up to businesses to decide whether they use the province's vaccine passport system, John Haggie told reporters, seemingly contradicting Premier Andrew Furey, who announced last week the passport system would be modelled on the one Quebec introduced -- which is mandatory.

    Advertisement
    
	Quebec requires people show proof of vaccination before they can enter businesses the government deems non-essential, such as bars, restaurants and gyms.

	Haggie on Wednesday suggested any confusion ""may be a matter of semantics."" He said Newfoundland and Labrador's passport system will use the same technology as Quebec's.

	""My understanding was the Quebec app was being used -- the Quebec software that is in the process of being adapted to Newfoundland and Labrador's IT infrastructure in terms of the use of the vaccine passport,"" Haggie said.

	His remarks came as New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs on Wednesday said his province would require residents to produce proof of COVID-19 vaccination to access services such as indoor festivals, bars, restaurants and gyms beginning next week.

	Also Wednesday, Prince Edward Island Premier Dennis King reintroduced a provincewide mask mandate and imposed point-of-entry testing for kids aged eight to 12.

	And while Haggie said his province's proof-of-vaccination system will be voluntary, that may change under special circumstances.

	""We have not mandated vaccines for anybody,"" Haggie said. ""There may, depending on epidemiology and circumstances of case counts where public health recommends we go to a lockdown in a certain area, I think under those circumstances there may be conditions where using the vaccine passport could be mandatory under a (special measures order).""

	The province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, reported 10 new cases of COVID-19 Wednesday and 49 active infections across the province. Nineteen infections are now associated with a cluster in the northern Newfoundland town of Roddickton, where just 60 per cent of eligible residents have received a first dose of vaccine, Fitzgerald said.

	By contrast, online government data shows nearly 78 per cent of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians 12 and up were fully vaccinated and more than 87 per cent have received at least one dose of vaccine.

	Another cluster in the eastern region of the province has been linked to large indoor gatherings where people were not wearing masks, Fitzgerald said.

	""While I understand that it is concerning to see emerging clusters in cases, it is expected with the fourth wave still underway outside the province,"" she said. ""Atlantic Canada as a whole is starting to see the impacts of the fourth wave, with 327 new cases reported across the region in the last week.""

	Public health officials are watching the situation closely and are ready to reintroduce travel restrictions or other measures if necessary, Fitzgerald said. The province will also offer a third dose of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to residents who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, as per the latest advice from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, she added.

	This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 15, 2021.

	P.E.I. previously lifted their mandatory mask restriction on July 9.

	“We still remain in a very fortunate position here in Prince Edward Island. The steps we’ve taken will allow P.E.I. to stay open, to have our kids in school, our health services interrupted, to have family visiting loved ones in long-term care centres, and our ultimate goal is to stay open while keeping Islanders safe, and have as normal a life as we can have during this fourth wave of COVID-19 in our country,” said P.E.I.

	""In addition, staff at nursing homes and adult residential facilities will be required to either be fully vaccinated or wear a mask and be tested regularly for COVID-19,"" Public Health said in a news release.

	They are specifically targeting those between the ages of 12 and 50. About 65 per cent of those people are fully vaccinated, said Higgs. Enforcement will be monitoring compliance and, where necessary, enforce the new rules.

	Higgs said the COVID-19 vaccine can help combat the virus, but more people must get vaccinated to provide the population with better protection.

	""There will be consequences,"" Higgs said to those who don't follow the rules. ""Now we have a solution. Take advantage of the solution.""

	He said staff will be required to provide proof of vaccination. Those who don't will have to submit to regular COVID testing and provide a negative result.

	Though the province stopped short of calling it a vaccine passport, proof of immunization for Albertans will be made available starting Thursday.

	In a news release, Health Minister Tyler Shandro encouraged Albertans to use MyHealth Records so they can access their immunization records.

	""More Albertans are signing up for this tool every day to access their health information, and if you haven’t done so already, I encourage you to sign up now,"" he said.

	Despite the introduction of a card-sized COVID-19 vaccination record, the province will not be mandating vaccines, leaving businesses to implement their own policies if they so choose.

	“If it is the choice of each individual business or client, then you don’t have the consistency across the board,” said Stephen Klintberg Nagy, co-founder of Rockethouse Productions.

	“So there is still the rollercoaster effect of anybody who wants to access your business or event.”

	Klintberg Nagy says a client cancelled a conference with his company this week due to Alberta’s decision making in regards to COVID-19.

	He said a conference that typically sees about 1,500 people was shrunk to 500, and then eventually 100 people -- who were fully vaccinated – but has since been entirely cancelled.

	“If things were standardized, it makes things much, much easier and much better for communication,” Klintberg Nagy said.

	Health policy expert Lorian Hardcastle from the University of Calgary believes the province did not go far enough by providing a vaccination record.  

	“What would have been better would be a provincially driven manner where they clearly list the businesses that must require it, and those who can’t require it because they are essential,” Hardcastle said.

	“There are pockets of the province where infections are high and vaccine rates are high and adoption there could be low.”

	The province said Albertans should print their records off before any event that requires them, such as concerts and hockey games.

	“MyHealth Records may experience high traffic volume before major events and long weekends,” read a statement from the province.

	Officials say COVID-19 immunization records have been available since December 2020 for Albertans aged 14 and older.

	More than 110,000 Albertans have created their MyHealth Records account in the last three weeks, bringing the total number of users to about 910,000.

Health officials bracing for an unpredictable flu season,"Sept. 15, 2021 8:44 p.m. CST","
     
     Waterloo - 
     
    
	As the typical flu season remains on the horizon, there’s little indication of what it could bring this year.

	“It’s a difficult question because of all of the COVID measures that the public and our local community is currently taking, it can modify what our flu season looks like quite dramatically,” said Kristy Wright, Region of Waterloo Public Health's vaccine-preventable disease manager.

    Advertisement
    
	Public health measures in place for the pandemic are credited for a drop in flu cases last year, but experts say the season ahead is unpredictable.

	The health unit confirmed there were no reported influenza cases in Waterloo Region in 2020.

	“We are bracing for a bit more of a busy flu season this year just knowing that,” said Wright.

	She says because of no cases in 2020, immunity may also be down.

	“Some immunity can carry over from season to season and because we had no flu cases last season, people wouldn’t have had the opportunity to do that,"" she said.

	While experts say the number of cases could be down again, they are still encouraging people to get a flu shot when they become available.

	That’s usually by the end of September for those who are high-risk.

	“We need to do the best that we can to prevent influenza from adding into what we are already experiencing,” said Connie Phillion, a Kitchener pharmacy owner. “Flu shot and preventative measures is really our best bet to protect ourselves.”

	There are also timelines to consider if you’re getting both a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu shot.

	“Wait 28 days after having a COVID vaccine to receive your flu vaccine and if you receive your flu vaccine first and you still need to receive a COVID vaccine, then wait 14 days,” said Wright.

	Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician, said the wait time is because if someone has a negative result or has some side effects to a vaccine, they would like to know which vaccine it’s related to.

	The flu shot will be available at doctor’s offices and in pharmacies in Waterloo Region.

	Nova Scotia also plans to move into its final stage of its COVID-19 reopening plan on that date after it was delayed from its original start date of Sept. 15.

	“Businesses have suffered and born the brunt of the pandemic and the shut downs in the last 18 months,” said Sullivan. “So, now it’s time to shift the responsibility of the individual to the individual. If individuals choose not to be vaccinated they should understand they are choosing not to enter non-essential businesses after Oct. 4.”

	Tim Rissesco, the executive director of the Downtown Dartmouth Business Commission, said they realize some people aren’t happy with the vaccine protocol.

	“They are confident in the decisions that they’ve made and they’re confident that their customers in the local area will continue to support them and see their decisions as being responsible decisions to make for the health and welfare of everybody,” said Rissesco.

	The president of the Halifax Wanderers – a soccer team in Halifax – is expecting a full house for their next home game. In a live COVID-19 news conference on Tuesday, Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health, said this is permitted as long as fans are vaccinated and wearing masks.

	The team says it's a policy they have already had in place for a couple of weeks.

	“We’re doing it really for our fans so when our fans are here they feel safe. We were asked by many of them if we could institute something like this, so that’s why we did it. We thought it was the responsible thing to do,” said Derek Martin, president of the Halifax Wanderers.

	Martin said for now, they are also accepting proof of a negative COVID-19 test as long as it is completed within 48 hours prior to the match.

	That rule will be phased out when the province moves into Phase 5, at which fans will need to show proof of vaccination to have access to the Wanderers grounds.

	Meanwhile, the mandatory vaccination policy for City of Windsor workers has been approved by city council.

	Mayor Drew Dilkens says the next step involves consultation with the union.

	The hope is to have something ready for final approval in the next week.

	By the end of November, workers will not not be allowed in the workplace if they are unvaccinated.

	“There’s enough data out there to prove these vaccines are safe and so we have to do our part as an employer to say we have to take care of our staff,” says Dilkens. “We need to provide comfort to the public that is coming into City Hall and do everything we can to help make sure we’re moving out of this COVID fog together.”

Sask. nurses and physicians respond to province's 'wrongheaded decision' to redeploy health-care workers,"Sept. 15, 2021 8:31 a.m. CST","
     
     SASKATOON - 
     
    
	On Monday, the Government of Saskatchewan issued an emergency order to redirect and reschedule health-care workers to COVID-19 hotspots.

	It is an attempt to relieve some of the pressure caused by staffing shortages. Saskatchewan set a new record of 506 new cases on Tuesday.

	Speaking to the mental stress and fatigue experienced in his emergency room at Royal University Hospital, Dr. James Stempien says nurses and physicians are having burnout related issues watching more and more patients come into crowded emergency departments, which makes it more difficult to provide care.

	Being redeployed, he says, could add to that level of stress.

	“Our emergency nurses and physicians are very resilient people, so for them to make that decision to go help an area that needed extra staffing, they would do the best they could, but sure you can imagine there would be a stress involved.”

	Saskatchewan Union of Nurses president Tracy Zambory says a redeployment of staff would be much more effective if it was paired with a reinstatement of public health orders.

	“This is a wrongheaded decision. We can't just have a partial state of emergency that only affects how workers are moved around in the province.

	“We need that vaccine passport government wide. They need to support that and they need to institute it, and we need the mandatory masking in indoor public places.

	“We need to look at the numbers of people gathering, we need to talk once again about the size of people's bubbles. We need to talk about how often people go out.”

	Zambory says health-care workers are feeling demoralized, devalued and despondent. She cites the COVID-19 situation facing the province of Alberta as an example of what she’d like to avoid.

	“Their numbers are so horrific that they've reached capacity in the system. The last thing that any health care provider wants to do, any registered nurse wants to do, is have to decide who gets care and who doesn't. We can't have this in this province.”

	The Saskatchewan Health Authority and health sector unions did have a letter of understanding that allowed for labour mobility, but it expired when restrictions were lifted.

	“It's another case of where the government is failing to do the things that they can do to bring the numbers under control,” said NDP labour critic Carla Beck.

	“The government is not keeping up their end of the bargain, but instead is taking heavy handed action against those very health care workers who are telling us they're feeling demoralized and disrespected.”

	PROTESTS OUTSIDE HOSPITALS

	NDP leader Ryan Meili called on the Government of Saskatchewan to put an end to protests outside of hospitals on Tuesday.

	“We're calling on this government to do the right thing, to outlaw protests at hospitals and clinics and pharmacies. To stop the harassment and intimidation of patients, their families, and the health care workers working so hard to take care of them,” he said.

	“Health-care workers aren't making policies, government is,” said NDP justice critic Nicole Sarauer. “These protests should be at the legislature, not at the hospital.”

	“They could have safe zones around hospitals and health facilities, ensuring protests are held well clear of health care facilities.”

	Zambory says SUN respects people’s democratic right to protest, but believes there’s a responsibility that comes along with that right.

	“It is disgusting what they think that they can do, these protesters. It's disgusting that they think that they have the right to actually spit on health care workers going in, or demean individuals who are requiring important health interventions from going into the hospital. These people are despicable.”

	Stempien says the protests, which he calls “ridiculous”, send a damaging message about health-care in the province.

	But he’s seen several unvaccinated people change their tune after contracting COVID-19 and receiving treatment for it.

	“The most people I see, when they're in the emergency department and quite unwell and are appreciative of the care they're getting, have a bit of buyers’ regret for not getting the vaccine,” he said.

	The Ministry of Health and Saskatchewan Health Authority have not responded to a request for comment.

	Marskell said there will be a learning curve but admitted they are ready for it.

	St. Marys Golf Club said about 60 per cent of their business is weddings.

	“It’s going to create a significant amount of complication and frustration for our guests,” said Stratten. “When people start showing up, a piece of paper, going to start showing us emails on the phone and that sort of thing, it’s going to make it all very confusing.”

	The province said a QR code that will be shown on phones and an accompanying app should be available by Oct. 22.

	The St. Marys Golf Club manager said he is worried the issue of vaccine passports might turn violent, as they’ve been hearing from concerned residents on the phone.

	“For example, they said I would hate to see a staff member get punched in the face because of because they’re asking for somebody’s health record,” said Stratten.

Controversial new Medical Officer of Health confirmed in Haldimand-Norfolk,"Sept. 15, 2021 6:49 a.m. CST","
     
     KITCHENER - 
     
    
	The board of health for Haldimand and Norfolk counties has confirmed the appointment of it’s new Acting Medical Officer of Health, despite the controversy that surrounds him.

	The board held a meeting Monday night to make the confirmation and discuss the issues around Dr. Matt Strauss, like his highly critical views on lockdowns as public health measures to fight COVID-19.

    Advertisement
    
	Social media posts from the assistant professor at Queens University, which expressed these opinions, led to calls for his removal as the top doctor in Haldimand and Norfolk.

	""It’s essential in the public health debate to keep an open mind and look at things through different perspectives,” said Norfolk County Mayor Kristal Chopp.

	Tweets from Dr. Strauss, like one at the end of August that read “live free or die,"" have some concerned over the direction he will take for the area.

	""The callous regard for the seriousness of this disease is what gives me pause,"" said Jacob Shelly, a health ethics, law and policy professor at Western University. ""I would like Dr. Strauss to comment on his views on Florida. I would still like to know if he thinks De Santis is a hero for taking that approach because lockdowns maybe are not the solution but there is a lot of evidence that opening up freely without restrictions hasn't worked.""

	“The local medical officer of health does not have the authority to overturn provincial public health orders,” said Chopp. “So how I would reassure my own constituents, if the province decided to issue another lockdown or mask mandate, is that all those things would apply equally here in Haldimand and Norfolk counties.”

	After the lengthy closed session, which included input from legal counsel, the appointment of Dr. Strauss passed eight to one.

	Chopp says she is also not convinced lockdowns are an effective public health policy and welcomes Dr. Strauss and his view.

	“I look forward to someone with Dr. Strauss’ background to be there around the table with the other 34 Medical Officers of Health and, in a fact-based manner, challenge some of those assumptions,” she said.

	Dr. Strauss officially assumes the role Tuesday morning.

	He was expected to address Norfolk County council to explain his vision and the reasons behind the controversial tweets but declined the opportunity until next week.

	In a self-published post, Dr. Strauss stated he has used social media to criticize government policies he disagrees, at times using sarcasm or eye-catching analogies. He says in his new office he won't do this anymore.

	Dr. Strauss also stated if there is a disagreement with government policy in his new role it will be handled professionally and with respect to the authority of the province.

	On Tuesday, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Kieran Moore, made it clear the province will step in if there's an issue.

	""If I have any concerns regarding safety and health of that community, I can step in as the Chief Medical Officer of Health and will,"" he said.

	Dr. Strauss has repeatedly stated he is pro-vaccine, with his critics saying he has the ability to bring the unvaccinated crowd on board.

	""I would like to see Dr. Strauss speak to those who are supporting him, who are maybe ideologically aligned with his views on anti-lockdown but who are also anti-vax passport and anti-mask, because those things we may need in the interim to address COVID,"" Shelly said.

	It's the home stretch for federal parties as election day draws closer and candidates in the Brandon-Souris riding are looking to make the most out of the time left.

	Traditionally blue, the Conservatives are looking to hold down the riding, but other parties are hoping to leverage the changing demographic and are keen for an upset.

	Incumbent Conservative candidate Larry Maguire is hitting the federal campaign trail for the fourth time.

	""It's an opportunity to be able to make sure we recover from COVID-19. It's the most important issue we are facing and our plan will take care of it,"" said Maguire.

	A veteran politician, Maguire has spent most of his life in the riding.

	""Well, I grew up from Brandon-Souris about 45 minutes southwest of the city in a little town called Elgin, went to university here. I've farmed here all my life until I got into politics,"" Maguire said.

	Maguire first ran as a Progressive Conservative in 1993. He lost that election and moved to provincial politics, where he served as an MLA for many years.

	Maguire made the switch back to federal politics when he won in the 2013 by-election.

	The second biggest riding in the province, Brandon-Souris offers some challenges.

	According to Curtis Brown, a political researcher at Probe Research, Brandon-Souris has a changing demographic with both rural and urban voters.

	""So there is definitely some more liberal or leftist-centre support provincially,"" noted Brown. ""At times, the NDP won in Brandon itself.""

	Looking to cash in on that support is NDP candidate Whitney Hodgins.

	Hodgins has been a mental health and disability advocate in the area for more than a decade and said she'd champion those issues if elected.

	""Definitely, mental health and disability issues are top priority for me, especially right now in the pandemic. I'm also interested in the economic recovery,"" she said.

	Also on the Brandon-Souris ballot are Liberal candidate Linda Branconnier and PPC candidate Tylor Baer.

	""If you're tired of the status quo, I'd say look into the PPC because we are doing politics differently and intend to serve the people first,"" said Baer, whose platform is based on axing vaccine passports and mandates.

	With election day looming, Brown said the other parties like the PPC will make things more interesting in the riding.

	""The question is whether the PPC might peel off any support from the Conservatives, but they also might get support from people who have voted Green in the past or who just do it as a none of the above sort of thing,"" said Brown.

	According to Brown, the Brandon-Souris riding is also unique in that the Green Party does not have a candidate running for the area.

'WE ARE HEADED FOR CAMPS'  Several hundred protesters rallied outside Foothills Meiccal Centre on Monday, calling for an end to mandated vaccines.  “We know where we are headed as the unvaxxed, we are headed for camps and we’re standing for the freedom of every Canadian,” said protester Trevor Simpson.  Simpson said he believed that everyone has a choice to take the jab or not, but it should not be mandated by governments or workplaces.

     VANCOUVER - 
     
    
	Opponents of B.C.'s vaccine card system staged another protest outside Vancouver city hall on Monday, hours after the proof-of-vaccination requirement came into effect.

	Hundreds of people gathered outside the building in the early afternoon, some carrying signs reading ""No Medical Apartheid"" and ""My Body, My Choice"" to protest the provincial health officer order barring unvaccinated individuals from non-essential activities such as dining in at restaurants and going to the movies.

	The protest was a fraction of the size of an initial demonstration against the vaccine card system that saw thousands crowd around Vancouver General Hospital earlier this month, but had a similar number of attendees to another held last Wednesday.

	Organizers of the so-called ""National Health Freedom Movement,"" which is behind several simultaneous protests planned across the country on Monday, described the event as a silent vigil to honour those affected by measures put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19.

	Participants were encouraged to bring flowers, pictures, cards and letters, and to share stories of loss.

	Earlier in the day, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau announced that his party, if re-elected, would make it a crime to block access to buildings that provide health-care services or to intimidate the employees who work in those settings.

	“To know that a nurse, going into a late shift, crossing a parking lot, might be afraid that there’s going to be someone there to spit on her or shout obscenities at her – that’s not OK,” Trudeau said during a campaign stop in Vancouver.

	Monday's protest was supposed to take place outside of Vancouver General again, but the group made a last-minute decision to move in the face of public criticism.

	The protestors have claimed to support health-care workers who don't want to be vaccinated, but the overwhelming reaction from those within the sector has been scathing.

	Following the first demonstration, a worker at Kelowna General Hospital went as far as to describe a protest in her city as a ""disgusting, misguided display of disrespect and ignorance.""

	Christina Gower, a psychiatric nurse in Vancouver, told CTV News watching the Sept. 1 demonstration felt like a ""slap in the face,"" and said morale was already an issue with workers stretched thin dealing with the influx of patients during the fourth wave.

	Health Minister Adrian Dix called the protests one of the most frustrating challenges facing officials at this stage in the pandemic.

	""Talking to health-care workers who are dealing with the reality of this situation in our public hospitals in and around the province, it is a time of very, very high risk for COVID-19 for anyone who's unvaccinated. We see this in the numbers. They are staggering,"" Dix said in an interview with CTV Morning Live on Monday.

	""And it's not like people who are demonstrating are also saying, 'Well, we're concerned about vaccination but we're taking care to be masked and so on.' Their approach is not, I think, the right approach.""

	Still, Dix said his approach and that of other health officials is to ""continue to be positive,"" and called the new B.C. vaccine card a part of that strategy. He said the system allows the vast majority of people to continue doing things they couldn’t earlier in the pandemic, such as dining in restaurants, while those who refuse vaccination will simply have to wait.

	Prior to the start of Monday's demonstration, the Vancouver Police Department said it supports the public's right to protest – but that officers will also balance that right with the need to maintain public safety and prevent the blocking of ""critical infrastructure,"" including hospitals.

	""While we support people's right to assemble and express themselves, this doesn't give anybody permission to harass or endanger others, it doesn't give anybody permission to block emergency vehicles or to block people's ability to move around the city,"" Sgt. Steve Addison said.

	""Anybody who breaks the law or endangers these public could be arrested.""

	NEW HEALTH ORDER

	Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced a new health order Monday that makes vaccination a mandatory condition of employment at all health-care facilities across B.C.

	""This includes all workers, students, physicians, residents, contractors and volunteers who work in a health-care facility, including contracted facilities which are accessible to patients and where they receive services,"" said Henry.

The high-risk group includes organ transplant recipients, those being treated for some forms of cancer and those who have received bone marrow or stem cell transplants.

	Henry said 120,000 other British Columbians who are considered moderately immunocompromised may be asked to get a third vaccine dose later this month or in early October.

	In a news release on Monday morning, regional officials said the disclosure must be made by Sept. 27. Anyone who isn't vaccinated or chooses not to share their vaccination status will need to undergo education on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination and take part in a rapid antigen testing program.

	“Our staff are the greatest asset we have at the region and we value the critical work each and every employee carries out on a daily basis as we serve this community,” Chief Administrative Officer Bruce Lauckner said. “This policy puts the health and wellbeing of staff first. As we continue to move through a fourth wave of COVID-19 in Waterloo Region, we want to ensure our employees can continue to serve this community safely and effectively.”

	The region has also implemented a number of other safety protocols at its locations, including Plexiglas barriers, hand sanitizing stations, mask protocols and daily self-screening for all staff members.

	""We are already faced with a labour shortage right across the sector. We know hundreds of employees across B.C. have indicated they do not intend to get vaccinated, and several of those people are talking about leaving their jobs and going to work in the hospitals where there is no requirement to be fully vaccinated,"" said Mike Klassen with the BCCPA.

"Sask. doctor, NDP say the province's new COVID-19 measures don't go far enough","Sept. 12, 2021 12:34 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	The Saskatchewan government introduced new public health measures on Friday aimed at protecting the health care system’s capacity amid surging COVID-19 cases, but some are saying the new orders don’t go far enough to quell the fourth wave sweeping the province.

	The province reinstated a self-isolation order for COVID-19 positive residents and will be reducing some health care services to attempt to lessen the stress on the system.

	The same day, the province confirmed 432 new cases of COVID-19 – the second highest number on record and highest number in 2021.

       Sask. reinstates mandatory self-isolation, health care service reductions as COVID-19 cases rise Sask. reports highest count of new COVID-19 cases this year Doctor, teachers’ federation disappointed with lack of COVID-19 measures as cases spike in Sask. schools

	Dr. Alexander Wong, an infectious disease physician in Regina, said the new measures are disappointing.

	“There’s a need for additional restrictions and mandates to be put in place to try and protect our health system,” said Dr. Wong.

	“If we don’t have critical care capacity and you need it…you might not live. That’s the reality of where we’ve at right now.”

	Dr. Wong said residents just have to look over the border to Manitoba to see the impact of public health restrictions like a universal mask mandate and a slightly higher vaccine uptake.

	As of Friday, there are 75 COVID-19 patients in Manitoba hospitals and 539 active cases – compared to Saskatchewan’s 3,573.

	Dr. Wong acknowledged Manitoba had a horrific surge of the virus in in May. Hospitalized patients were sent out of province to Ontario and Saskatchewan at that time, but Dr. Wong said Manitoba might have to soon return the favour to its western neighbours.

	Saskatchewan NDP leader Ryan Meili, who is also a family doctor, said health care workers across the province are exhausted and the new restrictions aren’t enough to bring any relief.

	“We have no serious public health orders in place, and today that didn’t change,” said Meili.

	During a press conference Friday, Premier Scott Moe defended the new restrictions and stood by the province’s vaccine-based strategy.

	“We know that these are only interim measures that will increase out healthcare capacity in the short term, so we must continue to focus our efforts on increasing the efficacy, the availability and the uptake of vaccines,” Moe said.

	“Some of you may be wondering why I'm not imposing broad restrictions and mandates here today and I said before restrictions are a stopgap measure. They were always intended to be temporary, and they were to get us to a point where vaccines are largely available and accessible and they are today.”

	Both Meili and Dr. Wong said the province should implement all of the terms laid out in letter doctors wrote to provincial leaders two weeks ago.

	The letter, which was written on behalf of provincial medical health officers, recommended a universal mask mandate and proof of immunization requirements for non-essential services, along with several other suggestions to combat the spread of COVID-19.

	“[Scott Moe] chose to give up on healthcare workers and ignore their advice,” said Meili.

	“We’re doing the worst and this premier is choosing to do the least in response.”

	Dr. Wong said he will keep pushing for more restrictions to avoid getting to a place where doctors are forced to triage patients and make life and death decisions.

	“I'm not going to sit and speculate as to what the motivations are for these decisions, or lack of decision, that are being made. There's clearly some political component here, which I probably will never understand,” Dr. Wong said.

	“But that doesn't change the reality that I think that we have to continue to push for what we believe and what we know is right, and to just allow, willingly, people to suffer and die is not acceptable.”

9 COVID-19 deaths recorded Friday in B.C.'s deadliest day since February,"Sept. 11, 2021 6:34 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C.'s Ministry of Health has announced 820 additional cases of COVID-19, as well as nine related deaths.

	The nine deaths are the most reported in a 24-hour period since Feb. 25.

    Advertisement

	There have now been 173,158 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,856 deaths in B.C. since the pandemic began.

	Currently, there are 5,850 active cases of COVID-19 in the province. That includes 281 people who are battling the disease in hospital, 135 of them in intensive care units.

	The largest share of the newly announced cases was found in the Fraser Health region, where 264 infections were reported.

	Another 253 cases were found in Interior Health, which has been the hotspot of B.C.'s fourth wave of the pandemic.

	Notably, though they've recorded similar numbers of new cases over the last few weeks, Fraser Health and Interior Health have vastly different populations. Fraser Health is home to more than twice as many people as Interior Health, meaning far fewer people are contracting the coronavirus in the Fraser Health region on a per-capita basis.

	Elsewhere, Friday saw 112 new cases in Vancouver Coastal Health, 101 in Northern Health and 90 in Island Health.

	The nine deaths were reported across four different regions, with three in Vancouver Coastal Health, three in Interior Health, two in Northern Health and one in Island Health.

	Health officials have blamed B.C.'s fourth wave on the highly transmissible Delta variant, which has spread especially rapidly through unvaccinated populations in the province.

	Of the 4,661 COVID-19 infections reported between Sept. 2 and 8, 69.8 per cent were found in unvaccinated people. This, despite the fact that unvaccinated people make up less than a third of B.C.'s total population, and an even smaller percentage of those ages 12 and older who are eligible to be vaccinated.

	As of Friday, 85.5 per cent of people in that eligible age group had received at least a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 78 per cent had received both shots.

	Beginning on Monday, proof of a first dose of vaccine will be required for participation in certain non-essential activities, including dining in restaurants and working out in gyms.

	By Oct. 24, proof of full vaccination will be required in such settings. More information on the B.C. Vaccine Card that will serve as proof of vaccination for B.C. residents can be found here and on the provincial government website.

	""The BC Vaccine Card being rolled out by the provincial government is for patrons to access certain venues and events and does not apply to workers at these businesses,"" WorkSafeBC says on its website.

	Some employers will be required to collect vaccination status, like operators of long-term care and assisted living facilities. 

	""However for other employers, checking vaccination status of their workers is not currently a public health requirement or a WorkSafeBC requirement,"" WorkSafeBC's online guide says. ""Similar to mandatory vaccination policies, employers should seek legal advice when deciding to implement such policies.""

	For those other employers, B.C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, reiterated they can choose to require workers to be vaccinated.

	""It is up to each business. The employer-employee relationship is a different one from somebody who is participating in an event or going to a business or restaurant,"" she said late last month, when the program was announced.

	""We have been working with WorkSafeBC to support businesses in looking at their COVID safety plans, the communicable disease plans and where vaccination fits in.""

	Henry said the health ministry will continue to support businesses as they make their plans, especially ""public-facing businesses where vaccination is really important to protect staff.""

	CTV News Vancouver has reached out to the health ministry for further comments. 

	As of late Thursday morning, 1,101,754 people had accessed their vaccine card. About 85 per cent of eligible B.C. residents have had at least one COVID-19 shot. Nearly 78 per cent are fully vaccinated.

	Since the pandemic began, there have been 172,338 confirmed coronavirus cases in B.C. and 1,847 people have died.

	Most of the latest infections were found in the Interior Health and Fraser Health regions, which recorded 253 and 233 new cases, respectively.

	Notably, though the regions' new caseloads have been similar in recent weeks, Fraser Health has more than double the population of Interior Health, meaning far fewer people are contracting the coronavirus in the Fraser Health region on a per-capita basis.

	Elsewhere, Vancouver Coastal Health saw 123 new infections, Northern Health saw 98 and Island Health recorded 65. Two of the new cases announced Thursday were found in people who normally reside outside Canada.

	Of the five deaths announced Thursday, three were in Fraser Health, one in Island Health and one in Northern Health.

	For weeks, health officials have described B.C.'s fourth wave of COVID-19 cases as a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated.""

	As of Thursday, 85.3 per cent of eligible British Columbians ages 12 and older in the province have received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 77.8 per cent of that age group has received both shots.

	Though unvaccinated people represent a relatively small portion of the province's total population, they continue to account for the majority of new infections and hospitalizations.

	Of the 4,694 cases recorded in B.C. from Sept. 1 to 7, unvaccinated people accounted for 70.2 per cent of them, according to the health ministry.

	During the same period, the province recorded 301 cases per 100,000 unvaccinated residents, compared to roughly 85 per 100,000 partially vaccinated residents and just 26 per 100,000 fully vaccinated residents.

	The per-100,000 figures are adjusted for age, according to the ministry.

	Hospitalizations and intensive care admissions for COVID-19 in B.C. follow a similar pattern. Earlier in the day Thursday, Health Minister Adrian Dix shared a breakdown of ICU cases by age and vaccination status, saying that of the 130 people currently in intensive care with the coronavirus, 111 of them are unvaccinated. 

	Everyone who is under age 50 and is in intensive care with COVID-19 in B.C. is unvaccinated, Dix said.

	The Canadian Institute for Health Information has determined the cost of caring for a patient with COVID-19 in hospital is roughly four times that of treatment for influenza and triple the cost of a heart attack.

	The report looked at January 2020 through to March of this year, so it doesn't account for the hospital costs associated with Canada's third and fourth waves of the pandemic.

	A kidney transplant is the only treatment the report found to be more costly at about $27,000 and those procedures involve a surgical team.

	Admissions to intensive care units double to an average of $50,000 per COVID-19 patient, roughly double the cost of emergency room admission.

	The estimated total cost of all COVID-19 hospital stays in Canada —excluding Quebec —is $1 billion.

	The report found that one-in-five patients came through the emergency room and soon transferred to the ICU.

	A Calgary emergency medicine doctor says ICU stays are expensive because of the number of highly trained staff, complex equipment and medical supplies required to keep people alive.

	""I don't wish anyone to need the experience of the intensive care unit,"" said Dr. Raj Bhardwaj. ""It's called intensive care for a reason.""

	He says public health measures and interventions could have prevented the number of cases that led to severe outcomes and the associated hospitalization costs.

	""Really, that's a health care cost of not providing good public health care and if public health is doing a good job, none of these costs are accrued. None of these people get sick, none of these people die, none of these families are affected when public health does a good job.""

	He says vaccine uptake must increase in order to help alleviate the pressure on Alberta hospitals and slow the spread of the virus — in addition to continuing to test, trace and isolate for positive cases.

	""Go get vaccinated. It works. It keeps you out of the ICU.""

B.C. opens door for medical exemptions to vaccine card in 'extremely rare' cases,"Sept. 9, 2021 10:07 p.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C. has now indicated medical exemptions to the incoming vaccine card requirement may be allowed, but only in “extremely rare” cases.

	As of Wednesday evening, more than 700,000 people in B.C. had accessed their vaccine card, which will have to be shown as proof at certain non-essential businesses and activities as of Sept. 13. Proof of full vaccination, including being two weeks past a second shot, will be required as of Oct. 24.

	When the measure was first announced last month, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said there would not be exemptions for people who are not able to get immunized for medical reasons.

	“This is a temporary measure that’s getting us through a risky period where we know people who are unvaccinated are at a greater risk, both of contracting and spreading this virus,” she said at the time. “Those rare people who have a medical reason why they can’t be immunized...they will not be able to attend those events during this period.”

	The lack of medical exemptions raised concerns for Disability Alliance BC. Co-executive director Helaine Boyd told CTV Vancouver Wednesday they’ve seen social isolation become exacerbated for people with disabilities throughout the pandemic, and “this is just another example.”

	“We fully believe that anyone who can get vaccinated should get vaccinated. However, we do think that there is blatant discrimination being made,” she said. “We have heard from some individuals who have tried to get vaccinated, but cannot, because they have not gotten approval from their doctor or their medical professional.”

	Boyd said they’d like to see the province work with them and other groups serving marginalized populations to help develop an exemption policy.

	“I think it’s completely possible to find a way to navigate between protecting the overall safety of the population while also upholding and protecting the human rights of those affected by this,” she said.

	“It is a small amount of people with disabilities who are affected, which in our mind, means that it wouldn’t affect the whole B.C. population and the B.C. government’s goal of protecting the wider population against COVID-19.”

	Boyd added her group’s message is distinct from those who have staged protests against the vaccine card.

	“We don’t really want our statement to be perverted by the anti-vax movement,” Boyd said. “There are people who have tried to get vaccinated and they can’t because of medical reasons and they don’t have a choice in the matter...whereas those who have been protesting, they do have a choice. They’re just choosing not to be vaccinated.”

	In an email to CTV, the Ministry of Health indicated the province now seems to be opening the door to some exceptions.

	“There will be an exemption process in place for extremely rare circumstances, involving a person’s doctor and the Office of the Provincial Health Officer,” the ministry said. “However, these instances will be extremely rare.”

	The ministry added Dr. Bonnie Henry has said those who are currently unvaccinated, for any reason, the kinds of indoor settings eligible for the vaccine card are “high risk” right now.

	The vaccine card measure will mean people will be required to produce proof of vaccination for activities like dining out at restaurants, going to the movies, attending indoor ticketed concerts and sporting events, or working out at a fitness centre or gym. It will not apply to retail or essential services including groceries and health care. The order will be in place until the end of January, with the possibility for an extension.

'Boiling point': Alberta doctors warn of health system collapse as COVID-19 cases climb,"Sept. 9, 2021 8:59 p.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Alberta's health-care system is on the verge of collapse, warns a group of physicians who are pleading with the government to strengthen public health measures to fend off a relentless fourth wave of COVID-19.

	Dr. Shazma Mithani, an emergency room physician in Edmonton, said a staffing crisis, overwhelmed intensive care units and mixed messaging from the province has created a “dire” situation.

    Advertisement
    
	Her biggest fear, she said, is that doctors will need to triage patients should hospitalizations continue to mount.

	“We don't want to have to make these decisions where we're choosing who gets to have (intensive) care or not. And we're getting closer and closer to that every day,” Mithani said in an interview.

	Alberta Health Services, the province's health-care provider, said in a statement Wednesday there were 258 intensive care beds in the province, which includes 85 added spaces. It said intensive care unit capacity sat at 87 per cent - just slightly below a seven-day average of 91 per cent.

	Mithani said the government needs to listen to frontline health-care workers and implement stronger public health restrictions to prevent the health system from crumbling.

	“This is much, much worse than I think people understand,” she said. “We, as health-care workers, are telling you that things are very dire, that ICU beds are running out, that we are stretched very thin in terms of our hospital capacity.”

	On Friday, the Government of Alberta reinstated an indoor mask mandate for public spaces and an alcohol sales curfew at 10 p.m. It also announced a $100 incentive for unvaccinated Albertans who get their shots in response to an intensifying crisis.

	Dr. Ilan Schwartz, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta, said those efforts are “all but meaningless.”

	“They are worse than doing nothing at all because now it is going to delay the government from taking more definitive action,” Schwartz said during a panel discussion Wednesday with advocacy group Protect Our Province.

	Dr. Darren Markland, an intensive care physician in Edmonton who was also on the panel, said the government should consider vaccine passports and a circuit-breaker lockdown, which is a tight set of restrictions for a limited amount of time to curb ongoing transmission of COVID-19.

	Relying solely on vaccinations won't reign in a growing fourth wave driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, added Mithani.

	It takes at least six weeks for people to build full immunity against COVID-19 because vaccine shots need to be separated by a month and then allow another two weeks to develop protection.

	In the meantime, there are no signs COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are slowing. There were 647 Albertans in hospital Wednesday due to COVID-19, with 147 of those patients in intensive care. Hospitalizations jumped by 7.5 per cent from Tuesday. Another 18 people died in a 24-hour period.

	The doctors with Protect Our Province said there are risks related to government inaction. Those risks, they said, include reduced health-care access for Albertans and increased burnout among health-care professionals.

	Alberta Health Services announced late Wednesday that all scheduled, elective surgeries and outpatient procedures in the Calgary Zone have been postponed for the rest of the week. It said on social media the move was necessary to deploy qualified staff to intensive and critical care units.

	“The situation really has come to a boiling point,” said Schwartz.

	“It's going to be a while before the premier and the chief medical officer of health will be willing to step back and accept that these actions have failed to immediately curb transmission and by that point, we're going to be in dire, dire trouble.”

	“While Phase 5 will remove most restrictions, we can’t ignore the impact of the fourth wave and the impact that the Delta variant is having across the world and the country. That’s why we’ll continue to push messages that encourage vaccination,"" said Houston during Wednesday's news update.

	“Almost 80 per cent of Nova Scotians have gotten their first dose of vaccine, and we’re very close to reaching our target of 75 per cent of the population being fully vaccinated with two doses.

	As of Sept. 15 at 12:01 a.m., masking in indoor places and physical distancing will no longer be mandatory, and there will be no gathering limits.

	While masking will no longer be mandatory, Strang says the province strongly recommends that people voluntarily wear their mask indoors, especially while in close contact with others.

	Health care facilities, businesses and other organizations will continue to set their own policies for masks and visitation.

	Masks will be required in schools until Monday, September 20, to allow students, staff and teachers time to transition to Phase 5.

	“Make no mistake, required masking will also be one of the first measures brought back if cases rise in a certain area or setting,” said Strang on Wednesday.

	Border measures will remain in place, with self-isolation and testing required for any non fully-vaccinated individuals entering the province from outside Newfoundland and P.E.I.

	PROOF OF VACCINATION POLICY

	“Requiring proof of vaccination to participate in activities that are discretionary or nonessential, means we are able to bring larger groups of people together safely,” said Strang.

	The proof of vaccination requirement does not apply to children 11 years of age and under, and they will be allowed to attend these activities with a fully vaccinated adult.

"Here's a breakdown of COVID-19 hospitalizations, case data from August ","Sept. 8, 2021 5:18 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	Saskatchewan’s Ministry of Health is reinforcing the use of COVID-19 vaccines as the best defense against the virus, citing hospitalization and case data from August.

	The report comes as case numbers continue to rise in Saskatchewan. The government reported 305 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday, bringing the seven-day average to 350 – or 29.1 per 100,000 people. This is the highest seven-day average reported to date.

    Advertisement
    
	Out of the 189 people who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in August, 150 – or 79.4 per cent – were unvaccinated or tested positive within three weeks of receiving their first dose. Fourteen cases, or 7.4 per cent, were partially vaccinated with one dose, and 39 cases, 20.6 per cent, were fully vaccinated.

	Forty-one Saskatchewan residents were treated for COVID-19 in intensive care with 33 – or 80 per cent – unvaccinated or testing positive within three weeks of their first dose. Two cases, 4.9 per cent, were partially vaccinated with one dose and eight cases, 19.5 per cent, were fully vaccinated.

	Of the 4,596 new cases reported last month, 3,840 cases, were unvaccinated or tested positive within three weeks of receiving their first dose. Four hundred and twenty-four cases were partially vaccinated with one dose, 756 cases were fully vaccinated. 

	Twenty-two Saskatchewan residents died of COVID-19 in August. Twelve were unvaccinated.

	CONTRIBUTING FACTORS

	Saskatchewan’s Ministry of Health cited underlying health issues and age as factors that contribute to COVID-19 outcomes.

	Of the fully vaccinated people who got COVID-19 in August, 17.6 per cent (133) had comorbid conditions.

	Fourteen hospitalized cases with a first dose, 42.9 per cent, had existing health conditions and 21.4 per cent were 70 years or older.

	Thirty-nine hospitalized cases with a second dose, 56.4 per cent, had existing health conditions and 69.2 per cent were 70 years and older.

	However, other age groups continue to see significant COVID-19 symptoms. Twenty-three, a quarter of the 94 infectious COVID-19 patients in acute care, were younger than 40.

	CHILD AGE BREAKDOWN OF HOSPITALIZATIONS

	Seventeen per cent of Saskatchewan’s new cases in August were children aged 11 and younger.

	Of the 189 individuals who were hospitalized, 5.3 per cent – or 10 cases – were aged 19 years or younger and 3.2 per cent – or six cases – were under 12 with one patient under 12 admitted to ICU.

	GETTING VACCINATED

	There is no COVID-19 vaccine available for children under 12.

	“Transmissible diseases like COVID-19 are opportunistic: they will spread to and among under- and unvaccinated populations. It's critical that all eligible Saskatchewan residents get vaccinated,” the ministry said in a news release.

	Moderna and Pfizer shots are both Health Canada-approved for use in people over 12. Eleven-year-olds who will turn 12 before Dec. 31, 2021, are also eligible to be vaccinated.

	While the province says two standard vaccine doses provide ""optimal protection"" from COVID-19, the province will begin offering booster shots for eligible populations.

	The eligible groups include residents of long-term care and personal care homes, transplant recipients, people undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

	Letters are in the mail for eligible recipients, who are asked to use the letter as proof of eligibility. Additional populations will become eligible in the coming weeks.

COVID-19 rules: Some restrictions might be lifted once B.C.'s vaccine cards are fully implemented,"Sept. 8, 2021 9:51 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C. may lift some COVID-19 restrictions next month, when the province's proof-of-vaccination program is fully implemented.

	The update came from Dr. Bonnie Henry during an afternoon news conference Tuesday about B.C.'s vaccine card system.

	“I really look forward to seeing a full hockey game sometime in the fall or early next winter,” Henry said.

	The system will begin Sept. 13, at which time visitors to non-essential businesses such as restaurants and movie theatres will need at least one dose to enter. By Oct. 24, they'll need to have both doses, and won't be considered fully vaccinated for seven days after the second shot.

	Until then, the mask mandate and current capacity limits are expected to remain. Depending on the violation, fines of $230, $575 or $2,300 can be handed out for breaking a public health order.

	""These (orders) will supplement what we need to do right now as we're moving forward with the B.C. vaccine card,"" Henry said.

	""What we hope as we move through these next few months with the B.C. vaccine card is once it is only immunized people who are at these discretionary events, these social events, these businesses, we'll be able to remove those capacity limits because we know that we've mitigated the risk of so much transmission.""  

	The B.C. government initially hoped to enter Step 4 of its restart plan on Tuesday, though that has been put on hold due to a spike in COVID-19 cases fuelled by the highly contagious Delta variant. 

	Step 4 is the final stage in the province's COVID-19 recovery plan. Personal gatherings, organized gatherings and workplaces would all ""return to normal"" in that phase. Instead of COVID-19 safety plans, businesses, exercise facilities and sports could operate with communicable disease prevention guidance.

	Social contact would be back to normal and mask wearing would be a personal choice, but people would still be asked to stay home when sick and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms develop.

	B.C.’s independent COVID-19 Modelling Group, made up of academics and scientists from a number of post-secondary institutions in the province, would like to see the province take a cautious approach to any easing of restrictions.

	""This is not the time for us, vaccinated or not, to take many risks because we're really trying to protect our community and get the transmissions down to a place that's more manageable,” said Dr. Sarah Otto, the Canada Research Chair in Theoretical and Experimental Evolution.

	Henry said officials are looking at balancing restrictions to get through the fall with the minimum number of disruptions.

	""We can mitigate this risk a lot by having people immunized,"" she said. ""I am hopeful that we will transition over the next few months and by Oct. 24, if we get enough people to step up and get protected … that we'll be able to increase the numbers of people so that we will be somewhere near what we had envisioned in Step 4 of the restart.""

	The original criteria set out by the government for entering Step 4 of the restart plan included getting 70 per cent of the adult population vaccinated with at least one dose, as well as keeping case counts and hospitalization numbers low.

	Health Minister Adrian Dix noted weeks ago the province easily passed the first target earlier this summer, but said the Delta variant threw a wrench into B.C.'s progress on the other two fronts.

B.C. doctors pressured to reduce virtual appointments,"Sept. 8, 2021 9:51 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Family physicians, specialists and surgeons in British Columbia have received a stern letter pressuring them to resume in-person appointments as provincial officials hint they may reassess how they compensate doctors for virtual visits.

	In a joint statement sent to doctors on Friday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, assistant deputy health minister Ted Patterson and College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C registrar and CEO Heidi Oetter urged doctors to resume seeing patients in person rather than virtually, claiming telehealth may lead to pressures on other parts of the healthcare system.

    Advertisement
    
	“Potential drawbacks of providing only virtual care could result in unnecessary emergency room visits when patients are unable to access necessary face-to-face visits, specialist referrals that lack sufficient or pertinent clinical information for accurate triaging and care, and lack of access to important preventive and screening health services,” wrote the signatories. “With appropriate measures in place, we expect all practitioners to resume routine in-person visits based on clinical needs and patient preferences.”  COVID-19 in B.C.: 1st case update of the week includes 3 days of dataFull coverage at CTVNews.ca/CoronavirusIs B.C. flooding affecting the province's COVID-19 numbers? Not yet, Health Ministry saysTracking every case of COVID-19 in CanadaFirst cases of Delta sublineage AY.4.2 confirmed in British ColumbiaCoronavirus vaccine tracker: How many people in Canada have received shots?COVID-19 vaccines for younger kids will likely arrive in B.C. before the holidays, province's top doctor saysGet The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inboxB.C. family plans to cross U.S. border to get COVID-19 vaccine for 8-year-old child'Like playing COVID test roulette': B.C. couple on free PCR testing in the U.S.

	The bolded passage was emphasized by the letter writers, who end the document with a hint they may decide to reduce or eliminate the ability for doctors to bill the medical system for virtual appointments.

	“You may recall that a series of adjustments to the payment schedule were approved by the Medical Services Commission on the basis that they were temporary and could be cancelled on the advice of the provincial health officer,” reads the second page of the document. “The ministry is actively reviewing the current temporary fee codes and considering the appropriate path forward for virtual care compensation.”

	The Doctors of B.C. points out most doctors and surgeons have long-since resumed seeing patients in person, in addition to continuing virtual appointments, and believes the letter was targeting certain doctors.

	“We’ve become aware of a small number of physicians who’ve only been seeing people virtually and have not provided any in-person care over the course of the pandemic and this has raised concerns from patients as well as other doctors,” said organization president Dr. Matthew Chow. “I want to emphasize that virtual care is here to stay, we’ve seen how important it is in the past 18 months and how it saved the medical system from collapse in the first wave.”

	CHANGES IN PHYSICIAN RISK THROUGHOUT PANDEMIC

	Chow says when doctors were ordered to avoid seeing patients face-to-face in March of 2020 it made sense for the protection of patients and practitioners, but now with effective vaccines (and 97 per cent of doctors vaccinated) and a better understanding of protective measures against COVID-19, doctors have an obligation to resume in-person appointments where appropriate.

	CTV News has heard directly from a number of frontline doctors who’ve raised a number of issues and concerns stemming from the letter; several spoke on condition of anonymity only. Most emphasized how vital virtual care has been for elderly patients, those with disabilities, and others living far from medical services who’ve been able to access care much easier than before -- and don't want to lose the ability to provide that kind of healthcare support. Others pointed out there’s been growing resentment among doctors who’ve continued the more difficult and riskier work of face-to-face care, while some of their peers have opted to deal with patients only at a distance.

	""The pandemic has exposed a lot of the inequities in the system and it's really accelerated the adoption we've had of providing better ways of reaching out patients and sometimes that's in the office, sometimes that's by phone and sometimes that's by video,"" said Vancouver physician, Dr. Eric Cadesky. “We always want to provide the right care at the right time at the right place.”

	His comments echoed those of Dr. Manya Sadouski, a family doctor on Salt Spring Island, who urged the province and college to have faith doctors would choose the appropriate method of assessing and treating their patients.

	“It was quite a coercive tone – ‘though shalt return to routine in-person care’ – and lacked some of the subtlety that I was hoping for and so the letter landed to me as if those telehealth appointments are no longer appropriate and the comment about defunding them left me a lot of concerns,” she said. “There needs to be an element of trust in our professionalism and our good faith towards our patients.”

	THE FUTURE OF TELEHEALTH IN B.C. 

	“Telehealth is here to stay, the key is to have the right balance between in person face-to-face care and virtual care and that is something we’re exploring,” said Chow, insisting he doesn’t see a sudden removal of funding for virtual care, which has been compensated at the same rate as in-person visits since last spring.

	Telehealth, whether via phone or video chat have proven extremely popular with patients, many of whom have responded to news of the letter with pleas to continue providing alternatives to in-person visits.

	""For people with chronic illness there are often multiple specialists involved and many appointments are for routine things like referrals, prescription refills, forms, even things like special authority renewals for certain medications -- It can feel like a full-time job frankly,"" pointed out disabled writer and policy analyst, Gabrielle Peters.

	""Virtual appointments fill a gap and address some of the accessibility barriers in healthcare.""

	While it’s likely that virtual health care will continue in some form into the future, the memo was clear that the provincial government and college will have little tolerance for doctors who keep their doors closed to patients as the province hints it’s operating under the idea we are now in the endemic phase of the virus.

	“We are now at a different stage in the COVID-19 pandemic in BC,” reads the memo. “COVID-19 is now a vaccine preventable virus that we will be living with into the future.”

	But Sadouski doesn’t believe that’s the case yet and pointed out each doctor needs to assess their own risk in an indoor work environment where no one is denied care based on vaccination status or any other factors; she emphasized all doctors she knows have been seeing patients in person and virtually throughout the pandemic.

	Right now, 71.6 percent of Nova Scotians are double-dosed.

	""It is absolutely, 100 per cent doable,"" said Tracey Barbrick, the deputy minister in charge of the vaccine rollout in Nova Scotia.

	With just eight days to go, the push to get to 75 per cent continues.

	""We are going to be working hard to reach 75 per cent by Sept. 15,"" said Barbrick. ""Right now, based on what we've got booked and scheduled, we'll be 73.8 per cent fully vaccinated so that means we need close to another 15,000 people to either walk in and get a dose of vaccine or make an appointment before the 15th and get a vaccine.""

	""I think most Albertans watched in trepidation over the last several weeks as patient numbers in hospitals, particularly ICUs, began to climb and vaccination rates stalled,"" the letter read in part.

	""Increased anxiety from the public regarding the load on the healthcare system triggered discussions on mandatory vaccination, masks and vaccine passports. These contentious issues have created division in our community.""

	New rules imposed by the province call for masks to be worn in all indoor public settings and alcohol sales to end at 10 p.m. The province is also now offering $100 to Albertans who receive their first or second dose of vaccine until Oct. 14.

	Guthrie says he is vaccinated and believes vaccines are an effective way of protecting Albertans, but he also supports the right of an individual to choose.

	""Last Friday, the Government of Alberta announced restrictions adopting a disparaging and accusatory tone toward unvaccinated individuals,"" the letter read.

	""People refusing COVID-19 shots were painted as culpable for creating challenges to the healthcare system. This type of communication from our leader feeds a narrative of anger and division which is unproductive in an already turbulent time. The $100 vaccine incentive has also created animosity within the constituency and I am not in favour of the negative tone adopted by leadership.""

	Guthrie also accused the province of shifting its position on vaccine passports, which Kenney has said several times would not be used in Alberta.

	""During last week's announcement it was also revealed to me that the province will be introducing a QR code for Albertans to use as proof of vaccination for organizations choosing to introduce a so-called 'vaccine passport,'"" he wrote.

	""Such a move suggests that the government's position on this practise is shifting. Various public opinions exist on the use of vaccine passports, but I am not convinced it is a good practise for domestic use as it not only limits access to services and isolates individuals, it also provides a false sense of security for those who are vaccinated.""

	She called for reliable data on exposure and case numbers in schools to be publicly available on the B.C. Centre for Disease Control website, the same as how case counts in all health regions are reported.

	The absence of reliable data will only lead others to try and compile their own information, Mooring said.

	Kathy Marliss, who created an online “COVID tracker” page last year and still runs it based on exposure and case information submitted by teachers, parents and administrators, said she'd love to be “out of business” if the government posted the necessary data to keep everyone informed.

	She said parents were anxious last year because information in the notices was so vague, creating concerns that outbreaks at schools weren't being declared.

	“That struck me as problematic because I have a high-risk household and a daughter who would be anxious,” Marliss said about her Grade 11 student.

	“I felt like if they're not going to provide the information then we're going to find another way to do that,” she said, noting parents are already concerned at the start of the school year given rising case counts.

	Henry recently presented modelling data showing new COVID-19 cases could exceed 1,000 a day by the end of the month and that high vaccination rates in the community would help protect students.

	Sabrina Bharaj, whose children are in kindergarten, Grade 5 and Grade 7, said she's worried about the high number of unvaccinated people based on thousands of anti-vaccination protesters who showed up outside Vancouver General Hospital and other health-care facilities around the province last week.

	“It's terrifying,” she said, adding the lack of exposure notices and lack of a mask mandate for kindergarten-to-Grade 3 students don't help.

	Bharaj said her kids learned remotely at home last year because her mother is immunocompromised and stayed with the family after having surgery, but her older children in particular are nervous about returning to class because of rising COVID-19 cases.

	Some students are having to navigate friendships based on whether their peers' families have been vaccinated, and that's adding more discomfort before the return to school on Tuesday, Bharaj said.

	“My eldest is double dosed,” she said of her daughter. “That eases her nerves a little bit knowing that she has that layer of protection. But she's still quite nervous because she knows that there are kids in her class that didn't get the vaccine and whose parents are anti-vaxxers.”

	This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 6, 2021.

     VANCOUVER - 
     
    
	British Columbians wondering about the state of the pandemic on the day before kids head back to class will have to wait until Tuesday for an update.

	No new COVID-19 data is expected from provincial health officials on Labour Day, as is common on long weekends.

    Advertisement
    
	This means the number of cases announced Tuesday will be that much higher. The update will include cases recorded in four 24-hour periods.

	Even though officials have noted dips in the number of people who get tested over long weekends, the latest modelling data suggests case numbers could approach record levels by the end of the month.

	As of Friday's update, when another 671 people had been diagnosed with the disease, a total of 168,325 infections had been confirmed in B.C.

	Of those, 5,872 were considered active. And the number of hospitalizations, particularly of patients requiring treatment in intensive care units, is also higher than earlier in the summer.

	On Friday there were 215 people hospitalized due to the novel coronavirus, more than half of whom were in ICU.

	The ratio of ICU patients is notable at this stage in the pandemic.

	On June 6 there were 224 patients in hospital, but only 59 in intensive care. A recent U.K. study suggests the Delta variant – now the dominant strain in Canada – could be playing a role in this.

	Having both doses of the vaccine does not mean a person will not get COVID-19. ImmunizeBC says no vaccine is 100 per cent effective.

	However, according to health officials, the overall number of cases is lower among vaccinated people, as is the severity (including illness, hospitalization and death).

	Nearly 85 per cent of eligible adults in B.C. have received at least one shot, and 77.1 per cent have had both. Some may be told to get a third, a rollout the province's top doctor, Bonnie Henry, estimated to begin in October.

	VACCINE PASSPORT ON SEPT. 13

	Soon, the activities of those who've opted not to get the shots will be limited in the province, though details have not yet been provided.

	So-called ""passports"" will be required for a person to take part in non-essential activities such as dining out or going to the movies.

	It's unclear what form this documentation will take, but a resident or visitor will have to have evidence, through their passport, of having at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

	Details will likely be released this week, ahead of the Sept. 13 launch. The passports will be phased in, the province has said.

	BACK TO SCHOOL

	The new school year will look a little different to some children, but not all.

	This time around, students who are eligible are urged to get vaccinated, and those in grades 4 to 12 will have to wear masks at their desks, in hallways and in other indoor spaces.

	There are some exceptions, including when eating or drinking, playing a wind instrument or taking part in high-intensity exercise. 

	Younger kids, in kindergarten to Grade 3, are encouraged to wear a mask indoors and on the school bus, but they don't have to.

	Physical distancing is no longer required, though schools may take measures to prevent crowding if they choose to.

	Children or teens will be required to do a daily health check and stay home if they're sick.

	In the event of an exposure, public health officials will notify parents or caregivers if their child was determined to be a close contact.

	Online and homeschooling are still options.

	Guidelines published late last week show the plan for the new semester at the post-secondary level. 

	Proof of vaccination is not required to attend classes in person, but masks are mandatory in all public indoor areas.

	However, individual institutions can implement their own policies including a proof-of-vaccine system or mandatory testing, so students should check with their own school before returning.

Vancouver mask company speaks out after flood of hateful messages,"Sept. 4, 2021 10:02 a.m. CST","

	Crown Mutual Medical Group has been manufacturing medical masks since the beginning of the pandemic. The former marketing company is one of many businesses that was forced to pivot when COVID-19 began plaguing the country.

	The company tells CTV News Vancouver it recently posted an advertising video on Facebook, echoing the provincial government’s mask mandate and asking people to please get vaccinated to prevent the spread of COVID-19..

    Advertisement
    
	“The intensity of the feedback kept growing,” said Sean McKay, the company’s marketing director. “The next thing we knew, we had over 130 comments on our Facebook page, each of them angrier than the next.”  COVID-19 in B.C.: 1st case update of the week includes 3 days of dataFull coverage at CTVNews.ca/CoronavirusIs B.C. flooding affecting the province's COVID-19 numbers?

	From accusing the company to being part of a conspiracy theory to peddling propaganda, the comments became too overwhelming and forced the company to pull the plug on the ad.

	“We know people are tired of COVID,” McKay said. “We’re definitely tired of COVID too. We make masks, but I think people need to look a little further under the surface here because we’re here to help. We’re here to make medical masks to keep people safe.”

	Many businesses have been targeted throughout the pandemic for making personal protective equipment like masks. Complaints escalated this summer, when health officials lifted the mask mandate in B.C. and left it up to businesses to decide whether to require them.

	With less than two weeks to go until B.C.’s vaccine passport system rolls out, some fear the anger will only get worse.

	“I think everyone has a right to doubt, ask questions and push back, but we have to remember that this is a unique situation that’s never happened before, but we’re all in it,” McKay said. “We’re all subject. And we should all want to help each other.”

A record-breaking 441 flights were added to B.C.'s COVID-19 exposures list in August,"Sept. 5, 2021 10:03 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
     A record number of flights with COVID-19 cases on board passed through B.C. airports in the month of August, according to data from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.  As of Thursday, the centre had published 441 exposure notices for flights that took off from or landed at B.C. airports last month, with more August flights likely to be added in the coming days as the BCCDC learns of more travellers' positive tests. 
    Advertisement
     The previous record for flight exposure notifications in a month was set in April, when 261 planes with the coronavirus on board passed through B.C. airports.

As it has in the past, the rising number of flight exposures corresponds to rising caseloads in B.C., as the pandemic's Delta-variant-fuelled fourth wave leads to reimposed restrictions and the implementation of vaccine passports in the province.   While the surge in cases - and the surge in flight exposures - has been significant, a Vancouver infectious disease specialist said the volume of COVID-19 exposures at B.C. airports is less of an issue than the precautions taken to ensure safe travel.  ""We currently live in a world of COVID,"" said Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre.  ""It is highly likely that we will live in a world of COVID for the foreseeable future, so these (flight exposures) are occurrences that will happen on an ongoing basis. They will not, not happen.""  Knowing this, the most important precautions to take are requiring that all air travellers be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and requiring that they provide a recent negative test for the disease before boarding their flights, Conway said.  The federal government has required international travellers to provide a negative test before boarding Canada-bound flights since early January, but no such requirement exists for domestic travel.   Similarly, fully vaccinated travellers who are eligible to enter Canada - a group that currently includes people travelling for essential reasons, as well as vaccinated Americans travelling for recreation - are exempt from the federal government's 14-day quarantine requirement.   The federal government has said it plans to require domestic air travellers to show proof of vaccination before boarding their flights, but those rules have not yet been implemented - and may not ever be, depending on the outcome of the ongoing federal election.   Most of the flights added to the exposures list in August were domestic.    Conway described vaccine and negative test requirements as ""reasonable procedures"" that should be in place alongside mask requirements on all flights.  ""We're not going to wait years until there is no COVID to start flying again,"" he said. ""That's not reasonable. So I think that going forward this is how we construct the new universe. But the premise of all of this for us all to understand is that COVID is not going away.""    As for the at least 441 flights that took off from or landed at B.C. airports in August and had a case of COVID-19 on board, Conway said more information about the total number of flights in the province during the month would be necessary to put the number in context.  Travel has increased as pandemic-related restrictions have loosened, but the most recent data on the number of flights passing through B.C.'s busiest airport - Vancouver - is from June, before the province entered Step 3 of its restart plan.   Without knowing the total number of flights that passed through B.C. airports in August, it's hard to say how significant the increase to 441 public exposure notices in a single month is, Conway said.  ""As long as appropriate public health measures were taken as a reaction to each and every one of these several hundred cases that were reported, then the system did its job,"" he said.  ""But, going forward, we need to do our job probably more efficiently, and my sense is that would lead to a decrease in the number of reported cases, but it won't ever be zero. Not in the foreseeable future.""  For people who have been on a flight that ended up on the BCCDC's exposure list, Conway has some simple advice: Get tested.  And, for those concerned about returning to the skies when the coronavirus is circulating so widely, he reiterated that there's going to be some risk of getting COVID-19 no matter what, at least over the next few years.  ""If individuals are waiting to get on an airplane until it's absolutely, 100 per cent safe, and that's the criteria that they will use, I respect that,"" Conway said. ""But, in making that decision, you are essentially deciding that you will not take an airplane probably for the next year or two.""

	After the announcment, first dose demand shot up to 500 first doses, according to Musyj.

	Musyj says they're focusing their attention now on people who need one final nudge to get a shot.

	""There is a segment of the population, just like there is a segment of our workforce, that that's what they just need. I have to do this because I have to keep my job. I have to do this because I wanna go to a restaurant. Because I wanna go to a gym. Because I wanna go to a movie theatre."" says Musyj.

	Officials announced last week that, beginning on Sept. 13, B.C. residents will be required to show proof that they have received at least a first dose of vaccine to dine at restaurants, attend ticketed sporting events, go to the movies or do a variety of other discretionary activities.

	By Oct. 24, residents will be required to show proof that they are fully vaccinated before entering such venues and events.

	Lear said during lockdowns earlier in the pandemic, people living alone or in shared housing with roommates depended on going out to meet friends and family, often in restaurants.

	""That will have some social implications for those individuals,"" Lear said. ""There are obviously other opportunities that they can connect with people, but if you're used to going to the gym, being social there, or at a restaurant, that's definitely not going to be available.""

	Lear said there could also be a strain on relationships as a result.

	""We've already heard about tension in families and among friends who are and aren't vaccinated … so this might actually create a bigger wedge in those tensions and harm relationships,"" he said.

	""That would be the definite big downside for people who are unvaccinated if it creates social isolation.""

	The implications for those who are unvaccinated could reach beyond relationships, Lear said, especially if getting two shots is a requirement to work.

	""If it comes to the point where an individual has to be present at a workplace and there's a vaccine requirement, that could have some implications for that individual financially,"" Lear said.

	""Of course if an unvaccinated person, or anybody, gets COVID, depending on their job and their medical benefits, they would have to be at home and not be able to work. We know people who are unvaccinated are more likely to get infected and have more severe symptoms.""

	Lear recommended anyone who is hesitant to get the vaccine speak to a trusted health-care professional to discuss their concerns and answer their questions.

	""Having that discussion can help to bring that information forward and address concerns,"" he said.

	""Of the people who are unvaccinated, not all of them are really vaccine-resistant, they just might have questions that need to be answered.""

	Starting Saturday, masks will be mandatory across the province in all indoor public and work spaces. Schools will continue to set their own policies.

The federal election? Pundits weigh in  

	And, Alberta will pay unvaccinated residents $100 to get the COVID-19 shot.

	The announcement on Friday came with a plea from Premier Jason Kenney for the 30 per cent of eligible unvaccinated Albertans to ""do the right thing."" Their choice to not get vaccinated, he said, was jeopardizing the health care system, whose ICU capacity was at 95 per cent province wide that morning.

	He disagreed the $100 incentive was a bribe or reward to people who had so far ignored medical and scientific advice.

	""I wish we didn't have to do this, but this is not a time for moral judgements. This is a time to get people vaccinated,"" he said.

	""I'm much more concerned about protecting our hospitals than I am about some abstract message that this sends.""

	He also believes the financial incentive will reduce barriers for lower-income residents.

	PANDEMIC OF THE UNVACCINATED

	Kenney characterized the spread of the Delta variant in the unvaccinated population as ""ripping its way through this group at an aggressive rate.""

	According to provincial data, since Alberta fully reopened July 1, unvaccinated adults between the ages of 20 and 59 have had a 50-to-60-times higher risk of hospitalization. More than 80 per cent of all COVID-19 hospitalizations since July 1 have been unvaccinated people. Of the current 114 ICU patients, 91 per cent are unvaccinated.

	Health Minister Tyler Shandro said he and his colleagues ""honestly thought"" more of the public would be vaccinated by September when they lifted restrictions in July. That decision, he said, was based off data from the United Kingdom which suggested the Delta variant caused a spike in cases but didn't raise severe outcomes the same way.

	The modelling from which the province crafted its reopening plan that launched on July 1 was released Friday.

	It shows Alberta is approaching the model's ""high scenario"" which would see more than 1,700 cases a day within the next two weeks.

	It also indicates the number of patients in hospital is also rising quicker than anticipated, with as many as 300 patients in ICU and nearly 700 non-ICU hospitalizations listed as a ""high scenario"" that could play out over the next three weeks.

	The premier also warned Friday that the modelling's projected late-September peak could be ""longer and later.""

	But the officials expect Friday's measures to be enough to keep COVID-19 from overrunning the hospital system.

	""This wave, we anticipate, will be different from previous waves as it is a smaller group of the population who is susceptible,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said.

	She called a list of measures she brought to cabinet for consideration, including those announced Friday, a ""reasonable balance"" of the impacts of COVID-19 and public health orders.

	'FOR THE LOVE OF GOD'

	All officials made another attempt to convince vaccine-hesitant residents of the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 shot.

	""If you just haven't gotten around to if, for the love of God, please get vaccinated now,"" Kenney begged.

	The mask and alcohol rules are the only hard lines being set by the Alberta government.

	It is also recommending, where possible, employers do not plan to bring employees back to the office.

	And officials encouraged unvaccinated people to limit their social visits to close contacts: no more than two families totalling 10 people. Vaccinated Albertans do not need to do the same.

	Non-urgent surgeries are being postponed in all five health regions, too.

	Alberta will not mandate vaccines at the public level, Kenney reiterated.

	He remarked earlier in the press conference: ""The reality is that we as a government don't get to choose how the virus behaves or how many people choose to protect themselves against it. We just have to find a way of limiting the damage that it causes, especially to our health care system.""

	Hinshaw declined to say whether or not she supported a vaccine passport, telling media instead she believed policy decisions should be made officials elected by a population.

	""It's clear that in other populations when a requirements have been introduced that uptake has increased, but at the same time that is not without some impact. So again, those kinds of decisions need to be made taking into account local context as well as what's been seen in other jurisdictions.""

	The personal incentive program will be available to all Albertans who receive their first or second shot between Sept. 3 and Oct. 14 in the form of one pre-filled debit card. Online registration will open Sept. 13.

"Unvaccinated hospital staff in Windsor-Essex, Ont. could face unpaid leave, termination","Sept. 4, 2021 7:46 a.m. CST","
     
     Windsor, Ont. - 
     
    
	A Windsor-Essex, Ont. hospital network is planning to implement a mandatory vaccination policy that could see unvaccinated staff members placed on unpaid leave or let go.

	All employees, staff, students and volunteers who work at any of the five Erie St. Clair Hospitals (Windsor Regional Hospital, Hôtel Dieu Grace Healthcare, Bluewater Health, Chatham Kent Health Alliance and Erie Shores HealthCare) are expected to be fully vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine.

       Ontario premier to meet with cabinet to discuss mandatory vaccinations for health-care, education workers: sourcesGroup of 14 Ontario hospitals adopts mandatory vaccine policy in which unvaccinated staff could face termination

	A joint letter issued by hospital health-care leaders states:

	""After reviewing, examining and discussing our local condition…the former Erie-St. Clair LHIN have collectively agreed to implement a progressive plan to ensure that all employees, credentialed staff and volunteers (not including those with an accommodation for medical exemption or under the Ontario Human Rights Code to full vaccination), will be subject to progressive policies beyond mandatory education and testing, leading to unpaid leave and/or termination for cause.'

	Mandatory vaccination for new staff will also be implemented by all hospitals to support this effort.

	“It’s a very difficult decision to make and all of the hospitals struggled with this decision,” said President and CEO of Windsor Regional Hospital, David Musyj. “Time is of the essence, we can’t play around with this any longer. We’ve got to get staff vaccinated to 100 per cent.”

	Musyj reports 94 per cent of their staff are fully vaccinated.

	Chatham-Kent Health Alliance says 87 per cent or staff have declared their vaccination status. Of those, 86 per cent are fully vaccinated with roughly 50 people of those single dosed.

	Officials at Bluewater Health tell CTV News they don’t have exact vaccination data from employees at this point but say 133 staff members have opted-in for the current 'testing' program out of a staff of 1,800 people.

	Erie Shores says they are “still in the process of gathering vaccine declarations from our staff.”

	A total of 86 per cent of staff members at Hotel Dieu Grace Healthcare are vaccinated. Officials add there are around 150 employees who have either not disclosed their vaccination status or are not vaccinated.

	“We need to do everything possible to continue to safeguard our patients, families, communities and those who provide their care. We are grateful to all those who have already been vaccinated. It is our best defense against this virus and the best effort to lessen the impact of a fourth wave,"" the statement goes on to say.

	When the policy will come into place remains to be confirmed. However, each hospital is expected to announce a deadline for all impacted employees.

	“I do believe this is the right thing to do to protect all of us. Our patients and our families deserve the best protection that we can provide and I believe our community is going to take comfort in knowing that their care teams have been vaccinated,” said Lori Marshall, President and CEO of CKHA.

eHealth Sask. facing pressure from growing proof of vaccination demand,"Sept. 3, 2021 9:12 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	eHealth Saskatchewan said it is facing its highest demand for its MySaskHealthRecord service since the start of the pandemic.

	Vice President of Programs and Technology Davin Church said eHealth ""sincerely apologizes"" for the delays people have experienced in recent days while trying to sign up for the service that offers online access to medical records, including COVID-19 test results and proof of vaccination.

    Advertisement
    
	""Recent announcements from organizations and facilities requiring proof of vaccination has created more demand for proof of vaccine certificates,"" Church said. ""As a result eHealth has had increased call volumes and people have been experiencing longer than normal wait times.""

	Barry Shefernack and his wife are two of those affected. They have been trying to access the website in order to get their COVID-19 test results.

	Shefernack called the process frustrating.

	“This is our what, third day of getting messages saying basically due to high demand, all our lines are busy, please call back,"" Shefernack said.

	Church said the growing need for proof of vaccination at events, post-secondary institutions and some workplaces is driving its highest volume of calls since the start of the pandemic.

	One issue many are facing is surrounding the need to get a pin by phone to complete the sign up process.

	""What that does is it's an additional verification process to ensure that the individual that's registering for access to their health records is in fact that individual,"" Church said. ""It really is just an enhanced security measure whereby by calling in there's some additional questions that are asked that aren't part of the original registration process.""

	eHealth has expanded its phone line to operate on the weekend to help address the demand.

	""Certainly the numbers in call volumes and accesses to MySaskHealthRecord are higher than we had seen at any point previously during the pandemic,"" Church said. ""We’re continuing to work on building our capacity, we are extending our internal capacity to answer those phone lines so in the next few days we should see a significant decline in that or that’s our hope.""

	Shefernack said the changes should have been implemented in advance instead of when the system became strained.

	""They should clearly have known that thousands of people are going to need this information,"" Shefernack said.

	In the month of August, around 60,000 people accessed their COVID-19 proof of vaccination on MySaskHealthRecord and eHealth is averaging more than 2,500 calls a day.

	Health officials said it’s up to business owners themselves to decide whether or not to ask staff to provide proof of vaccination before coming to work.

	""It's up to the businesses. I mean, it's probably a good idea if you're making the customers do it, the staff should also be doing it too,"" said Kelly Adlys, manager of Heuther Hotel in Waterloo. ""It's good for the business, right? You don't want anyone to be sick or to go home.""

	""I'm personally fully vaccinated, and I have no problem saying (that), but I also do think that people have a choice,"" said server Christina Eleftheriou.

	Indoor dining is included in the list of businesses where customers will need to show proof of vaccination. Restaurants are quickly preparing for the mandate, and management will be able to decide if staff should be vaccinated while on the job.

	“That’s up to the business,” said James Rilett with Restaurants Canada. “The government has made the decision not to require that. I think, for the most part, restaurants are asking staff to be vaccinated. We are recommending that they look at it and they establish what policies work. We are not recommending any specific policies.”

	At King Street Trio Uptown in Waterloo, owner Brian Plouff said indoor dining is the only option for his customers and he wants to make the experience as safe as possible.

	""We have taken a position here that all of the staff are vaccinated and we took that decision before we reopened so I think that having everyone vaccinated in an indoor environment is probably the best situation right now given the cases starting to go up,"" he said.

	On Wednesday, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Associate Medical Officer of Health Dr. Matthew Tenenbaum sent an open letter to businesses, encouraging them to implement vaccine policies for their staff. Dr. Tenenbaum said the health unit has noticed an uptick in people getting vaccinated to satisfy conditions of employment. He stopped short of saying vaccines should be mandatory in all workplaces.

	Adlys with the Huether Hotel said while he doesn't have an official policy in place, all of his staff are fully vaccinated.

	""If a person doesn't have the vaccine or doesn't wear a mask, we can't serve you. We have to worry about our staff and if our staff get hurt or sick, we have to close down for 14 days,"" he said. ""We don't need that to happen.""

	Local leaders in Winkler, Man. are trying to find ways to bridge a growing divide over mandatory vaccinations and other pandemic measures.

	It’s been no secret many people in and around the southern Manitoba community have been critical of the COVID-19 response.

    Advertisement
    
	Over the past two days, large rallies have been held in the community, including one where speakers called for Winkler to become a so-called sanctuary city where people can live in freedom no matter their vaccination status.

	Meantime, on Winkler’s Main Street, you’ll find people with mixed views on vaccine mandates.

	Marie Skeavington said she wasn’t ready to get immunized against COVID-19 due to concerns over how fast vaccines were developed but now says she will because it’s a requirement of her job.

	“I probably will,” Skeavington said. “Well, I have to, actually because if I’m going to run a daycare, well then I have to.”

	In videos posted to YouTube of rallies Sunday and Monday near Winkler, speakers voiced opposition to mandates and other pandemic measures.

	One man suggested Winkler become a so-called sanctuary city where people can live in freedom whether they choose to get the vaccine or not.

	“We need to put a hedge of protection around this community because the wolves are upon us,” the man said.

	Henry Siemens, the city’s deputy mayor, said council is aware of the idea but hasn’t received any official proposals. However, he didn’t rule anything out.

	“In broad strokes, a sanctuary city, I wouldn’t have ever seen it used in this manner before,” Siemens said, noting he’s fully vaccinated. “When we get that we’ll have all of council review and determine the best way forward.”

	He’s concerned some people feel like they’re not being heard. In addition to serving on city council, he’s also a business owner and is concerned about the impact the divide over vaccinations is having on the community’s reputation.

	“We have an arrow pointed at us by media, by others — some of which is self-induced, certainly because people have been out there both pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine,” Siemens said.

	It’s caused a rift in the community the pastors at Emmanuel Mennonite Church are grappling with.

	“We could have a rally going out every highway out of Winkler and we could have them all going out at the same time,” said Karen Schellenberg, an interim pastor at the church. “And all of them would have a different point of view on this issue: vaccinations, masks, mandates all those sorts of things.”

	Schellenberg and Pastor Corey Hildebrand are not asking people in their congregation whether they’re vaccinated but feel the majority are. They’re urging people to practise compassion.

	“There is a polarization between us, there is a fracture,” said Hildebrand. “But I think in the middle of it we have to remember what the problem is, that it’s the pandemic that we’re battling here and not each other.”

	Some worry lives are on the line. With experts predicting a Delta driven fourth wave will hit Manitoba, Winkler-based physician Dr. Don Klassen is concerned low vaccine rates may mean a disproportionate number of people from the area will end up in hospital or intensive care.

	“Nobody’s going to go around, giving them the jab in a sneaky or secret fashion but I’ve said to people this is a tool we have,” Klassen said.

	Klassen is stressing to people here that tool — the vaccines — works. He pointed to long-term care as one area where it’s reduced severe outcomes from COVID-19.

	Siemens said in many cases people need more information to make informed decisions. He said face-to-face conversations seem to be helping.

Manitoba public health working to improve early childhood immunization accessibility,"Sept. 1, 2021 1:08 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	During the pandemic, public health resources have been stretched thin and in rural areas, and accessibility to routine early childhood immunization has not been consistent across the province.

	Dr. Joss Reimer, the medical lead for the province’s COVID-19 vaccination implementation task force also said, what is consistent is how necessary these shots are for children and public health is working to improve accessibility.

    Advertisement
    
	Dr. Reimer said in Winnipeg many families can access these shots for diseases like pertussis through a community paediatrician, but in rural areas, families typically need to visit their local public health office. Over the last 18 months, staff at those locations have been strained with things like case and contact tracing and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

       Unintended consequence of COVID-19: Fewer parents taking kids to get immunized

	""It is certainly challenging for them to also provide the usual services for the infant and early childhood vaccines,"" she said.

	Dr. Reimer said each public health office in Manitoba would make its own decision on when to make routine vaccinations available, but more broadly, it is being worked on.

	New mom Josee Voth, who lives near Altona, said she has fought tooth and nail to find available appointments to get her daughter’s routine immunizations booked.

	“It seems like it’s off and on,” Voth told CTV News. “And when my daughter was due for her 4 month (shots), she was actually overdue, she was 6 months and still hadn’t received her 4-month shots.”

	This was when Voth started contacting public health and her MLA because it just wasn’t getting anywhere.

	Voth said she was told by her public health office that they had been ordered not to administer routine vaccines indefinitely so they didn’t even know when they could administer again. She said she was advised to try her own doctor, but Voth said her doctor did not do those types of childhood shots and was told by staff at that clinic to go to the public health office.

	“It just seemed like I was being run around in circles,” she said.

	Voth ended up finding a clinic in Winkler to get her daughter’s four-month shots and she was able to get the six-month shots in Altona.

	Now, her daughter’s one-year shots are coming up and she’s gone ahead and booked that appointment in another town.

	“I am a new mom, this is my first child, so I am probably a little over the top with most things, like on the cautious end of things,” Voth said. “But for someone who has decided to immunize my child, I live in a very low vaccinated area already, so for me, it was important because I do believe in the science and I do think it’s one piece of the puzzle to protect my child and so it was important for me.”

	Voth also said it is public health that emphasizes children stay on schedule for these shots, and wonders why this has been pushed to the wayside.

	“I guess I don’t understand why it was so important in the past and now all of a sudden it’s not important.”

	She is also concerned that other rural Manitoba families who don’t have the means or time to travel for these shots, may just forego them altogether.

	 

	“I do believe this is one reason why our routine vaccination rates have declined because of the lack of access in rural communities like mine.”

	Voth said she does understand the situation public health is in with the pandemic, but she would like rural public health offices to resume administering these routine childhood shots to some capacity and to let community members know about availability.

	“If public health thinks this is important, they should be doing something about it, and maybe they are, but it has not been brought to my attention.”

	A provincial spokesperson told CTV News that there has been a decline in routine vaccination coverage for early childhood shots like rotavirus, pertussis, and the first dose of the MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella).

	The data pulled in May of 2021 compared the birth cohort from March 1, 2019 – March 31, 2020 (pre-COVID) and the birth cohort from April 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021 (During COVID).

	The coverage rates in the birth cohort during COVID demonstrated a straight decrease of 20 per cent for second dose pertussis and 30 per cent for third dose pertussis.

	There was a 15 per cent decrease for second dose rotavirus and 23% for third dose rotavirus.

	For the MMRV vaccine, dose one coverage rates were 16 per cent lower during the COVID-19 period compared to pre-COVID.

"Potential mask, COVID-19 vaccine mandates coming to Prince Albert city facilities","Sept. 1, 2021 12:53 a.m. CST","
     
     PRINCE ALBERT - 
     
    
	Prince Albert City Council is set to discuss a COVID-19 vaccine and masking mandate for people using city facilities.

	According to Mayor Greg Dionne, council will debate the topic at its next meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 7.

    Advertisement
    
	It comes after Saskatoon passed a similar motion on Monday, along with the City of Regina implementing mandates in city facilities.
        RELATED STORIES
       Active COVID-19 cases have increased more than 250% in north Sask. Saskatoon city council votes to require masks at civic facilities, on buses 

	“Saskatoon’s had quite a few outbreaks, so I’m glad to see they’re the first to act – but we may follow shortly,” said Dionne.

	“It’s all about safety. It’s not about power and inflicting pain on people. It’s about keeping the majority of the population safe, and that’s who we work for, we work for the majority of the population, not the minority. And the majority of the population are getting vaccinated and I want to thank them for that.”

	Dionne commended the Saskatchewan Roughriders, who announced Monday that proof of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine or a negative test will be required to attend home games.

	“It is going to be a little more costly, but the other thing is you cannot put a price on somebody’s life,” he said.

	Should council vote in favour of the mandates, masks and vaccines would be required in facilities such as City Hall, the Alfred Jenkins Fieldhouse, the E.A. Rawlinson Centre and the Art Hauser Centre.

	The discussion comes as COVID-19 cases spike across Saskatchewan, but particularly in Prince Albert and the north.

	According to the Government of Saskatchewan, the North Central 2 zone – which consists of just Prince Albert – has 163 active cases.

"Oil prices boost Alberta's bottom line, provincial deficit still nearing $8B","Sept. 1, 2021 9:59 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	Higher-than-anticipated energy prices will help carve out some of the province's deficit — which now sits at $7.8 billion, about $10.5 billion lower than forecast in Budget 2020 — but a resurgence of COVID-19 could derail Alberta's recovery. 

	That's according to the Alberta government's first quarter update, delivered by Finance Minister Travis Toews Tuesday morning. 

    Advertisement
    
	""After a historically challenging year, Alberta’s economy is already witnessing signs of recovery and growth,"" Toews said.

	""While this indicates Alberta’s recovery plan is working, we know there is still more to do to create jobs and restore Alberta’s place as the economic driver of the nation.""

	Alberta's revenue for 2021-22 is now forecast to reach $55 billion, helped mostly by natural resource revenue that is $6.9 billion higher than anticipated in the budget. Income tax revenue is also expected to climb $1.2 billion more than forecast and federal transfers will jump by $1.5 billion. 

	The global price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) soared in the first quarter of the fiscal year before slowing slightly. Still, the province's fiscal outlook is now forecasting WTI to hover around US$65.50 per barrel for the year, $19 higher than what was forecast in Alberta's Budget 2020. 

	Bitumen royalties alone are forecast to net Alberta $7.1 billion in the fiscal year, $5.6 billion higher than the budget. Crude oil and natural gas royalties are on track to bring in $1.2 billion each. 

	According to the provincial government, Alberta added 73,000 jobs since the start of the year and about 90 per cent of the jobs lost due to the pandemic have been recovered.

	COVID COSTS AND FUTURE RISK

	The direct costs of the pandemic will continue to impact the province's fiscal situation through 2021-22, and the momentum created in the first quarter could be thwarted if the virus continues to spread in the province and beyond, according to the report. 

	Alberta is spending $5.4 billion to combat COVID-19 and recover from the economic hardships caused by the pandemic, about $1.5 billion higher than anticipated in the budget. 

	Much of that money is for operating expenses and the costs of vaccine deployment, testing, relaunch grants and jobs programs. 

	Despite the positive energy prices, the pandemic is still very much happening and could cause significant changes to Alberta's fiscal situation. 

	""The rapid spread of the Delta variant could dampen the global recovery and lead to a sharper pullback in commodity prices and demand, including oil,"" Alberta's fiscal report reads.

	""A stronger-than- expected increase in OPEC+ or U.S. production could also weigh on oil prices. At the same time, a resurgence in COVID-19 infections in Alberta could also derail the recovery in the second half of the year.""

	The Simcoe Muskoka health unit logged 50 new COVID-19 cases since Friday and no new virus-related deaths.

	Of the 50 residents who tested positive over the weekend, 37 are unvaccinated, five are partially vaccinated, and eight were fully vaccinated.

	Currently, there are 198 active infections in the region, including eight COVID-19-positive patients in the hospital.

	VACCINATION LATEST

	The health unit reports 72 per cent of Simcoe Muskoka residents have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 62 per cent of those fully vaccinated.

	According to Public Health Ontario, 73 per cent of the population had received at least one shot, with 66 per cent having received both.

	Residents born in 2009 or earlier are eligible for the vaccine.

	The health unit says unvaccinated individuals are eight times more likely to catch COVID-19 and 29 times more likely to be hospitalized with the virus. It adds that unvaccinated residents are 48 times more likely to be ICU patients after contracting the virus than vaccinated residents.

	GUIDANCE FOR BACK TO SCHOOL

	The province removed a runny nose, sore throat and headaches from the list of COVID-19 symptoms that would require a child to stay home from school or daycare.

	Instead, children exhibiting symptoms that are the ""most commonly associated with COVID-19"" should remain home, including fever and chills, cough or barking cough, shortness of breath, losing taste or smell and nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.

	The University of Saskatchewan made the announcement on Aug. 27.

	In April’s federal budget, Ottawa earmarked $59.2 million for VIDO, whose vaccine was began clinical human trials as of February 2021. According to the U of S the lab’s vaccine candidate was administered to 108 volunteers at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax.

	The lab's COVAC-2 candidate is a ""sub-unit"" vaccine that relies on purified viral proteins and would not require the ultra-cold storage of the mRNA-based Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, according to the U of S. It is created using the same technique as vaccines commonly given to prevent diphtheria and whooping cough.

	“I think this is far bigger than one vaccine,” said Malcolm Leggett in a news release. “This is a whole different category on its own. It’s got the potential to be so rewarding. I don’t really think we can visualize what the potential is for something like VIDO.”

	Malcolm is the co-founder of NSC Minerals, a Saskatoon-based provider of salt for de-icing, industrial and agricultural applications, which was started in 1988 and serves Western Canada and the western United States, according to a news release. Marilyn is a former teacher for Saskatoon Public Schools.

	“We greatly appreciate this extraordinary donation from Marilyn and Malcolm,” said Dr. Volker Gerdts, VIDO director and CEO. “Knowing we have this level of support from leaders in our community is critical to our organization and our vision for the future.”

	With support from the Leggetts, other private donors and all levels of government, Canada’s Centre for Pandemic Research will soon be established at VIDO, according to the U of S.

	This expansion to VIDO’s capacity is expected to be completed over the next three years.

Sask. doctors brace for challenging autumn as COVID-19 transmission rises and vaccinations stall,"Aug. 28, 2021 5:03 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	Forty-seven days after all COVID-19 public health measures were lifted in the province, Saskatchewan has found itself in a familiar place.

	COVID-19 case counts have increased dramatically over the past month. On July 26, the seven-day rolling average of new cases was 39. That number hit 172 on Wednesday, a count not seen since mid-May.

	During a presentation to doctors Thursday night, which was hosted by the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA), health officials outlined the current state of COVID-19 in the province.

       258 new COVID-19 cases, 2 deaths reported in Sask. Sask. health minister pushes back against restrictions, mandatory vaccines amid rising COVID-19 casesProof of vaccination or negative test to be required at some Regina concerts, venues

	“We’re really back in high COVID transmission territory,” Dr. Johnmark Opondo, an SHA medical health officer, said during the presentation.

	Dr. Opondo said they are beginning to see challenges with community outbreaks in places they previously hadn’t because of social mixing between vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

	“There’s enough COVID transmission to not only create an increase in cases, but there’s enough momentum to begin causing breakthrough illness in vaccinated people. So it is a pretty serious state of affairs,” he said.

	The province reported 258 new COVID-19 cases on Friday; 32 were in fully vaccinated residents.

	CALLS TO CURB NEW INFECTIONS WITH MORE MEASURES

	Health officials said there are things that can be done to suppress the surge in new cases. According to Dr. Opondo, medical health officers sent a letter to SHA and government leaders on Thursday to advocate for early action to reduce community transmission.

	He said heading into September, vaccines will need to be paired with other interventions. Health officials want to promote indoor masking mandates, the consideration of vaccine passports for non-essential social events and encourage residents to reduce personal and public gathering sizes.

	“Even with two doses of vaccine, we really do need to add in the other layers of protection that we know have worked, even when we didn’t have vaccine available,” said Dr. Opondo.

	The medical health officers’ stance is contrary to the provincial government’s mindset. On Wednesday, Health Minister Paul Merriman told reporters the government will not reinstate public health measures or enforce vaccine requirements, despite signs the province is entering a fourth wave.

	He said the government believes vaccines are the way through the swell in news cases and hospitalizations, and the province wouldn’t reissue a mask mandate as B.C. and Manitoba have.

	“Public health measures that other provinces are choosing to do, that’s their prerogative. But we feel right now that the vaccine is the best path,” said Merriman.

	VACCINATIONS PLATEAU

	During the presentation to doctors on Thursday, Dr. Tania Diener, the SHA’s COVID-19 vaccine strategy chief, said she was once able to tell her colleagues Saskatchewan was leading the nation in vaccine coverage, but the province has since slid into last place.

	“This is not due to a lack of trying…there’s clinics everywhere,” she said. “People are trying to get to the population where they are…unfortunately, our coverage rate has stalled.”

	In the last two weeks, the number of fully vaccinated people in Saskatchewan has climbed by just two per cent, while the number of people who have their first dose has increased by one per cent.

	Overall, 76 per cent of eligible residents have their initial shot and 68 per cent are considered fully vaccinated.

	Vaccination rates are lowest among young people, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Fewer than 60 per cent of people in their teens, 20s and 30s are fully vaccinated.

	As of Aug. 26, 53 per cent of Saskatchewan residents between ages 12-17 are fully vaccinated, along with 53 per cent of those aged 18-29 and 58 per cent of residents in their 30s.

	Of the 258 COVID-19 cases reported on Friday, 181 were in residents under the age of 39 – 162 of those 181 were unvaccinated.

	DELTA DOMINATES & HOSPITALIZATIONS CLIMB

	As the highly transmissible Delta variant moves to put the province in a chokehold, hospitalizations are creeping back into the triple digits.

	According to Dr. Opondo, the Delta variant – which is associated with more severe illness, especially in young people – has become the dominant strain in the province. This week alone saw a 30 per cent increase in confirmed Delta cases throughout Saskatchewan.

	As Delta tightens its grip, the average age of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital is dropping. Dr. Opondo said 37 per cent of current COVID-19 patients in hospital are less that 39 years old.

	Dr. John Froh, deputy chief medical officer and SHA defensive strategy co-chief, said hospitals are in for a challenging few months.

	Non-ICU hospital admissions have increased 60 per cent in the last two weeks while the number of people in the ICU has increased 46 per cent in the same period of time.

	Dr. Froh said hospitals are preparing for a fourth wave surge. By mid-September, health officials will need to plan to have a provincial capacity for 60 ICU beds and 230 acute non-ICU beds, according to Dr. Froh.

	On Friday, there are 22 COVID-19 patients in ICUs across the province. Dr. Froh said they’re still in the green for provincial ICU capacity, meaning the system can effectively meet demand. However, increasing capacity is pushing the system towards yellow, which is when this system is challenged and care is impacted -- indicating a challenging next few months.

Infant primary immunization rates on the decline during pandemic: Manitoba Health,"Aug. 28, 2021 4:16 a.m. CST","
     
     Winnipeg - 
     
    
	Immunization rates in Manitoba infants are down since the beginning of the pandemic, potentially owing to an increase in virtual appointments, according to provincial health data.

	A baby is typically scheduled for multiple routine vaccinations and check-ups in their first year of life, including rotavirus at two, four and six months, pertussis at two, four, six and eighteen months and a first dose of MMRV at one year, which combats measles, mumps, rubella and varicella.

    Advertisement
    
	A full routine immunization schedule can be found here. 

	Manitoba Health said when comparing babies born pre-pandemic, between March 2019 and March 2020, and post-pandemic, between April 2020 and January 2021, both Rotavirus and Pertussis had lower coverage rates for second and third doses, while MMRV first doses also saw a decline.

	Specifically, second doses of pertussis were down 20 per cent and third doses were down 30 per cent.

	Second doses of rotavirus were down 15 per cent, while third doses were down 23 per cent.

	Additionally, first doses of MMRV were 16 per cent lower during COVID-19 than the pre-pandemic cohort.

	Manitoba Health said within Winnipeg, virtual appointments increased which could have had an impact on immunizations.

	Outside of Winnipeg, child and infant immunization is delivered by public health, and the impact of the pandemic may have limited immunization delivery.

	The province recently implemented a vaccine catch-up program parents can enroll their children in. People can book appointments for provincial vaccine sites online or by contacting the vaccine call centre at 1-844-626-8222.

	“Hosts will receive a host package which includes everything they need to get organized along with a few prizes,” the post said.

	The brochure also encourages applicants to follow current public health guidelines.

	Last Friday, RM of Stanley Reeve Morris Olafson told CTV News Winnipeg the parties were not intended for large groups, but a way for the community to reconnect after so much separation.

	“We want people to get together. It’s been 18 months since people associated with each other and it’s opening up slightly, slowly. Right now, I can already see that,” Olafson said at the time. “It’s a small attempt on our part to facilitate some of these events.”

"B.C.'s vaccine passport will 'ostracize' people who can't get the shot, says lawyer","Aug. 28, 2021 3:09 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	When the province announced B.C.’s new COVID-19 vaccine passport, Leigh Eliason was stunned.

	“I’m sad. I’m sad for what this has become,” she said.

	She’s doing much better now but says with no vaccine studies on people with her condition, she’s worried getting the COVID-19 shot could trigger severe symptoms.

	“I’m not an anti-vaxxer. I’m pro-body autonomy and my choice for myself is I’m not comfortable,” she said.

	Beginning Sept. 13, proof of vaccination will be required to go to restaurants, gyms, concerts and other ticketed events. There are no exceptions.

	“These new measures will help reduce transmission and keep our communities safer,” Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer said on Monday.

	But for Eliason, the changes mean she won't be able to watch her daughter on stage.

	“I’m devastated I’m going to miss seeing my daughter perform,” she said.

	Human rights lawyers say they are hearing from many people who can't get vaccinated for medical reasons.

	“The people that we’re hearing from at the Human Rights Clinic are people with allergies to components of the vaccine, maybe people who received a first dose and had a reaction to the shot and have been advised by their doctor not to get the second shot,” says Vancouver lawyer Laura Track.

	Track says she expects the passport mandate to be challenged in court.

	“Our human rights laws in Canada protect people from discrimination on the basis of both disability and religious grounds,” she said.

	Her concerns are echoed by lawyer Christine Van Geyn of the Canadian Constitution Foundation.

	“People who wish they could be vaccinated but can’t be are now sort of ostracized from society and I think that poses a very big constitutional problem,” Van Geyn said.

	“There are reasons people can’t be vaccinated. They are rare but in a province the size of British Columbia, that amounts to a lot of people,” she explained.

	Van Geyn says the province needs to create accommodations in the vaccine passport program for people who can’t be vaccinated because of a disability.

	Eliason also hopes health officials will make exemptions.

	“We’re losing empathy for one another. Everybody’s so angry,” said Eliason. “It’s going to cause a lot of division where we already have so much division.""

	She says her daughters are both vaccinated but understand their mom’s decision.

Proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 test required for City and Colour's Regina concert,"Aug. 27, 2021 9:34 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	Fans will need more than just a ticket to get into City and Colour’s Regina concert this fall.

	The act is slated to perform at the Conexus Arts Centre in Regina on Nov. 28. City and Colour musician Dallas Green said they will require proof of full COVID-19 vaccination or proof of a negative test to gain entry to all venues on City and Colour’s 2021 tour.

	In an email sent out to ticket holders and those considering buying a ticket, Conexus Arts Centre said all fans and staff have to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with the second dose administered at least two weeks before the show.

	The venue said proof of vaccination can include a printed copy or screenshot of an immunization record or the card received when the vaccine was given. The name stated on both documents must match valid ID. If a concert goer is unable to provide proof of the jab, a negative COVID-19 test from 48 hours prior will also be accepted.

	Conexus Arts Centre noted the decision is event-specific and was requested by the performer. Other events will not require proof of vaccination right now, unless otherwise stated.

	City and Colour’s decision is in line with Live Nation Canada’s recently announced policy that requires proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test to attend concerts at select venues.

	A backlash is growing among some B.C. businesses over the province’s incoming vaccine card program. Many have gone online to advertise that they will not be checking for proof of vaccination, in defiance of the public health order.

	The province’s health ministry said Thursday consequences for those businesses that don’t comply could include closure.

	In the city of Kimberley in southeast B.C., one long-time local business has put up a sign to let both vaccinated and unvaccinated customers know they are welcome.

	The sign at Bean Tree Cafe adds that it will not ask for personal information.

	Manager Maigan Bakos said ideally, the business would like not to have to participate in the vaccine card requirement.

	“It’s none of my business whether you choose or not choose,” Bakos said, and added the cafe is still following other COVID-19 protocols. “We encourage masks, obviously, but if you come in without a mask, I’m not going to ask you what your medical conditions are, why you are exempt, or what your reasoning is behind it.”

	Bean Tree Cafe barista Shayena Wood said the business believes people can make their own choices.

	“Our choice is to offer a space that is non-discriminatory, that is pro-choice,” Wood said. “We don’t discriminate on race, on gender, on religious status, marital status.”

	Online, businesses opposed to the province’s incoming vaccine card program have banded together on a Facebook page titled “BC Businesses Against Health Pass.”

	Starting next month, people will be required to produce proof of vaccination for certain non-essential activities, including dining out – whether inside or on a patio. Indoor ticketed sporting events and concerts, movie theatres, casinos, nightclubs, fitness centres and gyms, and organized indoor events such as weddings and conferences will all also require proof of vaccination to attend.

	The new rule does not apply to retail or essential services, including groceries and health care.

	In Esquimalt, the Sunnyside Cafe also shared a message online indicating they would serve “all people who enter.”

	Owner Stephanie Herring said the cafe will not be asking people for “their personal information.”

	“We want to serve everybody,” she said. “That’s how we’ve always been, and that’s how we want to be now.”

	Co-owner Brendan Marshall agreed.

	“We’re not looking to be anti-vax or pro-vax,” he said. “We’re in the middle. We believe people should have the right to choose what they do.”

	The owner of a Kelowna yoga studio posted online that she’s also taking a stand.

	In a video shared on social media, Bliss Yoga Lounge owner Tara Greer said the business wants to stand up for “each and every individual, whether you are vaccinated or not.”

	“I will not stand for this vaccine passport. I believe the only way we’re going to get through this is to stand together,” she said. “This is not about being anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine for that matter. It is about keeping our rights as humans to the freedom of choice of what we put into our own bodies.”

	CTV News Vancouver reached out to businesses around Metro Vancouver that have publicly expressed opposition to the vaccine card program. Some didn’t respond, others declined an interview.

	In a statement, the Ministry of Health said it expects all “relevant” businesses to comply with the health order.

	“The province will be engaging with them over the next several weeks to support them with this work,” the ministry said. “If individuals or businesses do not comply, there are enforcement measures, such as closure, that can be considered.”

	The vaccine card has not been issued yet in B.C. The requirement to show proof of a first dose is scheduled to begin Sept. 13.

Alberta shows signs of uptick in first doses as options shrink for the unvaccinated,"Aug. 27, 2021 11:15 a.m. CST","
     
     CALGARY - 
     
    
	The trickle of Albertans rolling up their sleeves for their first COVID-19 shot shows signs it's increasing.

	On Wednesday 3,689 people got their first shot, well above the ten day average of 2,766 per day.

    Advertisement
    
	""There's been a slight uptick, but I wouldn't say we've been flooded with requests, but we've noticed there's some for sure,"" said Jason Kmit, pharmacist at Polaris Travel Clinic in Airdrie.

	He said it is likely a reaction to some of the increasing pressure of vaccine mandates imposed at international borders, private business and some provincial governments.

	""As a health care provider we just think that people would really just super prioritize this, but sometimes what ends up happening is people just put it off,"" Kmit said.

	While B.C. has imposed a no-exemptions proof-of-vaccination mandate starting Sept. 13 that applies to a wide swath of public spaces, Alberta has allowed businesses to lead the way.

	From the NHL to live music venues and post-secondary institutions, different combinations of immunization proof or rapid test results are increasingly being required to participate in society.

	The ad hoc approach may play well to some, but a U of C Law and Health professor said it could ask more of Albertans while delivering fewer benefits.

	In short, government is best positioned to look at the overall picture.

	""What form of vaccine proof is least able to be forged, is most secure, they can consider things like what medical exemptions should look like, how best to protect privacy,"" said Lorian Hardcastle, associate professor of law at the Cumming School of Medicine.

	In B.C. just shy of 85 per cent of eligible people have received at least one dose while Alberta sits at 77.5 per cent.

	Fully vaccinated numbers see a similar spread: over 76 per cent in BC versus just 69 per cent in Alberta.

	To hit something resembling herd immunity, 90 per cent of the entire population needs both shots.

	""The anti-vaxxers are not going to be persuaded most likely by vaccine mandates, but the entire group of the vaccine hesitant is up for grabs,"" said Hardcastle.

	“I expect we’re going to have lots of questions about it and probably a fairly comprehensive debate too,” Ward 7 Coun. Mairin Loewen told CTV News.

       Saskatoon mayor calls for vaccine passports as city grapples with 'increasingly serious' COVID-19 surgeTwo new COVID-19 related deaths in Sask., 158 additional cases reported U of S will require vaccinations to access campus, citing low rates among those under 30

	He wants to implement a mandatory vaccine policy for all civic facilities and staff, similar to the University of Saskatchewan’s (U of S) vaccine requirements announced earlier this month.

	Starting Sept. 7, the U of S will require all staff, faculty and students to show proof of at least one dose of a World Health Organization approved COVID-19 vaccine before coming onto campus, with proof of a second dose required no later than Oct. 18.

	People not vaccinated will be required to provide regular and frequent negative COVID-19 test results.

	How the city would implement something like this is unclear at the moment, but Loewen said she supports the idea.

	“We know that vaccination is one of the most critical paths to getting out of the pandemic. We are not at the level we need to be in Saskatoon or really in any part of the province with vaccination uptake, and so I think it’s appropriate that as a significant entity in the community, the City of Saskatoon protect its employees and residents,” she said.

	Loewen added that while she understands there are a wide range of opinions, it’s important to listen to what public health experts are saying.

	“The advice that we’re getting from public health officials is that we’re in a very concerning situation in Saskatoon. We need to do things differently if we want better public health outcomes. We need to get more people vaccinated and we need to protect the people who cannot become vaccinated.”

	Ward 9 Coun. Bev Dubois said if she were to vote right now, she would go in favour of a mandatory vaccine policy and would be open to hearing about vaccine passports.

	She said she’s been hearing from people in her ward with similar views.

	“I had a call from an individual that works at the City and that is in my ward, pleading with me to help make vaccines mandatory, saying it’s becoming a difficult situation out there with the vaccinated and the unvaccinated ... I mean, people are concerned and we all want to be healthy. We all want to be safe, and so that’s my priority.”

	On Thursday, Saskatchewan reported two more deaths related to COVID-19 and 158 new cases. Of those cases, the majority were in Saskatoon at 27.

	The motion comes as Mayor Charlie Clark calls for extra measures, such as vaccine passports, as the city deals with rising cases.

	However, Ward 5 Coun. Randy Donauer said his preference is to have a province-wide policy.

	“I think especially when you get into the big, tough issues like Charter arguments and people’s rights, I think the province has hundreds of doctors on staff, we have zero, and I think these type of broad sweeping decisions should be made by the province.”

	Donauer said it’s also important to keep people who are not able to get vaccinated, like kids under 12 years old and those who are immunocompromised, in mind when making a decision.

	“These are very serious issues and I understand why the province and all the different stakeholders are struggling with these decisions because they’re trying to balance the rights of individuals with the rights of the greater population to live in a safe environment and those are not easy things for us to do.”

	“In the meantime, Albertans are encouraged to review the policies of locations and businesses prior to their visit to confirm what forms of vaccination proof will be accepted,” Bourdeau said. “It is recommended that Albertans use the paper immunizations record they received at the time of their immunization as a back-up.”

	Bourdeau said that any Albertan who did not receive a paper copy of their record of immunization or needs another one can request a copy from wherever they received their vaccine doses.

	When asked by CTV News if the new paper or digital card offered by Alberta Health will constitute a vaccine passport or card, Bourdeau replied, ""No.""

	PASSPORT OPPOSITION CONTRIBUTING TO HESITANCY: HEALTH LAW EXPERT  

	Health Minister Tyler Shandro reiterated on Thursday Alberta will not implement a vaccine passport. 

	“To be clear, the Alberta government has not and will not mandate a so-called ‘vaccine passport’ for domestic use,” Shandro said in a series of tweets.

	But his government's refusal to implement a passport muddies the waters and offloads responsibility to the private sector, one University of Calgary health law professor says. 

	""When it's a government-driven initiative, they can think of it more holistically and they can think about things like: What form of vaccine proof is least able to (be?) forged? Is most secure? They can consider things like what medical exemptions should look like, how best to protect privacy. And they can make choices around what types of essential services shouldn't be the subject of a vaccine mandate, and which should,"" commented Lorian Hardcastle with the law faculty and Cumming School of Medicine.  

	""Will the federal government accept your AHS printout as sufficient proof... or are they going to ask for access to those provincial records? In which case it will become a political battle between the two levels of government.""

	Shandro directed anyone in search of proof of vaccine status to use the documents they received at their vaccine clinic or MyHealth Records. He said more than 800,000 Albertans have signed up for the service and the government was working to make it more accessible. 

	Hardcastle considers his and the Alberta government's messaging about vaccine passports as a contributing factor to vaccine hesitancy. 

	""We heard messaging around choice and around 'we will never mandate you to get vaccinated.' And that's political,"" she pointed out. 

	""There was some messaging from the premier and he said that he was concerned vaccine passports would violate the spirit of the health information act, so it was sort of clear that he was walking a semantic line where he couldn't say it was illegal but sort of wanted to nod to those kinds of concerns.""
	In the days after B.C. announced its own vaccine passport program, it saw demand for vaccine appointments jump -- one day, by 200 per cent over the previous week. 

	""I think the more that is inaccessible to them, the more likely they are to be vaccinated,"" Hardcastle said.

	“I’ve seen a lot of back lash on social media. I’m concerned this is becoming increasingly polarizing situation in our community and I understand that there’s still a lot of anxiety about COVID and the vaccines. My intent is not to increase that polarization,” he said.

	“As a community, we have to come to terms with this reality and work together, as we always have, on how to keep people safe and keep our health system from getting overwhelmed and have the right conditions for our economy to recover and businesses to thrive.""

	Sam Farthing is a father of four in Saskatoon. He said he doesn’t want to see the return of restrictions or vaccine passports.

	“Please no, because we need to make these decisions ourselves, have our own freedom to decide what we need to do,” Farthing said.

	“We have freedoms, we have rights, we have to make our own decisions. You can’t tell us what to do … I’m someone who does take precautions, but still, we have to do this ourselves.”

	But a University of Saskatchewan doctor said it’s not so simple.

	“We have rights and responsibilities living in a community, and those have to be balanced. When one individual’s rights put the rest of the community at risk, we limit those rights for a time,” said Dr. Cory Neudorf, a public health and epidemiology physician.

	The new Delta variant is predominant in Saskatoon, according to Neudorf.

	Since it’s more transmissible than the original strain, he said increased preventative measures are necessary and is in favour of a system that allows access based on whether or not you’re vaccinated.

	In Clark’s post, he pointed to wastewater data showing the highest levels of COVID-19 fragments since researchers began monitoring the city's sewage.

	""Fall is coming, schools will be opening, we will have more indoor activities. Things will only get worse,"" Clark said.

	""We are sitting at only 68 per cent of the population vaccinated – we need to get to at least 85 per cent.""

	Clark said policies released by the Western Hockey League, the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan Polytechnic and Amigos are good examples of the steps he feels should be taken.

	Clark also brought up the possibility of making masks mandatory again.

	He said the city is still finalizing policies for its employees, as well as for public services like transit and leisure centres.

Dalhousie University to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination or negative test results for students and staff,"Aug. 26, 2021 5:50 a.m. CST","

	The Maritime's largest university will require proof of COVID-19 vaccination status or negative test results for any students or staff on campus this September.

	In a release issued Wednesday morning, Dalhousie University says all students, faculty and staff accessing university campuses this fall will be asked to provide proof of their vaccination status.

    Advertisement
    
	Those who are not fully vaccinated, or choose not to provide proof of vaccination, will have to undergo COVID-19 testing twice a week and will be required to provide proof that the testing has taken place.

	The requirement will also apply to University of King’s College students and other members of the King’s community on Dalhousie’s campuses.

	The university says that this decision was made after a survey of the community, which received more than 10,000 responses from students, faculty and staff.

	“We continue to have great confidence in vaccination rates among our Dal community; preliminary results of our vaccine survey show that more than 95% of respondents are or plan to be fully vaccinated this fall,” says the release attributed to Frank Harvey, Dalhousie Provost and Vice-President Academic.

	 

	“However, several factors make these extra measures prudent at this time. The first is the more-infectious Delta variant and the emerging fourth wave across North America — largely among un- or under-vaccinated individuals. The second is that details of final phase of Nova Scotia’s re-opening plan have now been shared, in which most public health restrictions (excepting travel) will be lifted as we move into “living with COVID” in an endemic rather than pandemic model. This increases our responsibility to help protect less-vaccinated individuals and prevent outbreaks and breakthrough cases.”

	The school also says masks will continue to be used on campus through September, and may be extended further into the fall term.

	Dalhousie says they will work to ensure equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility concerns related to both vaccination and testing are addressed, and that all personal information, including vaccination status, will be handled in compliance with appropriate privacy legislation.

	Nova Scotia Public Health officials have confirmed that universities and colleges in the province will be able to make their own decisions regarding vaccine requirements.

	Dalhousie is the latest of Nova Scotia's post-secondary schools to announce a proof of vaccination policy, following the Nova Scotia Community College, Mount Saint Vincent and Saint Mary's University.

	The game scheduled for Thursday, Aug. 26 against the Toronto Argonauts was postponed last Sunday.

	'GOTTA GET EVERYBODY VACCINATED'

	In an interview with TSN CFL Insider Dave Naylor, CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the league is learning it can't let its guard down even after months of planning for possible coronavirus outbreaks.

	""The second lesson is you gotta get everybody vaccinated. It's absolutely clear that that is the number one priority,"" Ambrosie told Naylor.

	According to Ambrosie, the majority of cases are unvaccinated. Between that and the possibility Canadians could soon need to provide vaccine status to fly across the country, he said the league will be sending a ""tough"" message to players and personnel who hadn't yet got the shot.

	""We happen to play… the greatest team sport in the history of humankind: the game of football. Everybody relies on everybody else. Well this is a time to show that not only is it the ultimate team sport but we are the ultimate team players.""

	The league hasn't mandated vaccines – a decision it says it is unable to make under the collective bargaining agreement – nor directed clubs on how to welcome fans back into stadiums.

	On Tuesday, the Oilers Entertainment Group announced vaccine status or a recent negative COVID-19 test would be needed to attend events at Edmonton's Rogers Place, from NHL games to touring shows. Later that day, an Elks spokesperson told CTV News Edmonton ""conversations around fan vaccination requirements will be occurring.""

	Edmonton and Saskatchewan are the last CFL teams to not make such requirements of fans in attendance at games.

	Ambrosie also told Naylor no decision had been made yet about rescheduling Thursday's postponed Elks vs. Argonauts game.

	He called it a complex situation to factor in stadium availability and team schedules, but a discussion that wouldn't ""leave any stone unturned in pursuit of the best possible scenario,"" including Edmonton hosting the game.

	""Gotta show the courtesy to the Argos… At this point, I wouldn't take anything off the table.""

     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C. health officials announced 698 new cases of COVID-19 and one related death on Wednesday, hours after another province-wide mask mandate came into effect.

	The update, provided in a written statement from the Ministry of Health, pushed B.C.'s seven-day average for new coronavirus infections to 629 per day, the highest its been since May 10.

    Advertisement
    
	About two-thirds of the latest cases came from the Interior Health and Fraser Health regions, compared to 18 per cent that were identified in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. The remaining 16 per cent came from the Island Health and Northern Health regions.

	Another 702 people also recovered from COVID-19, causing B.C.'s active caseload to decrease slightly to 5,356. The number of coronavirus patients in hospital increased by one, to 139, while the number in intensive care decreased by three, to 75.

	The Ministry of Health also announced two new care home outbreaks, at Brock Fahrini in Vancouver and Spring Valley Care Centre in Kelowna. There are now 14 active outbreaks in B.C.'s health-care system, 11 of which are located in the Interior Health region.

	On top of the renewed mask mandate, which applies to most indoor public spaces, the B.C. government announced this week that proof of vaccination will soon be required to access movie theatres, live sporting events and other discretionary activities and services.

	The decision appears to have prompted thousands of residents to get their shots. Officials said 19,084 people registered for vaccination on Monday and Tuesday, a 192 per cent increase over the same days last week.

	""Getting vaccinated is the most important step we can all take to move out of this pandemic, and the momentum this week is positive news,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a statement Wednesday. ""But there's more work to do, and I encourage everyone to make the best choice to protect themselves, their loved ones and their community - get vaccinated.""

	The temporary vaccine passport system is scheduled to start being phased in on Sept. 13 and remain in place until the end of January 2022, at the earliest.

	As of a few short months ago, health officials anticipated that life in B.C. could be almost back to normal by early September, but the highly contagious Delta COVID-19 variant has upended the province's progress in containing the spread of the disease.

	But provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has stressed that being fully vaccinated still offers strong protection against the variant. According to numbers provided by the Ministry of Health, 68 per cent of the 4,338 infections reported between Aug. 10 and 23 involved people who weren't vaccinated, and another 10 per cent involved people who were only partially vaccinated.

	Similarly, 77 per cent of COVID-19 patients hospitalized between Aug. 17 and 23 were unvaccinated and eight per cent were only partially vaccinated.

	So far, just over 83 per cent of B.C. residents eligible for COVID-19 vaccination have received at least one shot, while 75 per cent have received both. A total of 7,369,741 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines have been administered across the province.

Delta Air Lines will make unvaccinated employees pay charge,"Aug. 26, 2021 12:25 a.m. CST","
     
    
	Delta Air Lines will charge employees on the company health plan US$200 a month if they fail to get vaccinated against COVID-19, a policy the airline's top executive says is necessary because the average hospital stay for the virus costs the airline $40,000.

	CEO Ed Bastian said that all employees who have been hospitalized for the virus in recent weeks were not fully vaccinated.

    Advertisement
    
	The airline said Wednesday that it also will stop extending pay protection to unvaccinated workers who contract COVID-19 on Sept. 30, and will require unvaccinated workers to be tested weekly beginning Sept. 12, although Delta will cover the cost.

       Delta - Ed Bastian memo: COVID-19 update

	Delta stopped short of matching United Airlines, which will require employees to be vaccinated starting Sept. 27 or face termination. However, the $200 monthly surcharge, which starts in November, may have the same effect.

	""This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company,"" Bastian said in a memo to employees.

	Delta is self-insured and sets premiums for its plans, which are administered by UnitedHealthcare.

	Bastian said that 75% of Delta employees are vaccinated, up from 72% in mid-July. He said the aggressiveness of the leading strain of the virus ""means we need to get many more of our people vaccinated, and as close to 100% as possible.""

	""I know some of you may be taking a wait-and-see approach or waiting for full (Food and Drug Administration) approval,"" he told employees. ""With this week's announcement that the FDA has granted full approval for the Pfizer vaccine, the time for you to get vaccinated is now.""

	A growing number of companies including Chevron Corp. and drugstore chain CVS announced they will require workers to get vaccinated after Monday's FDA decision.

	United and Delta already require new hires to be vaccinated. Two smaller carriers, Hawaiian and Frontier, have said they will require either vaccination or regular testing for current employees. Other major U.S. airlines, including American and Southwest, said Wednesday that they are encouraging employees to get vaccinated but have not required it.

	Delta's requirement for weekly testing of unvaccinated employees will start Sept. 12, and the requirement that the unvaccinated wear masks indoors takes effect immediately.

	Fueled by the now-dominant Delta variant of the virus, new reported cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. have topped 150,000 a day, the highest level since late January. Nationally the rate of increase has slowed, but the variant threatens to overwhelm emergency rooms in parts of the country.

	On Tuesday, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, where Delta is based, ordered members of the National Guard to 20 hospitals across the state to help deal with a surge that is larger than the national average.

	Southwest, Spirit and Frontier have blamed the rise of the delta variant for a slowdown in customers booking flights, and U.S. air travel remains down more than 20% from pre-pandemic 2019.

	The Delta CEO referred to the COVID-19 mutation that originated in India by its medical name, B.1.617.2, rather than the more common term, the delta variant.

	Seven cases are contacts of previously confirmed cases, two are travel related and one is under investigation.

	Two new cases were reported in the Fredericton region (Zone 3), both involving people age 19 and under who were contacts of previously confirmed cases.

	Three new cases were reported in the Miramichi region (Zone 7) involving:

	
		one person in their 60s
	
		one person in their 70s
	
		one person in their 80s


	All three cases are contacts of previously confirmed cases.

	There are currently three patients in hospital in New Brunswick due to COVID-19, with no one in an intensive care unit.

	CHILDREN TURNING 12 NOW ELIGIBLE FOR VACCINES

	New Brunswick also announced Tuesday that the province is expanding its COVID-19 vaccination eligibility to include children who are turning 12 this year.

	“We know that there will continue to be cases in schools in the coming year,” said Education and Early Childhood Development Minister Dominic Cardy in a release.

	“This change will help support healthy and safe schools by allowing a greater number of students to be vaccinated, particularly in schools with younger children. If you are eligible, please go get your shot and help protect our schools.”

	With the change, number of New Brunswickers who are eligible to receive a vaccine has increased to 696,218 from the previous 693,386.

	VACCINE UPDATE

	As of Tuesday, 73.8 per cent of New Brunswickers age 12 and older are fully vaccinated and 83.8 per cent have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

	The province says due to the addition of nearly 3,000 children turning 12 this year to the eligible numbers, it may appear there has been a reduction in some of the province's vaccination rates.

	In addition, the province says they discovered that 8,159 vaccinations, including about 7,800 second doses, were not recorded across all systems during a routine review. This issue has been rectified and is reflected in Tuesdays vaccination rates on the COVID-19 dashboard.

	In total, 1,097,337 vaccine doses have been administered in New Brunswick.

	If you have not yet had your first or second dose, you are encouraged to go to a mobile or walk-in clinic or to book an appointment through a participating pharmacy or at a Vitalité or Horizon Health Network clinic.

	All eligible New Brunswickers can book their second dose appointments now for a date that is at least 28 days after their first dose.

	If you have an appointment for a vaccine but were able to get vaccinated sooner elsewhere, please be sure to contact your pharmacy or regional health authority clinic to cancel the appointment you no longer need. This will help ensure that someone else in your community can obtain their vaccination sooner.

	COVID-19 CASE DATA

	New Brunswick has had 2,687 cumulative cases of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.

	In total, 2,473 people have recovered, and 46 people have died in the province from COVID-19.

	Public health says 1,379 tests were completed in New Brunswick on Monday. A total of 401,531 tests have been processed since the start of the pandemic.

	The number of cases are broken down by New Brunswick’s seven health zones:

	
		Zone 1 – Moncton region: 710 confirmed cases (97 active cases)
	
		Zone 2 – Saint John region: 329 confirmed cases (16 active cases)
	
		Zone 3 – Fredericton region: 494 confirmed cases (28 active cases)

	""Three of them were community-acquired, which means we don't know how they acquired their infection,"" Gardner said during his COVID-19 live update on Tuesday. ""Two are from close contacts of a case, and one is under investigation. None of them had been immunized,"" he said of those admitted to hospital with the virus.

	The daily moving average of new cases has been increasing and is now above 10 cases per day compared to an average of three per day in July.

	Most local infections were reported throughout the pandemic in the southern parts of the region, including Barrie, Bradford, New Tecumseth, Essa and Innisfil.

	The cases reported Tuesday are in Barrie (6), New Tecumseth (5), Tay (2), Wasaga Beach (2), Bradford (1), Essa (1), Orillia (1), Innisfil (1), Springwater (1), and Tiny (1).

	A total of 256 Simcoe Muskoka residents died after contracting COVID-19, including six deaths in June, four in July and one so far in August.

	VACCINATION LATEST

	Public health reports that 71 per cent of Simcoe Muskoka residents have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

	Currently, 81 per cent of residents 12 and older have had at least one shot, including 75 per cent of students 12 to 17.

	Gardner noted that vaccinated residents could still become infected with COVID-19 but are less likely to become severely ill.

	""Immunized individuals who become cases, they are just as capable of transmitting to other people,"" Gardner said.

	Meanwhile, the region's top doctor is calling on the province to finalize and release modelling for the virus in the fall, adding he fears cases could soar among unvaccinated students as schools are set to reopen to in-person learning.

	Currently, only children born in 2009 or earlier are eligible for the vaccine.

	""We could have potentially, a large number of cases and hospital admissions that it could, in particular, impact younger people because it will be clustered overwhelmingly among the unvaccinated or the incompletely vaccinated,"" he said.

	ONTARIO COVID-19 LATEST

	The province listed 486 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, marking the lowest count in five days.

	Ontario reports of the new cases in the past 24 hours, 372 were in people either not fully vaccinated or whose vaccine status is unknown.

	An expert on Ontario's Science Advisory Table said he expects the province to see case counts rise to about 1,300 daily in roughly three weeks.

	On Tuesday, the province also noted 18 COVID-19-related deaths, though it said 16 of those happened more than two months ago and are being logged as a data clean-up.

	WHERE TO FIND A VACCINE WALK-IN CLINIC

	The health unit plans to close its mass immunization clinics on Friday.

	Vaccines will continue to be available to residents at the COVID-19 vaccine centre on Sperling Drive in Barrie until Sept. 29.

	""To have to choose between getting it and your education is heartbreaking,"" Dolinski said.

	Post-secondary isn't the only sector looking to mandate vaccinations.

	On Monday, Doctors Manitoba recommended the province implement a vaccine mandate in the health care sector and urged public and private employers to do the same.

	Kristjan Thompson, president of the organization, said it's the duty of health care professionals to protect their patients - and getting vaccinated is the best way to do that.

	""There are a lot of tools that we use in the fight against COVID-19, but vaccination is the best tool that we have and the evidence supports it, and we know it's safe,"" Thompson said.

	Doctors Manitoba said vaccination mandates for health care workers are already commonplace. Those wanting to train in medical school and practice have to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

	Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, said he supports any initiatives that encourage Manitobans to get the shot.

	On Monday, Brandon University announced it is partnering with Prairie Mountain Health to make walk-in vaccine appointments available for students, staff and the faculty during the first week of the fall term.

	Dolinksi said people who are unsure about taking the vaccine shouldn't be mandated.

	""They might be a small group, but they have right to say, 'Hey, I need to make this choice for myself.'""

	Doctors Manitoba said those who are unsure about the vaccine should talk to their doctor to discuss the concerns.

'Appears to be a fourth wave beginning': Iveson calls Alberta COVID-19 numbers concerning,"Aug. 24, 2021 9:39 a.m. CST","

	Edmonton’s mayor is concerned about the rising number of COVID-19 cases across Alberta as more employees return to working in person and students return to school.

	Don Iveson said at a media availability on Monday that the city is exploring a vaccine mandate for City of Edmonton employees and council could bring back mandatory masking measures as case counts continue to rise.

	When asked if masks will remain mandatory while on public transit, taxis, or ride shares beyond Sept. 27, Iveson said he personally believes the measure would be useful but depends on if council believes it is a priority.

	“My view continues to be that masking would be an appropriate measure for the city to take, certainly in our own workplaces and in our facilities and services, like public transit,” the mayor said, adding that masks are the lowest cost measure people can take that has had its effectiveness proven throughout the world.

	“There’s probably value in looking through the fourth wave here at broader application of a masking requirement in our community.”

	Iveson said that masking would be stronger as a public health measure should the province implement a mandate for it so that metropolitan regions like Edmonton have consistency across municipal boundaries.

	“I’ve been talking to members of council, including those who had voted to repeal masking earlier in that contentious decision, and they’re certainly hearing from the public that there’s some desire to look at continued masking requirements,” he added. “Masking is one of the best tools in the tool kit to help blunt the impact of a potential fourth wave.”

	The mayor said the city could implement a vaccine mandate for municipal employees. Currently, city workers are being asked to anonymously and voluntarily disclose their vaccination status.

	“With other major public sector employees, including the Government of Canada and the City of Toronto, requiring vaccination, it’s something we’re looking at very closely,” Iveson said.

	He added that the city’s legal team is examining the privacy and enforceability issues of mandating all workers to receive a COVID-19 immunization.

	“There are obvious occupational health and safety upsides, and personally, I think those outweigh the other issues,” Iveson said. “Ultimately, there’s a lot of complexity that needs to be worked out in the Edmonton context.”

	The mayor said council will receive an update about the potential measure from city administration Monday next week.

	People who can't get vaccinated against COVID-19 for medical reasons won't be exempt from B.C.’s upcoming vaccine passport system, nor will those who choose not to get immunized for religious reasons.

	Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, who announced the requirement Monday afternoon, said those individuals will have to miss out on discretionary services and activities, such as dining in restaurants and attending live sporting events, until the proof-of-vaccination requirement is lifted next year.

	""Those rare people who have a medical reason why they can't be immunized … they will not be able to attend those events during this period.""

	The same goes for people who refuse to get immunized because of a religious conviction, though officials noted the passport system does not apply to worship services.

	""We've worked really closely with faith-based groups across the province over this past very long year-and-a-half, and we have in place guidelines that they are using to help support faith-based services coming back,"" Henry said.

	The B.C. government is giving the public a grace period of until Sept. 13 before the system comes into effect. At that point, residents will be expected to have at least one dose of vaccine to take part in things like indoor weddings, conferences and a host of other discretionary activities and events.

	By Oct. 24, full immunization will be required. The requirement has a tentative end date of Jan. 31, 2022.

	The same rules will apply to out-of-province and international visitors as well. Officials said B.C.'s pending vaccine card system will be compatible with immunization records from other Canadian jurisdictions, including Quebec, which was the first province to announce a vaccine passport requirement.

	Henry noted that international travellers already need to provide proof of their vaccination status using the ArriveCAN app.

	The only exemption currently planned is for children under the age of 12 who are currently ineligible to receive any of the COVID-19 vaccines.

	""They will be able to attend sporting events or go to a restaurant if the parents or the adults they're with are fully vaccinated,"" Henry said.

	The system was announced amid an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases in B.C. fuelled by the highly contagious Delta variant. Henry said 90 per cent of cases recorded over the past month have involved people who are unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated.

	""The science is clear,"" she said. ""When you are vaccinated it means that you are less likely to get infected, if you are infected you shed virus for a shorter period of time, you're less likely to transmit to other people, and you're much less likely to have a severe illness that leads to hospitalization.""

	“We continue to be concerned with the high case rates in our community. As the fourth wave is upon us, it is critical that we do not forget the public health measures that helped us through the first three waves of this pandemic,” a statement from medical officer of health Dr. Wajid Ahmed said. “Actions like staying home if you are sick, following face covering guidelines, washing or sanitizing your hands often, and limiting your close contacts will help to keep you safe and slow the spread of this virus. The best way to ensure your own safety as well as that of those around you is to get vaccinated as soon as possible”

	BREAKDOWN OF NEW CASES:

	
		49 cases are close contacts of confirmed cases
	
		30 cases are community acquired
	
		5 cases are travel related
	
		69 cases are still under investigation


	WECHU says 391 cases are currently active:

	
		202 variants of concern (VOC) cases are active
	
		189 non-VOC cases are active.


	There have been 2,510 preliminary or confirmed variant of concern cases identified in Windsor-Essex.

	The health unit says there are nine confirmed COVID-19 cases in the hospital in the region.

	“Ninety, 95 per cent, eight out of nine patients in the hospital are unvaccinated,” Windsor Regional Hospital CEO David Musyj said. “And unfortunately our last two deaths in the hospital because of COVID were totally unvaccinated.”

	He said its feeling “eerily similar” to what was experienced at the start of the second wave with community numbers quickly increasing and encourages anyone with symptoms to get tested.

	“You can book, get swabbed if you’re symptomatic because finding out if you’re positive for COVID will hopefully help stem the tie to the spread as well,” he says. “Don’t ignore it.”

	There are seven workplace outbreaks in Windsor-Essex.

	The death toll related to COVID-19 is at 439 people.

	Musyj is urging anyone who has yet to receive the COVID-19 shot to do so, noting the local vaccination rates are on the low side.

	“Vaccines work however our vaccine rates in Windsor-Essex are even lower than province. They’re not where they need to be. especially for that 12-29 age group,” he says.

	Musyj says roughly 50 per cent of the 12-29 age group are vaccinated.

	“It will prevent you from getting you into critical care, it will prevent your death. So get vaccinated if you care about yourself. Get vaccinated if you care about your loved ones,” he says.

	WINDSOR-ESSEX COUNTY RESIDENTS VACCINATED:

	
		297,135 WEC residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine
	
		27,821 WEC residents have received only 1 dose of a vaccine
	
		269,314 WEC residents have received both doses of a vaccine


	A total of 566,499 doses have been administered to WEC residents

	
		77.5 per cent of WEC residents 12+ have received at least 1 dose
	
		69.9 per cent of WEC residents 12+ are fully vaccinated

	“For these students and their families, the vaccination and this lottery have also shown them a path forward with new options and new opportunities for learning and a lifetime of success,” Ewasko said.

	Ten Manitobans, aged 12 to 17, won $25,000 scholarships for receiving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on or before August 2.

	These individuals have each won a scholarship worth $25,000:

		Chelsea Thiessen;
	
		Bea Catalla;
	
		Kaden Rozdeba;
	
		Kayla Harper;
	
		Crosby Wright;

		Jordyn Recksiedler;
	
		Emma Benoit; and
	
		Shaira Garcia.


	Seven of the winners attended the announcement to receive their cheques and Ewasko said the other three were unable to attend.

	“I felt like I did something good towards everyone else and my family to keep them safe,” Garcia said.

	Garcia is heading into grade 12 and wants to become a chef after graduating. She plans on enrolling in Red River College’s culinary program.

	Emma Benoit, a student heading into grade 12, plans to enter a psychology program at Red River College after graduation. Benoit said she’s a “huge advocate” for vaccines.

	“I chose to get vaccinated because I missed seeing my friends and I wanted to stay safe,” Benoit said.

	“I’d like to congratulate them all, and wish them the best of luck in their lives and studies going forward,” Ewasko said in a statement. “They have bright futures, and we are confident these scholarships will be put to great use.”

	The scholarships were given out regardless of health region and will be held in trust until winners choose their post-secondary education plans.

	Last week, the province announced the first set of winners of the $100,000 prizes for Manitobans 18 and older.

	Manitoba will be holding a second lottery in September for eligible residents who received both vaccine doses on or before Sept. 6. Prizes for the September draw include three $100,000 prizes in the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, one $100,000 prize in each of the remaining health regions, and 10 $25,000 scholarships for youth aged 12 to 17.

	Manitobans are automatically entered into the lottery once they meet the vaccine requirements but can choose to opt-out.

"Reduced contact tracing, patients warehoused in ER as Interior Health struggles","Aug. 22, 2021 11:52 p.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	Officials are blaming the twin pressures of COVID-19 and wildfire evacuations for a strained health-care system that’s seeing exhausted workers asked to dive into the region’s worst coronavirus outbreaks. 

	CTV News has learned that health authorities across B.C. are asking doctors and nurses to volunteer for secondment to Interior Health, where frontline workers and civic officials are painting a troubling portrait of short-staffed facilities closing early with patients stalled in the emergency department.

    Advertisement
    
	“We are asking for any health-care provider able and willing to be deployed to provide temporary assistance to Interior Health to sign up on the province’s Emergency Health Provider Registry,” read a memo sent to Vancouver Island health-care workers. “We recognize that all regions across the province are experiencing staffing challenges.”   COVID-19 in B.C.: 1st case update of the week includes 3 days of dataFull coverage at CTVNews.ca/CoronavirusIs B.C. flooding affecting the province's COVID-19 numbers?

	While Health Minister Adrian Dix emphasized the memos cited wildfire evacuations as the driver behind the plea for help, the province’s top doctor acknowledged that was, in fact, a secondary reason.

	""There are many different issues affecting communities across Interior Health – not the least of which is COVID 19 – but also the displacement of communities and the volatility of the wildfire season,"" acknowledged provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, though she downplayed the significance of the request.

	“I'm not sure I would call the situation dire. People are exhausted and this is a pre-emptive measure.""

	CTV News asked Emergency Health Services, Fraser Health and Vancouver Coastal Health how many patients, COVID-19-related or otherwise, had been transferred out of the Interior to hospitals in the Lower Mainland. None of the three agencies would say, despite initially indicating they would provide a response.

	Interior Health would not provide hospital capacity statistics, despite multiple requests from CTV News, and Health Minister Adrian Dix has been vague about how many surgeries have been cancelled due to the fourth wave of the pandemic.

	When asked how it was possible that the provincial hot spot for the spread of the virus has no public exposure notices, nor workplaces shut down, Henry insisted that there were no unknown sources of transmission. But, she also revealed that contact tracing in Interior Health has been scaled back to only high-risk environments due to staffing shortages; she did not explain how the paradoxical statements lined up.

	THE SITUATION BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

	Henry said most of the people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 in B.C. are unvaccinated. Their cases are putting added pressure on hospitals in Nelson, Vernon, Kamloops, Keremeos and other communities in the Thompson-Cariboo and Shuswap areas.

	An emergency physician in Kelowna says doctors are still able to accept patients of all needs without excessive waits at that city’s hospital, but the coronavirus is taking up valuable resources and exhausting beleaguered staff, who are continuing to follow safety protocols to prevent any potential spread of the virus in the hospital. 

	""Patients are being warehoused in emergency because they can't go up to the wards because the wards are being occupied by such a large number of COVID patients,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Eppler, estimating that half of the ICU beds at Kelowna General Hospital are taken up by COVID-19 patients.

	“The reason we're seeing this right now is because we have unvaccinated people – younger people anywhere from 20 to 50 – and some of them getting very sick,” Eppler added. “I mean people in their 40s being intubated and on a ventilator.""

	He says nearly all the COVID-19 patients the hospital is seeing are unvaccinated.

	On one occasion, a patient in their 50s came into the emergency department via ambulance, admitting that they’d tested positive for COVID-19 but hadn’t told their family.

	“They were on the verge of intubation and when I told them they were very sick they said, 'With what?’” said Eppler. “Even though they knew they had COVID, even though they couldn't breathe, they still in their mind were denying they were sick from the COVID itself.""

	There are 129 people with COVID-19 in B.C. hospitals right now, the highest number since June 17. There are 59 in ICU, requiring special care and safety precautions.

	SMALLER COMMUNITIES STRUGGLING WITH VACCINATION RATES BELOW PROVINCIAL AVERAGE

	Several of B.C.’s smaller communities are grappling with reduced service hours as a long-term staffing shortage is exacerbated by COVID-19 and wildfires, through civic leaders are often kept in the dark about details.

	“Getting hard data from Interior Health is almost impossible,” said Merlin Blackwell, mayor of Clearwater, B.C.

	“The lack of information is one of the biggest anxieties in a community like ours, so putting out fires on social media is my main job right now other than being mayor.""

	Blackwell said he can’t get statistics on how many COVID-19 cases are in his community, nor when the next bi-monthly vaccination clinic will take place.

	Clearwater’s Dr. Helmcken Memorial Hospital is currently only open 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. because it’s short several nurses and doctors required to run it 24-7. That means any medical emergencies require a paramedic callout and a 90-minute drive to Kamloops, bypassing the community of Barriere, where the local clinic is also closing early due to staff shortages.

	""A lot of people aren't happy doing this job anymore and they're deciding to opt out,"" said Blackwell. “We've put people through the wringer and some of it's our own behaviour around not vaccinating and masks.""

	EMPHASIS ON VACCINES IN REGION BELOW THE PROVINCIAL AVERAGE

	While 83 per cent of eligible British Columbians 12 and older have been vaccinated with at least one dose, several areas of Interior Health have vaccination rates in the high 60s and 70s. 

	""Most health-care workers view (the fourth wave) as something that's preventable with what I sincerely believe is a very safe intervention – that is the COVID vaccine,"" said Eppler. “The vaccine is safe – a lot more safe than getting COVID.""

	Experts estimate up to a third of people with symptomatic COVID-19 infections will become long-haulers. While the vaccines are universally believed to lessen the symptoms in the event of infection, it’s not clear whether they can prevent someone who’s infected from having those symptoms for many months, and doctors still advise following precautions to avoid infection.

Calgarians remain cautious as COVID-19 infections increase,"Aug. 21, 2021 10:15 a.m. CST","

	As COVID-19 infection rates are increasing ahead of the new school year, some Calgary parents feel uneasy.

	“I’ve got two children returning to school after being home for the year that don’t have access to the vaccine, they’re not 12 yet,” said Mary Lang.

    Advertisement
    
	Lang said her family has just slowly started to open their bubble.

	“We’ve been extremely cautious over the last year and we’ve gone back to only outside, we have one member going into the cafe, we never really stopped masking anyway.”

	Chase Friesen said she’s been cautious about COVID-19 and that isn’t about to change with infection numbers in the triple digits.

	“I still wear a mask everywhere I go like on the train and into every building I go into,” said Friesen. “I feel it's important to protect people especially service workers who have been through this the entire time, protect them and protect people who can’t get vaccinated.”

	Friday the province reported 763 new cases. Hospitalizations increased by 23, bringing the number of people in hospital to 221. The last time Alberta saw a jump like this in hospitalization numbers was April 24.

	In June, when the premier announce the province’s open for summer plan, Jason Kenney said he couldn’t imagine a fourth wave hitting Alberta.

	“We just don’t see that scenario…This is open for good, not just open for summer. We will have to from time to time address localized outbreaks,” said Kenney at a June 18 press conference.

	But the fourth wave is here nevertheless.

	“It’s a consequence of (the) Delta (variant) being present and being dominant but also just the increased connectivity of people right now,” said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, infectious disease specialist.

	Saxinger said the trend will likely continue as more people move indoors with the return to work and school.

	Saxinger said even though the healthcare system isn’t overwhelmed right now, the increase of cases and hospitalizations is concerning.

	“I expected that cases would go up as we relaxed everything. I expected that cases would be higher in younger age groups. I did not expect that we’d be seeing a hospitalization uptick already.”

	Saxinger said even fully-vaccinated people can take steps to be cautious including choosing outdoor settings when gathering, wearing masks indoors, paying attention to hand hygiene and also staying within networks of vaccinated people.

	LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY

	The opposition is criticizing the provincial government for what it calls a lack of accountability and says more needs to be done to get first and second doses in arms.

	“This government should be working aggressively to make vaccination as easy and attractive as possible. Beyond this the Kenney government should suspend its plans to tear down the test, trace, isolate system on September 27 and instead set a benchmark for success tied to one of the key indicators,” said David Shepherd, NDP critic for health.

	Local businesses are also watching the numbers increase and worry they could take another hit as infections increase.

	“It certainly is concerning,” said Darcy Anderson, owner of Trapped Escape Room.

	Anderson said her staff are taking whatever precautions they can to stay open.

	“All the staff is all double vaccinated, they continue to wear masks throughout the day, we are continuing to clean before and after each group.”

	Anderson said one advantage for them is all their bookings are private so they keep groups in their own cohorts and they are able to keep groups spaced apart.

	“I’m feeling like I fell off a boat, asked for a life jacket, and they threw me an anchor,” he said.

	Point Roberts relies heavily on revenue from Canadians, who travel to the small enclave in droves for leisure activities in the spring and summer months. With Canadians unable to visit the community since March 2020, Calder and some Washington politicians fear Point Roberts could turn into a ghost town.

	“Washington State people support the idea,” said Calder. “The federal government says no. Canada, to its credit, is doing more for a foreign place, Point Roberts, than our own government is.”

	In a statement to CTV News Vancouver, Mike Faulk, the press secretary for Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee, said:

	“We are disappointed by this decision. There ought to be a way to accommodate border communities bearing the burden of the closure … We will continue to urge the (Biden) administration to make progress on this issue as soon as possible.”

	Inslee isn’t the only Washington State politician speaking against the extended closure. Patty Murray, U.S. Senator for Washington State, released a statement on Friday morning, saying:

	“This is the wrong decision by the (Biden) administration — there must at the very least be an exemption for Point Roberts as we work to safely reopen the U.S.-Canada border.”

	Canada reopened its land border to American travellers on Aug. 9. Visitors from the U.S. planning to cross into Canada must be fully vaccinated and have proof of a negative COVID-19 test.

	Meanwhile, Washington State is dealing with all-time high rates of COVID-19 transmission and hospitalizations. Across the state, an average of five to 10 people are dying of COVID-related illnesses daily. Fifty-nine per cent of Washington state residents are fully vaccinated. However, in Point Roberts, roughly 87 per cent have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.

	“We’re trying as hard as we can,” said Calder. “We’ve got the best (immunization) record of anybody, and we’re treated the worst. It’s bizarre.”

Winnipeg councillor renewing calls for front-facing city staff to be vaccinated,"Aug. 21, 2021 7:36 a.m. CST","
     
     Winnipeg - 
     
    
	Whether going to a Winnipeg Jets game, heading off to a university campus, or working for one of Canada’s largest banks, you’re required to be fully vaccinated.

	Now, a Winnipeg city councillor is renewing calls for a double vaccination policy for city employees who have direct contact with the public.

    Advertisement
    
	“I think we can collaborate and make this happen very smoothly,” said Coun. Kevin Klein (Charleswood-Tuxedo-Westwood).

	“We can relocate a person to a different position. There’s all kinds of things that we can do.”

	Klein said there would be exemptions for those with religious or medical reasons.

	Similar policies were put it place by other municipal governments this week. In Toronto, COVID-19 vaccinations will be mandatory for all city employees and transit workers within the next two months, as cases there rise during the fourth wave.

	The Town of Banff has also mandated vaccinations for all of its employees, saying staff who aren’t fully vaccinated within six weeks could risk losing their job.

	Bioethicist Arthur Schafer said people who refuse likely won’t get very far.

	“My view is that the legal challenges will fail, unless those who reject mandatory vaccinations can show that it isn’t necessary in their work situation,” said Schafer. He also noted workplaces would need to make an effort to accommodate those with concerns.

	CUPE Local 500, the union representing more than 5,000 City of Winnipeg employees, said voluntary vaccinations work best.

	“Vaccine mandates shouldn’t take the place of proper protective equipment and ventilation and cleaning,” said CUPE Local 500 president Gord Delbridge.

	The Amalgamated Transit Union said it remains concerned for the health and safety of all transit employees and riders, and understands and respects that some may have medical concerns or religious beliefs that may prevent them from being vaccinated.

	“We must balance human rights and labour laws with the public health orders,” said Romeo Ignacio, ATU 1505 president.

	“Although bus operators deal with members of the public frequently, the Province has stated that the driver shields installed in the buses should protect drivers from COVID-19 transmissions, and vice versa.”

	The city said it’s following provincial public health orders and, at this time, there are no requirements in those orders for staff or visitors to city facilities to be fully vaccinated.

	“The city continues to be diligent in following COVID-19 safety protocols, and remains committed to requiring masks inside City-operated facilities, enforcing indoor capacity limits, and encouraging physical distancing,” said a city spokesperson in an email to CTV News.

	The federal government recently announced it intends to make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory across the federal public service, and will require that all commercial air, interprovincial train and cruise ship passengers be fully vaccinated no later than October.

	“I think it’s going to be very popular among employees, as well as employers, to require vaccination because if you’re vaccinated, you’re less likely to be infected,” said Schafer.

	Although New Brunswick is no longer under a mandatory order, the school year will still include several pandemic measures, including mask-use and mandatory vaccines among staff.

	Education Minister Dominic Cardy said Friday morning the measures are necessary to keep unvaccinated children safe.

	""I know that nearly all staff and teachers have already gotten their vaccine and are looking to get their second shot if they have yet,"" Cardy said. ""And we saw in the spring when a group of high school teachers had the chance to get vaccinated, we saw rates of uptake over 90 per cent.""

	Cardy has been a proponent for mandatory vaccines – and says he would support making it mandatory for students to get the shot too.

	Staff or teachers that choose not to get the vaccine will be tested and have to wear a mask at all times. The details on testing are still to come, says Dr. Cristin Muecke.

	Back-to-school measures are different for children in kindergarten to Grade 8, than those in high school.

	Small class sizes or bubbles will no longer exist, but for kindergarten to grade eight students, masks will be required in indoor common areas. Assemblies and concerts will remain virtual and visitors will be limited.

	High school students will return to full-time, in-person learning, instead of the day-on-day off schedule they had last year.

	Those students will also need to be masked during assemblies and in common areas of school buildings until 90 per cent of students in their health zones are vaccinated.

	""We believe that continuing the use of masks in schools, in common areas, along with other measures such as frequent hand washing and use of outdoor spaces where appropriate will minimize disruptions and limit the spread of the virus until further vaccination is possible,"" Dr. Muecke said.

	Visitors at high schools will also be limited and all students will have to disinfect their own desks.

	Students of all ages will also be required to wear a mask on buses.

	Schools will be subject to frequent cleaning and fans will not be allowed in classrooms. If the outdoor temperature or humidex value is 36 C or above, students will learn from home.

	Cardy says if one COVID-19 case is identified in a school, students will switch to remote learning and the building will be closed for at least one day to allow for contact tracing and a risk assessment.

	The New Brunswick Teachers' Association president had a ""prior commitment"" and was unable to comment on the plan Friday.

	But parent Teri McMackin, whose son is starting kindergarten in September, says the plan appears to balance safety and students' experience.

	""I wanted to make sure when he started school that he had a good experience and that this was, you know, king of what I remember when I started school and making friends and the social aspect so I feel like these restrictions are still going to allow those things to happen,"" she said.

COVID-19 booster shots not on the table in Sask. at this time: SHA,"Aug. 20, 2021 1:26 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	Despite a third COVID-19 vaccine dose being approved for travelers, the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) said it is not currently considering implementing a booster shot strategy.

	Laveena Tratch, the SHA’s Vaccine Section Chief for Regina, told CTV News boosters could be discussed further down the road if evidence suggests they are necessary.

	“The evidence is not indicating that we need to be doing a booster dose for individuals and so we are watching that data closely,” Tratch said, in an interview with CTV Morning Live Regina.

       Sask. approves third dose of COVID-19 vaccine for international travel WHO says no need for COVID-19 booster jabs for nowU.S. to begin offering COVID-19 vaccine booster shots in September

	“When we need it for medical reasons, which is to increase your immunity against COVID-19, then certainly more information will come and we will be certainly putting forward that strategy.”

	The Government of Saskatchewan announced that additional COVID-19 vaccinations would be made available for anyone who plans to travel and needs to meet specific vaccine requirements.

	The move comes as some countries – and cruise lines – said they will not consider travellers with mixed doses of COVID-19 vaccines to be fully vaccinated.

	The SHA clarified these third shots are different than the booster shots currently being discussed around the world.

	“The booster doses are really meant to improve your immunity against the COVID-19 vaccine and that has not been approved in Canada at this point in time,” Tratch said.

	The province said residents who received a mix of AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna can get a third dose to match the brand of their second shot – as long as their second shot was Pfizer or Moderna.

	According to the government, people who received two doses of AstraZeneca are able to “complete a schedule to support international travel requirements” and get two more doses of a matching mRNA vaccine, like Pfizer or Moderna.

	If you’re not planning on traveling, the SHA said there is no need for a third shot at this time, as it is only recommended for residents looking to match vaccine requirements.

	“Individuals who are not traveling don’t actually need to have that third dose. A mix and match does provide you with protection against the COVID-19, it’s just we’re offering it for purposes of travel,” Tratch said.

	PREPARING FOR BACK TO SCHOOL

	The SHA recommends anyone heading back to school or work this fall make sure they are fully vaccinated, if they are eligible.

	“Certainly finish off your doses, schedule your second one to make sure that you are fully protected against the variant because it is highly contagious and as data showed, it is still transmissible even with people who’ve had both doses,” Tratch said.

	“You don’t get as sick but you can still transmit it to those around you.”

	In a news release, the University of Winnipeg (U of W) said proof of full vaccination will be required to attend campus this fall.

	James Currie, the interim president and vice-chancellor of the university, said the school wants to ensure its return to in-person learning is safe and successful.

	“Vaccines are the best protection we have against COVID-19. By ensuring that everyone on campus is protected, we go the extra mile to keep Manitoba healthy and increase the likelihood of an even fuller campus reopening for the winter term,” Currie said in a news release.

	U of W notes that for the fall term, the campus is closed to the public. Students, staff, and faculty members who are allowed on campus will enter through a controlled access point where they must show proof of vaccination. The university said for those who don’t comply with the vaccine mandate, it is considering remote learning/working options, as well as proof of a negative COVID-19 test.

	The U of W is also implementing a mask mandate, enhanced cleaning, and upgraded ventilation.

	The university’s vaccine mandate does not apply to high school students at UWinnipeg Collegiate, or to members of the fitness centre or other external organizations that use space in the Axworthy Health and RecPlex.

	THE UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA

	The University of Manitoba (U of M) released a statement saying it is requiring faculty, staff, students, and campus visitors to be fully vaccinated. It noted that those who are eligible need to have their first dose by Sept. 22 and their second dose by the end of October.

	The university’s vaccine mandate will be in place for the balance of the 2021/22 school year, with more details set to come.

	Michael Benarroch, president and vice-chancellor of the U of M, said facilitating this vaccine protocol will require more consultation and planning.

	“At this time, UM is asking everyone to ensure they are fully vaccinated against COVID as soon as possible, and will continue to require those on campus to wear a mask and maintain social distancing,” he said.

	RED RIVER COLLEGE

	Red River College (RRC) said it is making vaccinations a condition for students and employees coming to campus for the fall term. The college noted it is taking a “staged approach” with first doses required by Sept. 10 and second doses required by Oct. 17.

	RRC’s vaccine policy includes students living in RRC’s residence and staff working at all the Winnipeg and regional campuses.

	The college is also keeping its existing safety protocols in place, including mandatory masks, limiting capacity, and distributing masks.

	RRC notes that it is not mandating anyone get the COVID-19 vaccine, adding that a process is in development for people to be able to present documentation for medical and religious/creed-based exemptions to the vaccine.

	ASSINIBOINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

	Assiniboine Community College (ACC) is adopting a policy to require students, staff, contractors, and visitors to its campus to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

	ACC said it believes a vaccine mandate adds a layer of protection that complements its other safety protocols, including a mask mandate during the fall term.

	The college noted it will allow for certain exemptions for medical conditions and religious beliefs, and may allow periodic testing for unvaccinated people who want to come to campus.

	ACC noted the policy requires approval from the board of governors.

	THE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF THE NORTH

	The University College of the North (UCN) released a statement on Thursday saying that students, staff, faculty, and visitors who intend to come to the campus must be vaccinated.

	UCN said its health protocols are ongoing, including masks on campus, physical distancing, and self-wellness checks. It noted that its shared space protocols will continue until at least the vaccine protocol takes effect at the end of October, but likely beyond that time as well. These protocols can be found online. https://ucncovid.ca/sharing-space-safely UCN will also be hosting on-campus vaccination clinics.

	The university said it will provide more information on the mandate in the coming days.

	CANADIAN MENNONITE UNIVERSITY

	The Canadian Mennonite University (CMU) said it is requiring staff, students, and faculty to be vaccinated against COVID-19. CMU added that those coming to campus this fall will need to attest to their COVID-19 vaccination status before Sept. 1 and may also need to show proof of vaccination.

	The university has set out the deadlines for vaccination requirements, which are Aug. 31 for first doses and Sept. 30 for second doses. The school will consider requests for exemptions consistent with the Human Rights Code of Manitoba.

	The CMU campus will be closed to guests for the fall term, except for anyone specifically invited to the campus. CommonWord and Folio Café in the Marpeck Commons will be open to the public in the fall.

	The university said it will help those who are not able to get a vaccination before coming to CMU in September with access to vaccines and will keep its mask protocols in place; however, it will re-evaluate these protocols every month. The university asks that people stay home when sick, sanitize their hands when going inside a building or classroom, and physically distance when possible.

	BRANDON UNIVERSITY

	Brandon University (BU) said it will implement a vaccine policy in the coming year.

	The university said most students, faculty, and staff are expected to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before its transition back to in-person learning. It added that it is not requiring vaccinations before the start of the fall term, which is only three weeks away, but it strongly encourages people to get vaccinated as soon as possible.

	BU said in the coming year, it will work towards having a campus that is as fully vaccinated as possible. Information on exact dates and other logistical issues, such as potential accommodations for those who can’t be vaccinated, will be worked out in the next few weeks and communicated as soon as possible.

	The university said its fall term will begin as planned, with masks required, physical distancing, enhanced cleaning, and in-person classes mostly limited to 25 students or less.

	BU is encouraging people to get vaccinated by offering prizes through the Winning Shot Initiative and hosting campus vaccine clinics from Sept. 7 to 9 at Harvest Hall.

       COVID-19 in Alberta: ICU, hospitalization numbers hit 7-week highs, 407 new casesAll students, staff of Calgary public school board required to wear masks at start of school yearRapid testing required at University of Calgary, University of Lethbridge for unvaccinated people accessing campus

	In studies, the two-dose COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were around 95 per cent effective at preventing illness, so while the vaccines are very good at protecting us from the virus, it's still possible to get infected with mild or no symptoms.

	Markland says vaccines aren’t fully effective against the highly-contagious Delta variant but are doing exactly what they should -- reducing severe illness or death.

	“If you are double vaccinated you may get this. In fact, Delta has optimized itself to be able to infect people who have their vaccines, but very few people have gotten very sick from it,"" he said.

	""And that’s because you already have defences in place to prevent the severity of illness that causes the catastrophic cascade of organ failure that we see with unprotected individuals.”

	Alberta’s COVID-19 hospitalization rate rose to a seven-week high Tuesday with 176 people in hospital and 44 of them in intensive care. Of those, 22 patients being treated in hospital have been fully-vaccinated meaning 87.5 per cent of all patients in hospital have not been fully-vaccinated.

	Active cases have seen a 900 per cent increase compared to a month ago, with 85 per cent of new infections among people who haven’t been fully-vaccinated

	The provincial government paused plans to eliminate remaining restrictions until at least Sept. 27 after an unexpected rise in hospitalizations and emerging data from the United States on pediatric cases linked to the highly contagious Delta variant.

	Markland worries about the increasing evidence suggesting the vaccines’ protective effect starts dropping within months and wants to see measures remain in place to avoid another uptick.  

	“If studies out of Israel are correct and immunity wanes, then there may need to be more shots and then people become fatigued with the idea of having to have regular boosters, and that then will lead to a rise in endemic infection again,” he said.

	""If we continue to take the easy road we’re going to be dealing with this for years to come so we need to take the vigor now and get it done properly.”

	This also comes as Alberta’s vaccination rate stagnates, with 76.9 per cent of eligible Albertans having received one dose and 68 per cent being fully vaccinated. All rapid-flow clinics in city centres in Alberta have closed within the last three weeks and the Calgary Zone no longer offers walk-in clinics.

	On Wednesday, Health Minister Tyler Shandro announced changes to Alberta’s Vaccine Awareness Program, which allows all Alberta doctors to submit claims and be compensated for any vaccine education or counselling they gave to patients via telephone or videoconference since May 1.

       Back-to-school: Calgary students on modified calendar return to class with mandated masks Masks mandatory in classrooms and labs at Mount Royal University in Calgary this fallProvince's back-to-school plan doesn't include masksRapid testing required at University of Calgary, University of Lethbridge for unvaccinated people accessing campus

	“We see this as a prudent approach to start up the school year to make sure that students again are in school in person,"" said Usih. ""We want our students to return. I want to do everything possible to ensure that their learning is not disrupted as a result of illness within our schools,”

	The decision was made after taking into account increasing COVID-19 case numbers, lower vaccination rates for those ages 12 to 19 and considering that those under 12 are not eligible to receive a vaccine.

	“At this time given that the vaccination rates for those 12 to 19 are just a little over 50 per cent …It’s really important that we take those extra precautions,"" Usih said.

	“This provides a greater level of confidence that we taking the extra step to ensure greater safety for all our students and staff, recognizing that health and safety is top priority,” Usih added.

	Plans are currently in place to extend the mask guidance of the 2020-2021 school year, including all outlined exceptions, into the start of 2021-2022 but the guidance document will be updated as necessary later this month.

	Usih said the mandated use of masks will be reviewed prior to the end of September. Any potential changes to the CBE rules will be made with consideration for active COVID-19 case counts in Calgary and Alberta as well as the direction of Alberta's chief medical officer of health and Alberta Education.

	HEALTH MEASURES

	CBE students in the modified calendar returned to class earlier this week with the mask requirement in place.

	Other health measures will include:

	-Students and staff will be expected to use a daily checklist to identify if they have COVID-19 symptoms and should stay home;

	-Enhanced cleaning and disinfection of high traffic/touch areas;

	-Enhanced ventilation in school;

	-Classroom cohorts in kindergarten to Grade 6; and

	-No unscheduled visitors or volunteers will be permitted in school at the start of the school year.

	The CBE said at the direction of the Chief Medical Officer of Health it will no longer inform close contacts of positive cases, but additional health measures may be implemented if outbreaks occur.

	The CBE will be lifting some measures including allowing band and sports activities and some field trips.

	The CBE continues to encourage all of its eligible employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

	The Saskatchewan NDP is joining calls to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for teachers and school staff around Saskatchewan by Oct. 1.

	It follows a similar call made by the Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation on Tuesday.

	NDP education critic Carla Beck said it’s one of several tools that need to be employed to protect those under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible for a vaccine.

You are now eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, according to Manitoba health

	“On September 1, the majority of people in elementary schools are going to be unvaccinated,” Beck said at a news conference Wednesday. “If we want those children to be in school without disruption and we want everyone in those buildings to be as safe as possible, we have to do everything we can.”

	Premier Scott Moe said Tuesday the province has not discussed mandating vaccines for education staff and other provincial employees to date but noted guidelines are likely forthcoming early next week for vaccine ineligible students.

	“We’re hopeful [children under 12] will be eligible later this calendar year,” Moe told reporters. “How do we ensure that as our kids head back to school this fall those that are ineligible for vaccines, [we] ensure that we’re providing the proper guidance for school divisions and for our families in the province.”

	The NDP also suggested Saskatchewan follow suit with other provinces like Manitoba and Alberta in expanding vaccine eligibility to all children born in 2009.

	Other pieces of a return-to-school plan the NDP would like to see include thresholds to trigger masking, testing and remote learning protocols, in-school vaccination clinics and clear direction and information from health officials.

	Some school divisions have released their respective individual plans, but the NDP said a lack of clear guidelines province-wide have created some inconsistencies.

	""The information has evolved, but it doesn't change from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in this province,"" Beck said. ""We need a plan, we need clarity.""

	The Saskatchewan School Boards Association (SSBA) said it encourages staff, parents and eligible students to get vaccinated but will leave any decisions on mandates to health officials.

	""We are relying on our medical professionals, our medical officials on that matter just like we have with all of the other COVID precautionary measures that have been put in place in schools all along,"" said Shawn Davidson, SSBA president.

	The Saskatchewan Medical Association (SMA) is urging school divisions to consider starting the year with COVID-19 restrictions like mask use in the classroom alongside vaccine mandates for everyone in the school system with Saskatchewan's active cases on the rise and the start of the school year only two weeks away.

	""With kids coming back to school, we know that there's increased risk for everybody and we just want to make sure we do it what we can to reduce the risk and the impact that this has on our society and our health systems,"" SMA president Dr. Eben Strydom said.

	Many Saskatchewan school divisions will welcome back students Sept. 1.

"With cases climbing sharply, Medicine Hat launches new COVID-19 vaccine campaign","Aug. 18, 2021 11:10 a.m. CST","
     
     LETHBRIDGE, Alta. - 
     
     As the pandemic's fourth wave gathers steam, Medicine Hat has seen a sharp rise in new COVID-19 infections, lending urgency to a new vaccination campaign launched by the city.  The city was up to 495 active cases today, almost double the active cases from a week ago. 
    Advertisement
     Medicine Hat is now home to the second-highest active case rate in the province, trailing only the Town of Banff.  The dramatic rise has not gone unnoticed by local leaders who have launched a new vaccination campaign.  “Ultimately it’s up to each one of us to get through this and really where that comes down to is vaccinations,"" said Merrick Brown, Medicine Hat's director of emergency management.  While the message is to encourage everyone to get vaccinated, there’s one group in particular the campaigns hopes to appeal to.  Brown said the main target is those aged between 20 and 40.    57 per cent of this age group are partially vaccinated while only 47 are fully vaccinated.  Those numbers are about 10 per cent lower than the provincial average.  Brown didn’t mince words, saying “Pretty simple solution to this: that age group needs to get vaccinated. Pretty simple, I don’t know how else to do it other than that.”  BILLBOARDS  The city will be putting up billboards across Medicine Hat urging everyone to get vaccinated in addition to promoting the message online.  The campaign is being support by the AHS.  Dr. Vivien Suttorp, the south zone medical officer of health, said that for case numbers to go down, residents of Medicine Hat will have to work together.  “There are a number of strategies that we can implement ourselves,"" she said. ""As families, as business owners, as school divisions, as municipalities and again, as we always say, we’re all in this together to stop and end this pandemic.”  Medicine Hat City Hall, August 17, 2021  In addition to encouraging vaccinations the city also reminded residents about other measures to stop the spread of COVID-19.  Things like staying home when sick, washing your hands often and coughing or sneezing into your arms can help limit the spread of COVID-19 and influenza.  But the main takeaway from today is the City of Medicine Hat wants to get more needles into arms.  “If you’re eligible and have not been immunized yet, please book your immunization appointment as soon as possible” said Brown.

     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	The Manitoba Liberals and NDP are calling for mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for people working in education, early learning and childcare.

	In a media availability Tuesday, Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont said with the onset of a potential fourth wave, now is the time to protect those who cannot be vaccinated.

	“Children can’t choose whether they are vaccinated or not, which means public health has an obligation to step up now to ensure that the adults who care for them don’t infect them with COVID,” said Lamont.

	Lamont said of the approximately 400,000 Manitobans that have yet to receive their shots, many of them are children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible.

	He said by mandating vaccinations, schools would be safer for both staff and students.

	“This is not about what we want, this is about what we need to do. It’s about what we need to do to protect children, to protect our health-care system, and in fact to minimize a fourth wave in Manitoba,” said Lamont.

	In a statement Nello Altomare, Manitoba’s NDP Critic for Education, said parents need to know the government is doing everything possible to protect kids when they return to the classroom.

	“That’s why public health must make COVID vaccines mandatory for all staff in schools and childcare centres, and make accommodations for workers who have legitimate reasons not to be vaccinated,"" Altomare said in a statement.

	MANITOBA TEACHERS’ SOCIETY ECHOES VACCINATION MANDATE

	The Manitoba Teachers’ Society (MTS) echoed the calls for mandatory vaccinations for education workers.

	A motion passed Tuesday by the MTS provincial executive calls on the provincial government to require all public school employees to be fully vaccinated. The motion does allow for exemptions based on religious or medical reasons.

	MTS President James Bedford said Manitoba’s recently announced back to school plan didn’t contain the safety measures that the society’s members were looking for.

	“We’re on the cusp of a fourth wave, perhaps we’re into a fourth wave, and the delta variant is the most common one now in the province. The impacts on younger people, the rate of spread among younger people, this has our members very concerned,” said Bedford.

	He said vaccinations will be key in limiting the spread of the virus and keeping those unable to be vaccinated safe.

	“We have the responsibility to look after the safety of those students who are in our care and concern, and this is one those ways we can be looking after their safety in a very proactive way because remember, almost half of our students, those under the age of 12, don’t have vaccination as an option,” said Bedford.

	Specific data on vaccination rates among education staff is unavailable, but Bedford believes the rates among members would be similar to those of the general population.

	The province recently announced changes to youth vaccination eligibility by using birth year instead of birth month. That means any child turning 12 this year is eligible for a vaccine, regardless of their birthday.

	Dr. Joss Reimer, the medical lead of Manitoba's Vaccine Implementation Task Force, has said the province is seriously considering a school-based immunization rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine for young students once Health Canada approves vaccines for children under 12.

	For now, only children between the ages of 12 and 17 can roll up their sleeves for a Pfizer shot in Canada.

	""It's about time, it's been a lot of back-and-forth but obviously we're excited for Amelia to have the opportunity to be vaccinated before heading back into school,"" said Amelia's mother, Elaine Fischer.

	""It gives me a bit more peace that she can sustain going to school and stay healthy.""

	On Tuesday, Ontario's chief medical officer of health Dr. Kieran Moore also announced vaccine policies for high-risk settings, including education workers.

	While vaccination won't be mandatory, those who decline vaccination must undertake regular COVID-19 testing.

	""We must take assertive action to protect the health of all Ontarians,"" Dr. Moore said Tuesday. ""The policies I am announcing today are an important link in the chain of protection that will help keep Ontario strong in the face of the fourth wave.""

	The new vaccination policies must be implemented no later than Sept. 7.

	School boards in the Waterloo Region did not immediately have details available about how these policies would impact local schools.

	""We will be supporting the request of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and trust that it will allow our staff and students to return with a higher level of confidence and a higher degree of safety for all,"" Waterloo Catholic District School Board education director Loretta Notten said in an email.

	""We are awaiting the policy from the ministry of education and will be able to provide details in the coming days,"" Laura Booth, a spokesperson for the Waterloo Region District School Board, said in an email.

	Teachers' unions say they're also left waiting for more information.

	""We have yet to hear this translated into direction and policy from the Ministry,"" said Rob Gascho with Waterloo Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation.

	""There are people that can't get vaccinated or won't get vaccinated and what are we going to do with those people,"" said Patrick Etmanski with Waterloo Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association.

	Meanwhile, the union representing elementary teachers remains concerned not just for its members, but for the younger children who still aren't eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine.

	""The reality is we still want to see smaller classroom sizes, we still want to see ventilation to improve and we want to see rapid testing for those who may be unvaccinated but also for students to ensure that when they're coming into the buildings in September everybody is protected and safe,"" said Jeff Pelic with Waterloo Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario.

	The Region of Waterloo confirmed all children born in 2009 would be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine beginning Aug. 18. Vaccination clinics across the region are accepting walk-ins.

	“This morning we’re here to celebrate those who have done their part by getting vaccinated,” Atwal said.

	The Vax to Win lottery is one of Manitoba’s incentives to encourage people to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

	All Manitobans aged 12 years of age and older who received one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on or before Aug. 2 were entered into the August draw.

	The province will be holding a second lottery next month for all eligible Manitobans who received both doses of the vaccine on or before Sept. 6. Winners will be announced later in September.

	Prizes for the September lottery also include three $100,000 prizes in the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority; one $100,000 prize in each of the remaining health authorities; and 10 $25,000 scholarships for youth aged 12 to 17.

	Manitobans are automatically entered into the lottery, but can choose to opt-out.

	Wharton took the opportunity at Tuesday’s news conference to thank everyone who has gotten vaccinated so far.

	“We all need to protect one and other right now and getting your vaccine is the best way to do that,” the minister said.

	“As more and more Manitobans roll up their sleeves, we are continuously moving closer to our September 6 reopening target. We have hit our first milestone of 80 per cent of all eligible Manitobans aged 12 and up vaccinated with one dose. And right now, we sit at 74.3 per cent of those who have received both doses. Our goal, of course, is 75 per cent.”

    Advertisement

	The university said it has continued to implement “robust health and safety protocols” as per the advice of health authorities and has been working closely with the Windsor Essex County Health Unit “who fully endorse this action.”

	The University of Windsor is offering four different modes of course delivery this fall: face-to-face, hybrid, hy-flex and online, and announced on Thursday student athletes and student athletic therapists would be required to be vaccinated before returning to campus but extended the policy to include all on-campus the next day.

	UWindsor said the addition to its vaccination policy came following discussions surrounding the ongoing risks of COVID-19 including concerns of a fourth wave and emerging variants and regional vaccination rates.

	For anyone who will be on campus, at least a first dose of a Health-Canada approved COVID-19 vaccine will be required by Sept. 1 and a second dose by Oct. 1.

	Those who do not have at least their first dose by that time will be subject to regular testing protocols to access campus.

	Accommodations can be requested for vaccination exemptions for medical reasons under grounds protected by the Ontario Human Rights Code, the school said.

	Regular testing protocols will be established for those who are not vaccinated and have received accommodations.

	Vaccine appointments are available locally by visiting the Windsor Essex County Health Unit’s website. For student athletes located outside of the region, information about booking a vaccine appointment can be found by visiting Ontario’s COVID-19 vaccine website.

	A COVID-19 vaccine pop-up clinic on UWindsor’s campus is planned for Friday, Sept. 10 for all students, faculty, staff and members of the community to attend.

	""When you make the choice to get vaccinated, you're protecting yourself and your loved ones and you're also protecting our community,"" Redman said.

	'LAST MILE' OF VACCINE ROLLOUT

	Vickie Murray with the region's COVID-19 vaccine task force said the region is now moving into the final stage of vaccine rollout, called the ""Last Mile"" by the province.

	""The work we're doing during the 'Last Mile' is to continue to do outreach and increase our vaccination rates so that we can meet and exceed the provincial targets,"" Murray said.

	Moving forward, the region's vaccination dashboard will only update Monday to Friday.

	Murray said 40,000 to 50,000 people still need to receive a second dose, and around 35,000 of those people are eligible since 28 days have passed since their first dose.

	""We've been reaching out to these people via multiple emails and texts and we are now calling people who have not yet gotten that second dose to encourage them to get that dose as soon as possible,"" Murray said.

	She added many people who they speak to will go to a clinic that afternoon to get a vaccine dose.

	All regional clinics continue to offer walk-ins for first and second doses. As of Sept. 7, regional clinics will move away from appointments and offer doses through walk-ins only.

	There are plans to add vaccine clinics at local shopping malls to encourage people to get a vaccine while completing their back-to-school shopping.

	Mobile vaccine buses continue to operate in communities throughout Waterloo Region. Murray said last week, one bus administered 85 per cent first doses.

	""It is important to acknowledge that even as we reach the provincial vaccine targets and celebrate key milestones, the Delta variant is increasing across the province,"" Murray said. ""We need to keep our foot on the pedal and keep working to get more people vaccinated.""

	HOME-BASED VACCINATIONS

	Murray said the task force continues to work to reach people who may not be able to get a vaccine through clinics, pharmacies or primary care.

	Starting Monday, the region will expand criteria for people to receive home-based vaccinations. The expansion will include people who can't leave their home due to physical limitations or health issues, people who missed opportunities for mobile vaccines in their community, people with transportation challenges, people who live remotely and people who need privacy or discretion for immunization.

	People will be able to apply for home-based vaccinations through the region's website or by calling the region's service line.

	CASE RATES REMAIN STABLE

	Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang said Waterloo Region's case rates remain relatively stable at this time.

	The incidence rate currently sits at 21 cases per 100,000 people per week.

	There is a current COVID-19 outbreak at Nazarene Christian Congregation in Kitchener. There are 25 cases currently linked to that outbreak, and Dr. Wang said there are likely more. Anyone who attended a service on Aug. 1 is considered a high-risk contact and should self-isolate and seek testing.

	Dr Wang continued to encourage people get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible.

	""Getting the vaccine is your best defence against COVID-19,"" she said. ""It greatly reduces your risk for serious outcomes.""

	She added that people are eight times more likely to test positive for the disease in Ontario if they aren't vaccinated.

	The Delta variant continues to circulate in the community, Dr. Wang said. She adds that people should continue to follow public health guidelines like masking and distancing to prevent further spread.

'It’s worrisome going into a fourth wave': WECHU on local vaccine rates,"Aug. 14, 2021 7:37 a.m. CST","
     
     Windsor, Ont. - 
     
    
	The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit continues to urge local residents to get their COVID-19 vaccine as cases continue to rise.

	The Health Unit says, on a daily basis, 340 residents are receiving their first jab across Windsor-Essex.

	“I think we all thought we would have been much more farther ahead as far of the number of individuals who have had at least their first dose but definitely fully vaccinated given the capacity in our community and supply,” said Nicole Dupuis, Chief Executive Officer, Friday.

	In total, 77.1% of WEC residents 12 years and older have received at least one dose while 69.2% of WEC residents 12 years and older are fully vaccinated.

	Local Health officials confirm the majority of new cases are among the unvaccinated.

	“We are seeing more people go into public settings whether it’s restaurants, gyms,” says Ramsey D'Souza, manager of epidemiology. “Once people contract the virus, they bring it home which then spreads to family members who aren’t fully vaccinated.”

	Dupuis reminds Canadians that both vaccination and good adherence to public safety measures is what will help us get through the fourth wave.

	Public safety measures aren’t being followed strongly,” she adds. “Social distancing and masking remains an issue.”

	The push to get Nova Scotians vaccinated continues but the amount of vaccine going into arms across the province is slowing down.

	""It's kind of the same thing that we saw at the tail end of the push to get the first doses out the door is that you do eventually just run out of people who are very eager to go get their second dose,"" said epidemiologist Kevin Wilson.

	""The initial wave of the vaccine rollout was really effective and it reached the people who wanted to get vaccines and had few barriers and it did it really quickly,"" said Chris Parsons, with the Nova Scotia Health Coalition.

	As of Wednesday, 1,403,617 doses of vaccine had been administered in Nova Scotia, 657,205 of them were second doses.

	In order for the province to move into the final phase of its reopening plan and remove more pandemic restrictions, 75 per cent of the population needs to be fully vaccinated. As of Monday, there were approximately 26,000 appointments booked after Sept. 1 that could be moved up into August.

	""We really should be seeing Public Health culling through all those people who have not gotten a second dose and figuring out what those barriers are, are they transportation barriers, are they information barriers, is it simply the fact that they don't know they can move it up,"" said Parsons.

	With the new school year fast approaching, a letter from the province's top doctor was shared yesterday online.

	In the letter, Dr. Robert Strang strongly encouraged parents with children 12 and over who haven't yet had their first or second dose of vaccine to make an appointment, saying: ""We all need two doses of the vaccine to be fully protected and it takes two weeks after your second dose to have full immunity.""

	According to data from the Nova Scotia government, as of Aug. 6, 20 per cent of youth aged 12 to 14 have had one shot of vaccine, while 59 have had both doses.

	Meantime, 15 per cent of those aged 15 to 19 are partially vaccinated with one dose of vaccine and 57 per cent are fully vaccinated.

	""There has been concern expressed by Public Health about the slow uptake in the 12 to 18 age group. There's still a significant number of children in that age bracket that have not been vaccinated that can be vaccinated,"" said Paul Wozney, president of the Nova Scotia Teachers Union. ""So that means that well over half the student population in Nova Scotia is heading back to class in a few weeks without vaccine.""

	In New Brunswick, health officials are asking parents and guardians to ensure children 12 and older get vaccinations. On Thursday, the province said more than 11,000 New Brunswickers between the ages of 12 and 19 are not yet fully vaccinated and another roughly 19,000 have yet to receive their first doses.

	Back in Nova Scotia, while the province continues its vaccine rollout, Parsons says there still hasn't been a robust campaign to fight vaccine hesitancy in Nova Scotia.

	""I do think that some of the things that have happened, the fact that we are doing vaccine mixing, which many countries are not, the fact that there was very contradictory information and guidance about AstraZeneca that these things have led people that otherwise might not be hesitant to get the vaccine to think twice,"" said Parsons.

	Lancer student athletes and student therapists will be required to have their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by no later than Aug. 31, 2021. Their second dose will be required no later than Oct. 1, 2021.

	“As we continue to navigate this pandemic and move closer towards a return to varsity competition, it is critical that we do so with the health and safety of everyone at the top of our minds,” said Mike Havey, director of athletics. “By requiring vaccinations for our student athletes and student therapists, we believe we will be better positioned to return to competition in a safer fashion this fall.”

	Student athletes and student therapists will be required to provide proof of their vaccination status (first or second dose) by Aug. 31.

	Provisions have been put in place for vaccination exemptions for medical reasons or under grounds protected under the Human Rights Code.

	The Department of Athletics will also be implementing rapid testing beginning in September for those student athletes and student therapists who are not yet fully vaccinated or who have a vaccination exemption from the University.

	“The University of Windsor encourages individuals to speak to their health care provider and consider getting vaccinated against COVID-19 to reduce the likelihood of serious illness and for the health and safety of the community,” states a news release from the university.

	Vaccine appointments are available locally by visiting the Windsor Essex County Health Unit’s website. For student athletes located outside of the region, information about booking a vaccine appointment can be found by visiting Ontario’s COVID-19 vaccine website.

	MLHU Medical Officer of Health Dr. Chris Mackie had said in a statement, “We continue to look forward to being able to administer the vaccine to children and to protect them from COVID-19 and the Delta variant, but in the meantime, we are excited to be able to offer the Pfizer vaccine now to youth born in 2009...By extending vaccination to this group, we will be able to bolster our efforts to protect as many school-aged children as we can as they return to the classroom in September.”

	Public health says three cases are contacts of previously confirmed cases and six cases are under investigation.

	As of Thursday, 54 of the province's 68 cases were identified in the Moncton region.

	Two cases were identified in the Saint John region (Zone 2). Both involve people in their 40s and are travel related.

	There are currently no hospitalizations in New Brunswick due to COVID-19.

	VACCINE UPDATE

	New Brunswick health officials are urging children 12 to 19 to get vaccinated, as back-to-school approaches. 

	According to the province, more than 11,000 New Brunswickers between the ages of 12 and 19 are not yet fully vaccinated and another roughly 19,000 have yet to receive their first doses.

	“With students going back to school on Sept. 7, and a two-week timespan needed after your second dose to have full immunity, parents and guardians need to book an appointment immediately to get their children fully vaccinated, or receive at least the first dose, if they have not yet done so,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health in a news release.

	“We all need two doses of the vaccine to be fully protected.”

	Here is the current vaccination breakdown of New Brunswickers aged 12-19:

	
		 Fully vaccinated: 54.04 per cent (34,968 people)
	
		 Received only first dose: 16.6 per cent (11,511 people)
	
		 Not vaccinated: 29.36 per cent (18,998 people)


	“We are finalizing guidelines for the 2021-22 school year and will share them with students, families, teachers and staff by the end of next week,” said Education and Early Childhood Development Minister Dominic Cardy.

	“We are looking at the evolving science, and our success during the last school year, so we can keep our schools as healthy and safe as possible. Our goal is as close to a normal year as possible in the face of challenges from the Delta variant, while we protect those who cannot be vaccinated and those under 12 still waiting for vaccines to be approved. A safe return to school means a vaccinated province. Please help our students; please get your COVID vaccine today.""

	As of Thursday, 70.5 per cent of New Brunswickers age 12 and older are fully vaccinated and 83.1 per cent have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

	In total, 1,064,911 vaccine doses have been administered in New Brunswick.

	If you have not yet had your first or second dose, you are encouraged to go to a mobile or walk-in clinic or to book an appointment through a participating pharmacy or at a Vitalité or Horizon Health Network clinic.

	All eligible New Brunswickers can book their second dose appointments now for a date that is at least 28 days after their first dose.

	If you have an appointment for a vaccine but were able to get vaccinated sooner elsewhere, please be sure to contact your pharmacy or regional health authority clinic to cancel the appointment you no longer need. This will help ensure that someone else in your community can obtain their vaccination sooner.

	COVID-19 CASE DATA

	New Brunswick has had 2,471 cumulative cases of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.

	In total, 2,356 people have recovered, and 46 people have died in the province from COVID-19.

	Public health says 933 tests were completed in New Brunswick on Tuesday. A total of 390,197 tests have been processed since the start of the pandemic.

	The number of cases are broken down by New Brunswick’s seven health zones:

	
		Zone 1 – Moncton region: 582 confirmed cases (54 active cases)

	Laurentian University is making COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for students living in residence and anyone taking part in varsity athletics.

	School officials say the decision is being made to prioritize health and safety, low vaccination rates for people aged 18-29 in our region, and the delta variant.

	Students living in L.U. residences and everyone involved in varsity athletics will be required to have at least one dose of the vaccine by Sept. 4 and a second dose by Oct.15.

	All students, staff and faculty at Western University will be required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination or get tested twice a week to be on campus this fall.

	“The health and safety of our community is our top priority – and it’s a shared effort,” said Sarah Prichard, acting provost and vice-president (academic) in a statement. “Vaccination is our clearest path to a safe campus.”

	The university says the decision was made after careful consultation with public health partners and faculty experts in medicine, law and ethics.

	A vaccine requirement had already been introduced for students living in residence, which is also being expanded.

	Now, students involved in work and clinical placements, music programs, or varsity athletics (along with coaches and team staff) will also be required to be vaccinated.

	Exemptions will be made on grounds protected by the Ontario Human Rights Code, the university said.

	Dr. Chris Mackie, medical officer of health for the Middlesex-London Health Unit, endorsed the plan.

	Speaking to CTV News London, he called the development ""tremendous"" and said it positions the university as a leader among post-secondary institutions in Canada.

	“We know that post-secondary has the potential to be a major driver of COVID cases and pandemic waves...To see Western come down on the right side of history by doing whatever they can to prevent spread in post-secondary students, it’s a tremendous win for our community.”

	Nigmendra Narain, president of the University of Western Ontario Faculty Association (UWOFA), believes some of the credit for the decision goes to the union's stance.

	“This change would have been unimaginable without the advocacy efforts of our members over the three weeks. That includes faculty members, librarians, archivists sending emails to their deans, to the administration, copying us and UWOFA on it.”

	He says it has been the ""single biggest groundswell of member activity to push university policy"" in his time at the association.

	According to the university, a recent survey sent to 62,000 students, faculty and staff found nearly 90 per cent of respondents reported being fully vaccinated, while another five per cent plan to get vaccinated by September. The survey had a response rate of roughly 50 per cent.

	“We are optimistic that in providing our campus community with the education and supports they need, we will increase vaccination rates even further,” Prichard added.

	Masks will continue to be required for all indoor activities, and officials say enhanced cleaning and health screening is being implemented while ventilation systems are being assessed.

	To date, only a handful of post-secondary institutions have announced blanket vaccine mandates, including Seneca College, the University of Ottawa and the University of Waterloo.

     Edmonton - 
     
    
	The number of patients in Alberta hospitals and intensive care units continued to grow on Wednesday as the province reported 138 coronavirus patients in hospital, including 31 in ICU.

	The province has had over 100 COVID-19 patients in hospital every day since Aug. 3 and more than 20 patients in intensive care since the start of the month.

	The 31 patients in ICU is the highest count in nearly a month, since July 13. The 138 in hospital represents an increase of two over the day before, pending future data adjustments.

	Alberta reported 501 new cases Wednesday as active cases rose for a 25th consecutive day, up to 3,769 -- about where the active case count was the second week of June.

	There was one new death due to COVID-19 reported, bringing the province's death toll to 2,331.

	Among eligible Albertans, 76.5 per cent have received a first dose of vaccine and 67.2 per cent have had two doses.

	The province reported a 5.31 per cent test positivity rate on about 8,600 tests. 

	Alberta is ending routine COVID-19 testing next week, with testing no longer recommended for those with symptoms unless the result is needed to direct future care. 

	In addition, the province's testing facilities will close down at the end of the month, leaving primary care settings such as hospitals and doctor's offices as the main venues for testing. 

	Alberta has already closed routine testing to asymptomatic individuals including close contacts to those who test positive.

	Those limits on testing mean the daily case counts will lose much of their meaning without routine screening. 

	The next data update is scheduled for Thursday afternoon.

Saskatoon's synchrotron helping scientists develop antiviral drug for COVID-19 ,"Aug. 12, 2021 9:23 a.m. CST","

	Scientists from the University of Alberta and Saskatoon are using the city’s Canadian Light Source to develop antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19.

	The team found inhibitors that target a protein called a protease, which is used by the novel coronavirus to make more copies of itself.

       COVID-19 active cases up 71% in Sask. 1 month after restrictions were liftedMore than 20 million COVID-19 vaccine doses now stockpiled in Canadian freezers

	Saskatoon researcher Kathryn Janzen compares this to a superhero losing its power.

	Working remotely from Edmonton, Joanne Lemieux, U of A professor in the department of biochemistry, grew crystals of the SARS-CoV-2 protein and then used the synchrotron to obtain a three-dimensional picture of it.

	With that image, researchers examined what proteins could fit together, like a lock and key, Janzen said.

	“You can see at the different shapes and binding sites that they might be able to use to target a protease protein of the disease,” she said.

	While SARS-CoV-2 and its cousins SARS and MERS cause serious respiratory diseases, coronaviruses are also responsible for a wide range of illnesses in humans and animals.

	Lemieux said the proteases are similar among the different coronaviruses and that any antiviral s developed for one coronavirus would likely treat a variety of coronavirus infections, including those found in animals.

	Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company behind a successful mRNA vaccine, is moving its own antivirals to stage one clinical trials.

	Lemieux said this is a sign that her group has been headed in the right direction.

	“This would enable ease of accessibility for people around the world, especially in regions or populations where vaccines are not an option,” she said.

	A surge of COVID-19 cases in the Central Okanagan has forced some elective surgeries to be rescheduled, and experts are warning that other hospitals could see the same thing if a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases continue.

	Interior Health says Kelowna General Hospital is seeing a high number of COVID-19 positive patients due to the outbreak in the region.

	“Affected patients are being notified directly to reschedule their procedure.”

	B.C.’s top doctor adds COVID infections are causing staffing issues at the hospital.

	“There have been a number of healthcare workers who have been affected by COVID, and that has put additional challenges particularly on Kelowna General Hospital,” says Dr. Bonnie Henry.

	A group of independent COVID-19 modellers suggest more hospitals could soon be overwhelmed by an influx of COVID-19 patients, if cases don’t start coming down.

	“There are unfortunately enough people who are not protected by vaccination, that if COVID continues to spread among them, with the occasional breakthrough infection, then yes, we could overwhelm our healthcare system again,” says Caroline Colijn, infectious disease modeller and Simon Fraser University math professor.

	Colijn says the central Okanagan is not the only part of B.C. seeing rising case numbers.

	“We’re actually seeing growth across B.C.”

	According to data from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, cases are climbing in each of the province’s health authorities. Seventy-two per cent of eligible British Columbians are fully vaccinated, however researchers say that’s not good enough to stop the spread of the more easily transmissible Delta variant.

	“If I had to pick a number I would say we should be getting 90 per cent of people who are eligible vaccinated,” says Colijn.

	Data from Colijn and her fellow COVID-19 modellers suggest the province could record more than 1,000 new daily cases by September. If so, researchers say more hospitals would be strained.

	She says the best way to prevent that is to get more British Columbians vaccinated, which involves an approved vaccine for children under 12 years old.

Behind the decision by businesses to require proof of vaccination,"Aug. 11, 2021 10:08 p.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	An Edmonton restaurant is requiring patrons be double vaccinated in order to dine indoors, something experts say falls in a somewhat legal grey area.

	Since the provincial mask mandate in Alberta lifted on July 1, business were left to decide whether patrons had to continue wearing masks inside or not.

    Advertisement
    
	One restaurant, Fleisch, has announced it will require customers to have two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine if they want to dine inside the restaurant.

	Fleisch management declined to comment for this story, but in the announcement called the decision an ""easy"" one, noting, ""Community > everything.""

	

	

	“If that’s their prerogative then, by all means, we support any business and their choice to do so,” said Ernie Tsu, the president of the Alberta Hospitality Association.

	The decision on whether businesses can legally require proof of vaccination is a grey area, according to experts.

	“It really depends on the type of business… it could be contrary to certain pieces of legislation and certain considerations that are in place,” said Lauren Chalaturnyk, an associate lawyer.

	“Businesses do need to be quite careful that they’re balancing (health and safety) obligations with privacy and human rights considerations.”

	Private businesses are able to decide who they provide services to and who they don’t, but they can’t discriminate on the basis of something protected in the Alberta Human Rights Act, according to Chalaturnyk.

	Religion, physical and mental disabilities are covered in the act, things that might prevent someone from getting vaccinated.

	“Human rights law requires that those businesses accommodate individuals who can’t get vaccinated due to, for example, health reasons,” said Dr. Lorian Hardcastle, an associate professor with the faculty of law at the University of Calgary.

	“We don’t know, yet, what reasonable accommodation of those who cannot get vaccinated will look like.”

		COVID-19 in Alberta: Hospitalizations up nearly 50 per cent since start of the month


	The Human Rights Act doesn't protect people who simply don't want to get vaccinated, added to Hardcastle.

	When the mask mandate ended on Canada Day, a provincial human rights tribunal issued guidance for businesses. Further guidance on businesses requiring proof of vaccination is something experts are hoping for.

	“I hope we do see guidance, it is certainly possible that allowing people to dine outside over inside would be viewed as a reasonable accommodation,” said Hardcastle.

	In addition to human rights concerns, there could also be privacy concerns depending on how information on proof of vaccination is taken.

	“If a record is being provided, then you’re holding onto personal information, and it’s personal health information, which has some pretty stringent requirements attached to it in terms of how it’s collected, used, disclosed,” said Chalaturnyk.

	If businesses require being shown a record of vaccination, but don’t record the information, “there isn’t that same risk of having those same records disclosed or having that data accessed,” according to Hardcastle.

	If a business is found to be in violation of the Human Rights Act, there could be a financial impact.

	“It’s very dependent on the impact on the complainant and the response that the business is able to give that would determine how significant that financial impact could be,” said Chalaturnyk.

	“The Alberta Human Rights Commission can also issue some very unique remedies like requiring a business to put in a non-discrimination policy, or require their employees to do something akin to sensitivity training.”

	The financial penalty can range from a couple thousand dollars to $25,000, added Chalaturnyk.

	“We would recommend seeking out some legal advice to make sure that all of those considerations are being properly balanced before going down that path,” said Chalaturnyk.

	“We’re really going to have to see the cases play out, and in some ways that’s what makes it hard to be those pioneering businesses passing these requirements,” said Hardcastle.

	Those numbers are now down to just 400 per week.

	“We are watching the September potential blip closely to make sure we can adjust our operations to accommodate,” Moore said.

	As students get ready to head back to the classroom, Associate Medical Health Officer for the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit, Dr. Colin Lee says, a fourth wave is inevitable.

	He says protection against the delta variant requires at least 90 per cent of the population vaccinated.

	“That’s just not going to happen because our under 12’s have not been approved for a vaccine for at least an x number of weeks or potentially months,” Lee said.

	Lee adds the goal is to get as many eligible people vaccinated as possible, combined with current public health measures.

	“Since June of this year, approximately 95 percent of our cases are either not fully immunized or not immunized at all,” Lee said.

	Right now, 70 per cent of people 12 to 17 years old have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

	At the same time, since February, young adults between 18 and 34 continue to have the highest rates of infection.

	“Ultimately, we have to figure out what it is that we can do to encourage them to be immunized and what we are doing to potentially discourage them from not being immunized,” Lee said.

	Moving forward, the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit will emphasize pop-up clinics at places like beaches, parks and farmer’s markets.

	“Those who would want to and can access our regular clinics have had lots of opportunity to do it; we do need to get to our harder to reach population,” Lee said.

	As for schools, Lee says there are plans to include pop-up clinics there as well, although those details are still being worked out.

"'Quite complex, but really successful': SHA reflects on drive-thru and mass vaccination clinics as it shifts to targeted strategy","Aug. 11, 2021 8:53 a.m. CST","
     
     REGINA - 
     
    
	The Saskatchewan Health Authority is calling its drive-thru and mass vaccination clinics a success as it shifts the vaccination strategy towards outreach.

	The first drive-thru vaccination site opened at Regina’s Evraz Place in mid-march as a pilot project. The concept combined the modelling of testing drive-thru sites, with the SHA’s influenza and other vaccination campaigns.

	“It was really quite complex, but really successful, the model,” said Sheila Anderson, the SHA’s vaccine chief for the emergency operations centre.

	At one point, there were 20 drive-thru sites across the province, with the largest being in Regina and Saskatoon. Anderson said each site required considerations on managing and transporting the vaccine, safety protocols, staffing, traffic flow and waiting areas.

	“Another part of what we did was also the digital health support and the IT support we needed, so we could do real-time data entry into our vaccination programs to ensure we were documenting in real time,” she said.

	In total, the SHA delivered more than 260,000 vaccines through drive-thru clinics and almost 585,000 through booked appointments at mass immunization sites.

	Dr. Joseph Blondeau, head of clinical microbiology at Royal University Hospital and the University of Saskatchewan, said these sites were successful thanks to the hard work of the vaccine teams.

	“With over a million people in the province, that was an enormous effort, in a relatively short period of time,” Dr. Blondeau said. “I think we have to be proud of all of those accomplishments.”

	However, the SHA is shifting away from these kinds of vaccine clinics, as demand for the vaccine has changed, and the number of people booking appointments has slowed.

	“Now we’re doing more of outreach clinics, so we’re taking vaccine out to where people live work and play,” said Anderson.

	Going forward, COVID-19 shots will be available across the province at walk-in and pop-up clinics and by appointment at participating pharmacies. Appointments booked online will still be available in small centres that don’t have access to a pharmacy.

	Dr. Blondeau said he agrees with the SHA’s decision to shift strategy.

	“It’s a tremendous amount of resources that are required to have people sitting and waiting all day for people to come in and get vaccinated. And if people aren’t utilizing that, I think that that resource needs to be spent differently.”

	Anderson said the SHA is worried about vaccination rates, and is expecting to see an increase in COVID-19 cases in the fall.

	“We’re expecting it to be in younger populations, that’s where we have less people vaccinated. Even starting to see in other jurisdictions, where kids are starting to be impacted more by COVID,” said Anderson.

"COVID-19 cases among children, teens rising in Waterloo Region","Aug. 11, 2021 7:14 a.m. CST","
     
     Waterloo - 
     
    
	More than half of the new COVID-19 cases reported in Waterloo Region on Tuesday were in children, with 25 per cent in kids nine and younger.

	In Tuesday's update, health officials reported 20 new COVID-19 cases. Of those, eight are in youth between the ages of 10 and 19, with five cases in children nine and younger.

	""It's really not a surprise that you are seeing cases in the younger generation,"" said Ryan Imgrund, a biostatistician who works with several public health units in Ontario.

	""As we get more and more people vaccinated, especially those that are vaccine eligible, the 12 and over population, what's going to happen is that cases link into the under 12 population.""

	Health officials in Waterloo Region say the new cases among youth and teens highlight the importance of everyone getting vaccinated.

	""It is important that everyone who is eligible get vaccinated as soon as they can because children under 12 are not yet eligible,"" a spokesperson for the region said in an email.

	With the start of school only four weeks away, the province's top doctor says COVID-19 cases will go up in the fall, with how high they soar depending on each community's vaccination rate.

	""We do anticipate that there are different regions affected given that Ontario has different immunization rates, some communities are achieving very, very high protection and may be spared any significant rise in cases,"" Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said at a press conference Tuesday.

	In Waterloo Region, more than 83.8 per cent of residents 12 and older have received at least one dose, while 73.91 per cent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated.

	Children under 12 are still not eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. In Waterloo Region, that's about 82,000 people.

	Although children will be required to wear masks when they return to school, some are concerned there's no plan released by the province yet on how to handle COVID-19 cases in the classroom.

	""The most important stuff, which is on contact tracing and case management, we don't have that information yet and we're only a few weeks away from school,"" Imgrund said.

	Alberta has already closed routine testing to asymptomatic individuals such as close contacts to those who test positive.

	The limits on testing mean the daily case counts will lose much of their meaning without routine screening.

	British Columbia has recorded another 395 cases of COVID-19, health officials said Tuesday after acknowledging that climbing hospitalization numbers have delayed some elective surgeries.

	The latest infections, announced in a written statement from the Ministry of Health, increased the province's seven-day average for new cases to 383 per day, the highest it's been since May 24.

	About 47 per cent of the new cases came from B.C.'s Interior Health region, which has been experiencing a localized surge in transmission that prompted officials to re-impose a mask mandate and several other restrictions in the Central Okanagan.

	Earlier on Tuesday, Interior Health confirmed that the high number of COVID-19 cases at Kelowna General Hospital has forced some elective surgeries to be delayed.

	""Some elective surgeries have been rescheduled to manage capacity at the hospital. Affected patients are being notified directly to reschedule their procedure,"" the health authority said in a statement.

	Interior Health said the majority of hospitalized coronavirus patients are ""young adults who are not fully immunized.""

	B.C. decreased the minimum interval between vaccine doses to 28 days this week as part of a push to get more residents vaccinated as quickly as possible to curb the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.

	Vaccine clinics across the province are also allowing people to get a first dose without an appointment.

	As of Tuesday, B.C. has administered 7,087,736 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, including enough first shots for 82.1 per cent of the eligible population age 12 and older.

	Nearly 71 per cent of the eligible population has received both shots.

	Officials had no coronavirus-related deaths to announce on Tuesday, leaving the province's death toll at 1,777. Five deaths were recorded over the weekend, matching the number suffered across B.C. in the preceding 14 days combined.

Political experts say 'fluid' N.S. election campaign could bring surprises next week,"Aug. 12, 2021 7:46 a.m. CST","
     
     HALIFAX - 
     
    
	As Nova Scotia's election campaign winds through its final week, political observers say there could be a number of surprises at the polls next Tuesday.

	While he isn't predicting any outcomes, Tom Urbaniak, a political scientist at Cape Breton University, says the situation is ""quite fluid"" for the three main political parties and their leaders -- Iain Rankin of the Liberals, Tim Houston of the Progressive Conservatives and Gary Burrill of the NDP.

    Advertisement
    
	With 13 incumbent candidates not running in this election -- including 11 Liberals -- Urbaniak says that makes the outcomes less certain in a number of the province's 55 ridings.

	""Where an incumbent is not reoffering, that's where the races become interesting,"" Urbaniak said. ""I think there will be a few surprises on election night.""

	Lori Turnbull, a political scientist at Dalhousie University, says there is more potential for volatility among the electorate compared to the last election because of the addition of four ridings. Preston, east of Halifax, was restored to its position as a protected riding in 2019 along with three other largely Acadian ridings after the four districts were eliminated in 2012.

	""It does open things up and then it becomes a bit more of a question of what's going on in a riding and what's going on in the election overall,"" Turnbull said.

	Urbaniak said he wonders whether the Liberals are starting to show some signs of worry. He pointed to an unexpected policy announcement on Monday about COVID-19 vaccination passports by Rankin, which smacked of ""some improvisation.""

	Urbaniak noted that vaccine passports were not part of the Liberal platform and that Rankin, like the other party leaders, passed on an opportunity to talk about policy related to the novel coronavirus during a televised roundtable debate last Thursday.

	""It strikes me that there is some worry within the Liberal ranks, at least to some degree,"" he said. ""They felt the need to show Iain Rankin as the premier being decisive.""

	In another unusual move, Liberal Finance Minister Labi Kousoulis called reporters to his campaign headquarters on Tuesday, where he criticized the fiscal plans of the Progressive Conservatives and NDP.

	In particular, he zeroed in on a Tory promise to return 50 per cent of the corporate taxes paid by companies that raise workers' salaries.

	""What it will do is take the burden off the largest corporations from ever having to pay another pay increase again,"" Kousoulis said. ""All future pay increases will be funded by Nova Scotia citizens.""

	Kousoulis told reporters the decision to hold a media session at his office was made in conjunction with party strategists.

	Urbaniak said that's a change from the start of the campaign, when the Liberals were happy to keep a lower profile and ""appear managerial.""

	""At this late stage, they seem to have changed that strategy and they are more directly confronting their opponents and trying to draw a contrast,"" he said.

	Still, Turnbull thinks voter turnout will ultimately tell the tale for the parties. She said turnout could dip below 50 per cent, adding that people who choose to vote could wait until the last minute to make up their minds.

	""There's not that polarizing person for everybody to get either really excited about and rally around or get really scared of and rally against,"" she said.

	Turnbull said the outcome will depend on how well party leaders propagate their messages and how organized and efficient party machines are in competitive ridings.

	Meanwhile, Elections Nova Scotia said a total of 75,367 early votes had been cast as of Monday -- more than twice the number at the same point during the 2017 election, when 32,935 early votes had been cast.

	In the 2017 election, 756,113 people registered to vote, and 403,366 people, representing 53.4 per cent of the electorate, cast a ballot.

	At dissolution, the Liberals held 24 of 51 seats, followed by the Progressive Conservatives with 17 and the NDP with five. There were three Independents and two seats were vacant.

	British Columbia identified 1,079 new cases of COVID-19 over the weekend and suffered five more deaths related to the disease, health officials announced Monday.

	The weekend's death toll matches the number of coronavirus-related fatalities suffered across the entire province over the previous 14 days combined.

	Four of the five deaths were recorded in the Interior Health region, where an alarming spike in transmission has led officials to re-introduce a number of tough COVID-19 restrictions in the Central Okanagan.

	And while the government did not provide any other details on the latest victims, such as their ages and immunization status, there has been a recent resurgence of coronavirus outbreaks in the province's long-term care homes – including at several under Interior Health's jurisdiction.

	Earlier on Monday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry addressed breakthrough cases of the extremely contagious Delta variant in long-term care facilities, which have generally high vaccination rates among residents.

	""What we have seen with the Delta variant is that once it gets in a high-risk setting like a long-term care home, it can spread very rapidly,"" Henry said. ""The risk is that it is being brought into long-term care homes by people who are unimmunized.""

	Officials have always acknowledged that vaccines are not 100 per cent effective in preventing infection, and Henry said immunization still dramatically reduces the risk of severe outcomes after catching COVID-19, even in vulnerable populations such as care home residents.

	The remaining risk has not convinced officials to mandate vaccination for employees in long-term care facilities, despite growing calls for them to do so, including from B.C.'s seniors advocate.

	The number of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the province also rose sharply in Monday's update, which came in the form of a written statement from the Ministry of Health. There are now 68 coronavirus patients in hospital, a jump of about 28 per cent from Friday, though the number of patient in intensive care dropped to 20 from 24.

	B.C.'s active case count surged to 3,036, an increase of about 600 from last week. The last time that figure topped 3,000 was more than two months ago.

	The latest infections also pushed the province's seven-day average for new infections to 355 cases per day, the highest that number's been in months as well.

	Once again, the majority of new cases – 587 of the 1,079 – came from the Interior Health region.

	It's been two weeks since officials imposed another mask mandate in the Central Okanagan, where most of the recent transmission has been occurring, but there has yet to be a decline in cases.

	Henry said there has been a ""levelling"" of infection numbers, however, and noted the more strict measures implemented last week, such as the closure of bars and nightclubs, should be having an effect soon.

	""We hope to see the impact of that in the next week,"" she said.

	Officials have said 95 per cent of recent cases have involved people who are unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated, many of them young people who have only had the opportunity for one shot.

	On Monday, officials announced they were decreasing the minimum interval between vaccine doses to four weeks, down from seven, in order to get more people protected as quickly as possible as the Delta variant spreads.

	“I am strongly recommending that people living in areas with outbreaks book their vaccines at the earliest date possible,” Henry said.

	The provincial health officer acknowledged a growing body of research that has found a longer interval to be more beneficial, but said that has to be weighted against the current risk of infection, at least in COVID-19 hotspots such as the Central Okanagan.

	As of Monday, the province has administered 7,067,738 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, including enough first shots for 82 per cent of the eligible population age 12 and older. Just over 72 per cent of eligible B.C. residents have received both doses.

	However, the Americans have yet to relax their rules for Canadian travellers.

	Travellers heading into Canada need to reside in the U.S. and be fully vaccinated for 14 days with a vaccine approved by Health Canada in order to be eligible.

	A labour dispute between the federal government and Canadian Border Service Agency employees was resolved last Friday, easing fears of long delays.

	But the screening process at customs will take longer than travellers experienced before the pandemic.

	The federal government has said it will allow vaccinated visitors from other countries besides the U.S. to return to Canada for non-essential reasons as of Sept. 7, which is the earliest day B.C. will move into the fourth and final stage of its COVID-19 reopening plan.

	May expects that eventually, vaccine rules like his will be commonplace. Next month, New York City will start requiring vaccinations to enter restaurants, gyms and theaters.

	But for now, customers are far more likely to encounter mask mandates. After lifting mask recommendations for fully vaccinated people in May, the CDC reversed course in late July, recommending masks for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people in areas of higher transmission.

	The shifting guidance has caused confusion over which rules to enforce and how. Walmart and Target, for instance, recently began requiring masks for employees ---- but not customers ---- in areas where virus transmission rates are high. McDonald's is requiring masks for both employees and customers. Home Depot's mask mandate is nationwide.

	A handful of places, like Louisiana, the San Francisco Bay area and Las Vegas, are mandating masks indoors.

	Many business owners didn't wait for the CDC or their local governments before acting. In mid-July, Tamra Patterson reinstituted a mask mandate and reduced seating capacity from 200 to 65 at Chef Tam's Underground Cafe, the restaurant she owns in Memphis, Tennessee.

	""I need every dollar and dime and penny I can get, but if I don't have employees healthy, I don't have a business. If customers are sick, I have nothing,"" Patterson said.

	Customers are generally receptive to the mask mandate, Patterson said. Only one has walked out.

	PanTerra Gallery, a women's clothing store in Bisbee, Arizona, reinstated a mask mandate for customers a few weeks ago after watching cases climb nationwide.

	""We're a tourist town, so it was just a matter of time before it reached us again,"" said Lisa Wines, a PanTerra employee. Most people are fine with the new mandate, she said, but some turn around and stomp out of the store.

	Not every business supports the mandates. Basilico's Pasta e Vino, a restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, has railed against masks on social media. A sign on its door requires patrons to prove that they're unvaccinated.

	Some workers also don't want to see masks return.

	Dru W., a grocery employee in Houston who asked not to use his full name for fear of reprisals at work, said he was fully vaccinated months ago and enjoys the freedom it gives him to go without a mask. Few stores around him are enforcing the new CDC guidelines, he said, and he won't either.

	""I didn't get both my doses and deal with the rather gnarly side effects only to be told to go back to the way things were during the pandemic,"" he said.

	But other retail workers see masks as an important way to end the pandemic. Austin Ray Shanks, who works at a Walmart in Monroe, Washington, said he finds masks uncomfortable but necessary. He's disappointed that many customers at his store refuse to wear them.

	Marshall Crawley said his gym in Morrisville, North Carolina, recently announced that it would require masks for both vaccinated and unvaccinated patrons. But the rule isn't being enforced, he said.

	""It doesn't really feel like it is doing much good wearing a mask when everyone around me is not,"" said Crawley, a client manager for J&J Editorial, a managed services company for scholarly publishing.

	Crawley thinks the CDC went too far when it told vaccinated people they could remove their masks this spring. Now, he said, it will be too hard to convince people to put them back on.

	Jose Backer, who works in customer service at a food packaging manufacturer in Los Angeles County, said his company began letting vaccinated workers remove their masks earlier this year. But soon everyone stopped wearing them. That angered Backer, who doesn't want a repeat of a COVID-19 outbreak that sickened him and others at his workplace last year. He's relieved that his county is requiring masks for everyone again.

	The new wave of mandates give some comfort to companies that never gave up on masks, even when U.S. cases ebbed earlier this summer.

	Liz Manasek, the co-owner of Warner Bodies, a custom truck manufacturer in Elwood, Indiana, kept a mask policy in place after watching other companies struggle with different rules for vaccinated and unvaccinated workers.

	About 60 per cent of the company's 105 employees are now vaccinated, she said. She has told employees she won't consider removing the mandate until that level reaches 80 per cent.

	Manasek has gotten some pushback from workers, but she reminds them that the policy has been effective. Only one or two employees have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic began, she said.

	""We've just got to hold out and keep on the basics,"" she said.

Ron DeSantis fails to protect medical privacy or prevent discrimination against unvaccinated people, but it does appear to violate the First Amendment rights of Norwegian Cruise Lines, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams wrote.

	In a nearly 60-page ruling issued late Sunday, the judge said Florida failed to ""provide a valid evidentiary, factual, or legal predicate"" for banning requirements that passengers prove they've been vaccinated. Norwegian has shown that suspending the requirement will jeopardize public health, potentially causing ""super-spreader"" events wherever passengers disembark, she wrote.

	Florida separately sued the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention seeking to block federal cruise ship vaccination requirements. The CDC lost on appeal, but then made its guidelines non-binding, and all cruise lines operating in Florida have agreed to keep following the CDC's instructions on a voluntary basis, the judge wrote.

	The CDC's current guidelines, in effect until Nov. 1, say cruise lines can sail again with confirmation that at least 95 percent of passengers and crew have been vaccinated, the judge noted.

	The plaintiffs are Surgeon General Scott Rivkees and the Florida Department of Health. The state's attorney, Pete Patterson, previously said the law's aim is to prevent invasions of privacy and discrimination against passengers who don't get vaccinated.

	DeSantis spokesperson Christina Pushaw said the state will appeal Williams' ruling. ""A prohibition on vaccine passports does not even implicate, let alone violate, anyone's speech rights, and it furthers the substantial, local interest of preventing discrimination among customers based on private health information,"" the statement said.

	The pandemic has cost Norwegian more than US$6 billion to date by forcing the company to dock its entire 28-vessel fleet and send nearly 30,000 crew members home. Each canceled seven-day voyage would cost the company another US$4 million, the judge noted.

	The Norwegian Gem is set to depart from Miami on Sunday -- the company's first voyage from Florida since the pandemic halted its operations. More than 1,200 passengers have already booked tickets, promising to prove they've been vaccinated before boarding, the judge noted.

	""We want nothing more than to sail from Miami, the Cruise Capital of the World, and from the other fabulous Florida ports,"" Frank Del Rio, president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, said in a statement. ""We welcome today's ruling that allows us to sail with 100% fully vaccinated guests and crew which we believe is the safest and most prudent way to resume cruise operations amid this global pandemic,

	Norwegian said that if it can't maintain its vaccination policy in Florida, it will have to cancel all voyages leaving from the state or allow unvaccinated passengers on board, and both options would cause significant financial and reputational harm.

	The entire business model of cruising depends on ships being able to cross federal, state, local and international jurisdictions in days or even hours, and each of them have different laws, regulations, and protocols, the judge noted. Belize, the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands and Honduras are among the foreign ports that require proof of vaccination to enter without quarantines or testing.

	This landscape of protocols is changing so markedly and frequently, especially as the delta variant becomes more widespread, that it's ""not only impractical, but also financially, legally and logistically onerous"" for cruise lines to comply without documentary proof of vaccinations, the ruling says.

	The Florida law threatens fines of up to US$5,000 per violation, but it fails to prevent discrimination or violations of medical privacy, since businesses can still discourage the unvaccinated in other ways, by posting ""vaccinated customers only"" signs, or by doing what some other cruise lines now do: They require onerous on-board COVID tests and banish unvaccinated passengers from on-ship activities and ports of call, the ruling says.

	As for privacy, Royal Caribbean punches a hole in the pass of unvaccinated patrons, and segregates them from others in the main dining room, the judge noted.

Idea of making COVID-19 vaccine mandatory for health-care workers is gaining momentum,"Aug. 7, 2021 6:58 a.m. CST","
     
     SAINT JOHN, N.B. - 
     
    
	For months, Maritimers have been lining up to get their shot of COVID-19 vaccine, making an individual decision to go out and get their dose. However, for health-care workers on the front-lines of the fight against the virus, the question of whether they should have to get it is gaining momentum.

	Two major medical groups in the country, the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) and the Canadian Nurses Association, have both come out with a call to make vaccines mandatory for health care workers.

	""With the Delta variant and sort of the changing landscape heading into fall, we felt it was really important to come out strongly that we felt mandatory vaccinations is the way to move forward,"" says incoming president of the CMA Dr. Katharine Smart.

United Airlines mandates COVID-19 vaccines for all employees,"Aug. 6, 2021 9:09 p.m. CST","
     
    
	United Airlines will join the growing list of companies that are requiring employees get vaccinated against COVID-19, the first major U.S. airline to implement such a mandate.

	A United executive said it was not considering a similar rule for passengers, and that any such requirement would be a decision for the government. 

    Advertisement
    
	United said while it has had discussions with its unions on the new rules it has not reached agreements with them.

	The airline set a late October deadline for employees to prove vaccination status, and said it could move earlier if a vaccine receives full federal approval sooner. Any employee who refuses to show proof of vaccination will be fired.

	United said the October deadline was driven by a sense of urgency to protect its workforce, their family members and its customers. It cited statistics that show that while there has been a surge in COVID cases among those who are vaccinated, those who have had one of the vaccines are far less likely to need to be hospitalized or die from the recent surge in the disease.

	A United spokesperson said the airline will consider on a case-by-case basis employees who have health or religious reasons not to be vaccinated, and that those employees will have to wear masks at all times.

	""We know some of you will disagree with this decision to require the vaccine for all United employees,"" the airline said in email to staff. ""But, we have no greater responsibility to you and your colleagues than to ensure your safety when you're at work, and the facts are crystal clear: everyone is safer when everyone is vaccinated.""

	United is also offering an additional day of pay for most employees who provide proof of vaccination by mid-September. The pay does not apply to United pilots and flight attendants who already have a union-negotiated incentive to be vaccinated.

	""Over the last 16 months, [CEO Scott Kirby] has sent dozens of condolences letters to the family members of United employees who have died from COVID-19. We're determined to do everything we can to try to keep another United family from receiving that letter,"" said the notice to United employees. ""Together we'll do our our part to defeat this virus.""

	United has required vaccines for new employees since mid-June. But those new employees are not yet part one of the unions that represent most of the employees at the airlines.

	Some 85% of United's 85,400 employees are represented by unions.

	Vaccine requirements by employers are becoming common. Among the other companies that have announced similar moves for some or all of its employees are Google, Disney, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Netflix, Tyson Foods and Walmart, the nation's largest private-sector employer.

	Walmart is requiring proof of vaccination only for corporate employees, not employees in its stores. And some of those employers, such as the tech companies and banks, have few unionized employees.

	Some of the other companies with vaccine mandates, such as Tyson and Disney are in the process of negotiating their mandates with their unions. Labor law covering the private sector generally requires changes in work conditions for represented employees to reached through collective bargaining agreements. And some of unions, while urging members to get vaccinated, have opposed vaccine mandates as a condition of employment.

	On Wednesday, federal Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said he is concerned about provinces lifting COVID-19 restrictions, as it could lead to a fourth wave among Indigenous people driven by the Delta variant.

	Miller’s comments came the day after Manitoba announced its latest reopening plan, which is set to take effect on Saturday. The plan includes lifting the mask mandate and allowing some businesses to fully reopen, including gyms, hair and nail salons, and retail businesses.

	Dumas recognized that the pandemic has been a tough time, and that he is looking forward to being able to go out without restrictions. However, he acknowledged that even though he is fully vaccinated, not everyone else is.

	“There’s still no vaccine for our children,” he said.

	“It’s great that all the adults have a bit of a buffer, a bit of a bubble so we can all try and get back to normal life. But school is starting in a month and I’m not too sure that we’ve done whatever we can to make schools as safe as possible for our children.”

	VACCINATION RATES

	According to the latest provincial data, 61.7 per cent of eligible First Nations people who live on reserves have been fully immunized, while 46.2 per cent of the eligible off-reserve population has received both doses.

	Dumas said he commends the leadership for taking proactive measures, but acknowledged the, “systemic issues that exist within the health-care system.”

	“We had an opportunity to try to highlight these things and provide solutions so we could move forward,” he said.

	“We were able to do that with great skill on-reserve, but unfortunately off-reserve, we don’t have the same authority or same effect on off-reserve issues.

	Dumas added that their leadership has been advocating for everyone to get vaccinated.

	Alberta's top doctor is defending the province's plan to lift all its COVID-19 public health restrictions despite mounting concerns from physicians and political leaders across Canada, including federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu.

	In a letter to Alberta Health Minister Tyler Shandro, Hajdu said she agrees with the Canadian Paediatric Society's description of the province's move as an “unnecessary and risky gamble.”

    Advertisement
    
	Hajdu said recent modelling for Alberta forecasts a more serious resurgence in cases fuelled by the Delta variant, and all governments need to take reasonable steps to protect Canadians.

       Alberta reports 397 new COVID-19 cases, 1 deathCOVID-19 'not the only wicked problem we are facing': Hinshaw in new op-ed

	“The vaccination campaign in Canada, one of the best in the world, has significantly changed the overall context of COVID-19 here,” wrote Hajdu. “However, it is still too early to declare victory.

	“Many remain unvaccinated, creating the potential for outbreaks, and we need to increase first and second dose coverage in order to protect against a Delta-driven resurgence that could seriously impact our citizens and our health system capacity.”

	Hajdu said she wants to better understand the rationale and science behind Alberta's decision.

	Last week, the province ended contract tracing and said close contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19 are not required to isolate. And starting Aug. 16, those infected will no longer need to quarantine.

	Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, told The Canadian Press on Thursday that the decision was made after her team reviewed data on age-specific outcomes related to COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness and modelling on transmission of the Delta variant and related health outcomes.

	Hinshaw said they also studied other jurisdictions, like the United Kingdom, which saw an uptick in the Delta variant before Alberta, to determine risks related to eliminating restrictions.

	“We expect that we'll see a rise in cases and they will continue to rise for about a month. But the impact on severe outcomes and on acute care will be greatly mitigated by vaccines,” said Hinshaw.

	While Hinshaw acknowledged concerns from Albertans about the “hard and rapid shift,” she said timing is the most important question.

	“What I think has not been a part of the conversation is the risk of maintaining the status quo,” she said.

	If Alberta continues to treat COVID-19 as its biggest risk and focuses all of its resources on it, the province will accumulate a backlog of other problems, Hinshaw explained.

	Dropping isolation, testing and contact tracing measures before the fall will help Alberta prepare for an expected spike in other respiratory illnesses, she said, and it will free up acute care and public health resources.

	Hinshaw stressed, however, that people who get sick with COVID-19 or any other transmissible illnesses should isolate despite not being legally required to.

	If Alberta's acute care system is again overwhelmed or a new variant poses a significant threat, Hinshaw said the province will reconsider reinstating public health measures.

	Shandro declined to comment on Hajdu's letter Thursday, but criticized the federal minister on social media.

	“Minister Hajdu noticeably neglected to write a letter to Saskatchewan despite (us) having similar approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, Ms. Hajdu chose to target Alberta - the Trudeau Liberals' favourite punching bag,” he wrote, before condemning the federal government's track record on addressing COVID-19.

	Shandro said Hinshaw and her team's recommendations to lift health measures are “in line with the science.”

	In a recent editorial, Hinshaw apologized for causing some people “confusion, fear or anger” but said the changes will help support the whole health of Albertans.

       Moderna - Earnings report, Aug. 5, 2021

	The COVID-19 vaccine is Moderna's only commercially approved product. It also is developing several vaccines that aim to guard against the flu, Zika and HIV among other viruses. Those are all in early stages of clinical testing, according to its website.

	The company also is testing a potential booster shot for the COVID-19 vaccine.

	Overall, Moderna earned $2.78 billion in the second quarter, compared to a loss of $117,000 last year, before its vaccine received emergency use authorization in the U.S. and other countries to fight the global pandemic.

	The company brought in $4.35 billion in total revenue, thanks to the vaccine and some grants. Earnings per share totaled $6.46.

	The results topped Wall Street expectations. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research expected, on average, earnings of $6.01 per share on $4.29 billion in revenue.

	Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine has received emergency authorization for use in more than 50 countries.

	Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. also said Thursday that it completed enrollment in an early-stage study of its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine, which could be easier to store and distribute. The company also said it will explore a combination vaccine that aims to offer protection against the flu, COVID-19 and other viruses.

	Company shares fell 4% to $402 in premarket trading Thursday. The stock price has quadrupled since the end of 2020.

'We want businesses to stay open': St. Thomas chamber promotes vaccination with new video,"Aug. 5, 2021 3:19 a.m. CST","
     
     St. Thomas, Ont. - 
     
    
	In the Southwestern Public Health (SWPH) region, 79 per cent of those 12+ have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 65 per cent have two shots.

	In an effort to push that number higher, the St. Thomas and District Chamber of Commerce (STDCC) has produced a promotional video called 'This is our Shot,' encouraging those in Elgin County to get vaccinated.

	""Ultimately we want to support our small business community as much as possible to allow people to shop support local and get out there so we can open our businesses and make sure that they stay open,"" says Paul Jenkins, CEO of the STDCC.

	Businesses across the county participated, holding up signs explaining why they got their vaccine.

	""A lot of small businesses are just hanging by their fingertips right now trying to get through,"" says Chris Patriquin, owner of Simply Pure Water in St. Thomas.

	""It's an important time for businesses right now to stay open. This is a tool that we can use to keep businesses open and avoid lock downs in the future.""

	For Chris and Jame Patriquin, it's not just about business. They are looking out for family and the community.

	""We've got a brand new grandson now he's just six weeks old, so I mean it's important to us that we protect him keep him safe as well as his family and the rest of our family,"" Chris adds.

	The STDCC campaign is concurrent with SWHP's 'Vaccination is Key,' and the St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital is also pushing vaccinations.

	Jenkins feels the entire community, including elected officials, have been working hard since the beginning of the pandemic to encourage vaccination.

	""People spend about a third of their day, every day, at work,"" says Dr. Joyce Lock, medical officer of health for SWPH.

	""By getting the messages to our workers, we can reach more people. Also, all of us, we attend those workplaces, and they're an important part of our lives. We want to give back to the restaurants and to the shops, and to our recreational facilities.""

	Currently Jenkins says no businesses in the STDCC are requiring vaccination for entry, but that could potentially change in the coming months. For now, they want to reduce vaccine reluctance, and improve on that 79 per cent vaccination number.

	""We understand that there's reluctance, that's exactly why we're doing it,"" says Jenkins.

	""We're not trying to meet folks that have questions about this with any smugness it's simply, you want it. If you do have concerns, if you do have questions we're going to put the experts that are the local experts right in front of you and make sure that you have an opportunity to ask these questions.

Windsor-Essex schools likely to 'adopt the plan as presented' for back to school: Dr. Ahmed,"Aug. 5, 2021 6:44 a.m. CST","

	Students will be able to participate in both indoor and outdoor extra-curricular activities, regardless of their COVID-19 vaccine status when school resumes in September, according to Ontario’s medical officer of health.

	Dr. Kieran Moore made the announcement Wednesday, just a day after the province unveiled its back-to-school plan for September.

	“We would like to allow broad based participation within those sports knowing that we want to have as close to return to normal as we can and have the benefit of the social, mental and physical well-being of our children,” Moore said.

	Ontario’s top doctor said it was an omission in Tuesday’s plan, but after consulting with local public health units and sports leagues, he feels comfortable it will be possible, while managing risk.

	Moore also noted a student’s ability to participate will not depend on their vaccine status.

	“There shouldn’t be any barriers or stigmatization of children who have not received a vaccine in any way in normal activities throughout the school year,” said Moore.

	WINDSOR-ESSEX BOARDS REVIEWING PLAN

	It’s a plan that school boards are currently reviewing.

	“We understand that extracurricular activities are an extremely important part of every child’s education. Whether it’s athletics, arts, or clubs, these activities play an essential role in their social development and in the promotion of positive mental health,” said Emelda Byrne, the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board’s director of education in a statement.

	She added that the board will “review and refine” those plans as it meets with the health unit over the coming weeks

	“An essential part of that will be determining which extracurricular activities we can safely offer without encouraging the spread of COVID-19,” Byrne said.

	The same goes for the public school board.

	“We are in the process of developing plans for return to school based on recent ministry announcements and we will be seeking the advice of WECHU to ensure a safe return to in-person learning,” said public school board director of education Erin Kelly. “We will provide more details with respect to extra-curricular, ventilation, contact tracing etc. as we get additional information. We are excited to welcome our students back into our schools.”

	WECHU MEETING WITH SCHOOL BOARDS

	Health Unit medical officer of health Dr. Wajid Ahmed says he’s reviewed the plans and will continue to meet with school board officials over the next month.

	“If the situation changes within our community we’ll have to adapt and update the plan accordingly, but at this point, I would anticipate that we will adopt the plan as presented,” said Ahmed.

	He tells CTV News the best way to ensure a safe return to school is by getting vaccinated, especially those in the 12-17 age group, noting it’s also the best way to ensure in-person learning continues throughout the year.

	“Let’s hope we don’t have to go back to another closure of the school system, but it is important to understand that could be a possibility, depending on how the fourth wave evolves here,” he said.

"Surge in infections: 342 new COVID-19 cases in B.C., most since late May","Aug. 5, 2021 9:45 a.m. CST","
     
     Vancouver - 
     
    
	B.C. health officials announced 342 more cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, the largest daily increase in the province's caseload since late May.

	Half of the latest cases, 171, were in the Interior Health region, which has been driving the recent surge in infections in B.C.

    Advertisement
    
	Wednesday's numbers came in a written statement from the provincial Ministry of Health, and brought the rolling seven-day average of daily new cases detected in the province over 200 for the first time since early June.

	The 342 new cases is the highest single-day total since May 27, when B.C. saw 378 new infections.

	No new deaths were reported Wednesday. Since the pandemic began, there have been 150,973 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in B.C. and 1,772 deaths.

	There are currently 1,764 active cases of the coronavirus in B.C. Of that total, 55 people are in hospital, 23 of them in intensive care.

	Most of the active cases - 945 of them - are in Interior Health, where officials recently declared an outbreak and reimposed mandatory mask-wearing in the Central Okanagan local health area.

	Elsewhere in the province, Fraser Health added 66 new cases on Wednesday, Vancouver Coastal Health added 57, Island Health added 32 and Northern Health added 13.

	Three new infections reported Wednesday were found in people who normally reside outside Canada.

	The Ministry of Health does not provide information in its daily case updates on how many people who tested positive have been vaccinated against COVID-19.

	Asked last week whether the province would start providing that information, Health Minister Adrian Dix told reporters it's reported differently within the provincial system and not easy to put out on a daily basis.

	Health officials have repeatedly said that the vast majority of cases seen in the province are among unvaccinated people, with only about four per cent of infections coming in people who have had both shots and the necessary time to develop antibodies after the second. 

	The recent surge has largely been driven by Interior Health, where vaccination rates are lower. Experts have also pointed to the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus as a reason for the surge. 

	Three new outbreaks of COVID-19 have recently been declared in care homes in the Interior Health region, according to Wednesday's update.

	Those outbreaks are at Kootenay Street Village in Cranbrook and Cottonwoods Care Centre and Brookhaven Care Centre, both in Kelowna.

	The number of outbreaks in long-term care homes in B.C. has plummeted since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines began in late December of last year.

	As of Wednesday, 81.5 per cent of eligible people ages 12 and older had received at least a first dose of vaccine in B.C., and 67.9 per cent of that age group had received a second shot.

COVID-19 'not the only wicked problem we are facing': Hinshaw in new op-ed,"Aug. 5, 2021 3:46 a.m. CST","
     
     EDMONTON - 
     
    
	After days of unrelenting criticism of Alberta's plan to change its pandemic response, the province's top doctor is again attempting to assure Albertans it's time to rely on the protection of vaccines and live with COVID-19.

	""The majority of our public health resources have been directed at the COVID-19 response, as has been necessary. That has come at the cost of not fully working on other threats, like syphilis and opioid deaths,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw wrote in an op-ed shared with media on Wednesday.

    Advertisement
    
	""As vaccine coverage has changed the nature of the province-wide risk of COVID-19, it is time, in my opinion, to shift from province-wide extraordinary measures to more targeted and local measures.

	""This allows us to start looking at other issues while still continuing COVID-19 protective measures in areas of high risk, and responding to local outbreaks where the health system is under threat.""

	The letter to Albertans – in which she apologized for leaving some with the impression the pandemic was over or that the public were being left to manage COVID-19 alone – came exactly one week after she announced the province would no longer require close contacts of COVID-19 cases to quarantine and, starting mid-August, move from requiring to recommending quarantine for positive cases. That day, masks will no longer be mandatory in public transit, and two weeks later, COVID-19 tests will only be available to physicians needing a diagnosis to decide patient care.  

	In Wednesday's op-ed, Hinshaw called testing ""every person with a runny nose or sore throat"" an extraordinary measure that is especially unsustainable during the fall, and isolation mandates necessary before vaccines but unjustifiable after.

	""COVID-19 is a wicked problem; experts don’t always agree on the exact nature of the problem, much less the best approach. But it is not the only wicked problem we are facing together,"" Hinshaw wrote.

	
		
			Dr. Hinshaw Op-ed Aug 4 2021 by CTV News Edmonton on Scribd
		


	DOCS ASK PROVINCE TO REVERSE DECISION

	As of Tuesday, Alberta had roughly 2,200 active cases with 90 Albertans in hospitals and ICUs. The seven-day average for the province's test positivity rate rose to 3.13 per cent, about where it was mid-June. On July 29, the province limited testing to symptomatic individuals only.

	Of the eligible population, 76 per cent of Albertans have had a first dose of vaccine, and 65.8 per cent a second.

	As Hinshaw reiterated in the op-ed, the province will continue to watch COVID-19 trends and respond to local threats.

	Some health care professionals found the letter lacking in scientific data. As the Edmonton Zone Medical Staff Association noted in an Aug. 4 letter addressed to Premier Jason Kenney, Alberta's rate of transmission sits at its highest yet, at 1.5. It says with an easing of public health measures like masking and the higher transmissibility of the Delta variant, Alberta is likely in the early stages of a fourth wave which could see 1.5 million unvaccinated adults and more than 650,000 unvaccinated children under 12 get sick. It asked the government to hold off on the changes announced by Hinshaw until vaccines are approved for children under 12, 85 per cent of Alberta's total population is fully immunized, and Health Canada declares the pandemic over.

	The change in direction of Alberta's COVID-19 response has been loudly criticized by Opposition government members, medical professionals and residents concerned about a looming fourth wave or sending unvaccinated children to school.

	Daily rallies protesting the change have been organized at the Alberta legislature in Edmonton as well as in Calgary by an ER physician who characterized the shift as insane and ""an experiment.""

	Some have accused Hinshaw of resisting best scientific evidence by bending to the political whims of Alberta's United Conservative government.

	Meanwhile, Kenney and Health Minister Tyler Shandro have coloured the transition as ""the inevitable next step"" and backed the top doctor.

	Kenney said on Tuesday, ""I think it's regrettable that we've seen comments attacking the expertise of our brilliant chief medical officer of health… I would call on anybody in a position of authority, especially elected leadership, to show a degree of respect for the chief medical officer of health and the advice she provides.""

	He said Hinshaw and her team approached his government with the proposal on July 8, which cabinet accepted ""without modification.""

	“This was a package of measures that came forward from the chief medical officer and her team and we respect their data-driven, scientific advice,” said Kenney.

	The comments were Kenney's first on COVID-19 since Hinshaw announced the restriction changes last Wednesday.

	The ministry of health did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment about the specific data guiding Alberta's strategy. In a previous statement, Alberta Health acknowledged the province was one of the first to move forward with the approach and pointed to vaccine uptake.

	Close contacts of individuals who test positive for the virus are no longer required to isolate, nor are they notified by contact tracers. Come Aug. 16, people infected with COVID-19 will also not be legally required to isolate - though it is recommended.

	Kenney said Hinshaw presented the plan to members of the government July 8 and they accepted it without modification.

	Health Minister Tyler Shandro similarly diverted to Hinshaw last week when he defended the province's response.

	Hinshaw has previously said she presents the government with scientific evidence, numbers and trends, but the final decision on how to respond to pandemic developments lies with the province.

	Dr. Lorian Hardcastle, a health policy expert at the University of Calgary, said Alberta is likely the first jurisdiction in Canada to eliminate all COVID-19 safety measures.

	Many consider the move premature as cases continue to grow. Alberta recorded 743 new cases of COVID-19 over the last four days, bringing the active case count to 2,176.

	“We have seen some American jurisdictions dial back their restrictions quite significantly, and have for quite a few months, but the reason this goes so far is it eliminates some of those basic public health measures,” said Hardcastle.

	“The contact tracing, testing and positive cases staying home are really just fundamental public health restrictions.”

	She said earlier steps to allow gatherings and businesses to reopen may have been a concern for individuals, but government officials often modelled the decisions on other jurisdictions.

	“There was at least a point of comparison,” said Hardcastle. “In this case ... we're the guinea pig.”

	Hundreds of Albertans have attended multiple protests in Calgary and Edmonton since Hinshaw announced the changes. Attendees have called on the province to walk back its plan.

	Alberta's Opposition New Democratic Party is also calling for a public inquiry into Kenney and his United Conservative government's handling of the COVID-19 crisis.

	Sarah Hoffman, who is deputy leader for the NDP, said an independent review is necessary. She said it's also needed because of reports the government won't release a report into the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

	However, Health Minister Tyler Shandro later said on Twitter that the interim report will be released later this week.

	“It is clear that Albertans can no longer trust their own government to keep them safe,” Hoffman said.

	“A full public inquiry is necessary because it allows Albertans to understand what happened over the course of this pandemic and to plan for the future, so we don't repeat the same poor decision-making process again.”

Manitoba task force 'seriously considering' school-based COVID-19 immunizations for young students,"Aug. 4, 2021 6:41 a.m. CST","
     
     WINNIPEG - 
     
    
	The medical lead of Manitoba's Vaccine Implementation Task Force says the province is seriously considering a school-based immunization rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine for young students once Health Canada approves vaccines for children under 12.

	For now, only children between the ages of 12 and 17 can roll up their sleeves for a Pfizer shot in Canada.

	Dr. Joss Reimer, the medical lead of the vaccine task force, said Pfizer is currently working on studies regarding the vaccinations of children under 12. She said the earliest Health Canada might approve the vaccines for children is estimated to be in October.

	As for what Manitoba's vaccine rollout for children under 12 will look like—that is yet to be determined.

	Reimer said the task force is still working on its plans, but it is eyeing the possibility of bringing the vaccine to students in schools.

	""Because we have done school-based vaccines for many years, that is something we are seriously considering for COVID as well,"" she said, adding no plans have been finalized.

	""We are working with education to assess the feasibility of running COVID immunization clinics as well as our routine school-based immunization clinics in the schools this year, and we are also trying to take into account how any plans might have to be adjusted if we did see a fourth wave, for example.""

	She said school-based COVID-19 immunization programs would be a good way to reach children who otherwise would not be able to get a vaccine at other immunization sites.

	""It is something that not only takes advantage of the fact that children are all in the same location, but also is something that people are familiar with and comfortable with because we have done it for so many years with other vaccines,"" Reimer said.

	She said when it comes to consenting to a vaccine there is no strict age cut-off. However, Reimer said public health tries to ensure the person who is consenting—regardless of their age—understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the decision they are making.

	""There is very few, if any, at younger ages who do have that capacity, so parental consent becomes more and more of a requirement the younger that we get,"" Reimer said. ""But there is no strict cut-off for this vaccine, nor is there for any other service in health-care, and we plan to follow the same processes that have been in place for decades.""

	Dr. Brent Roussin, the chief provincial public health officer, said younger children are at a smaller risk of severe outcomes due to COVID-19.

	He said given Manitoba's COVID-19 numbers and vaccine rates, the province believes students will be able to return to school this fall.

	He said more details about the return to school will be released later this week.

	As of Tuesday, 80 per cent of Manitobans age 12 and up have been vaccinated with at least one dose, while 71.4 per cent have received both doses.

	Roughly 3,300 rapid COVID-19 tests were completed last week at various pop-up sites in Nov Scotia.

	At this time, the province says they are not winding down COVID-19 testing but are considering modifications as necessary.
	While testing numbers may be going down, the number of people getting vaccinated continues to climb.

	As of Aug. 2, 1,360,660 doses of COVID-19-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 620,557 Nova Scotians have received their second dose.

	There are tens of thousands of vacant appointments available across the province in the next two weeks for those looking for a shot.

	""People can go nearly anywhere and get their second dose or their first dose, said Tracey Barbrick, the associate deputy minister in charge of the vaccine rollout.

	The province's goal is to get 75 per cent of Nova Scotians fully vaccinated by September, which is the next step in reducing public health restrictions.

	Health officials would like to see those who are eligible for their second dose move their appointment up.

	""Borders are opening and we've got some countries already seeing a fourth wave starting to make its way around so we of course want to have people with full immunity as soon as we can,"" said Barbrick.

	Community vaccine clinics are now starting to wind down and by the middle of August pharmacies will be the main provider of COVID-19 vaccines in the province.

Vaccination clinic at WFCU Centre administers last COVID-19 shot over weekend,"Aug. 4, 2021 3:42 a.m. CST","
     
     Windsor, Ont.  - 
     
    
	After delivering more than 72,000 COVID-19 vaccinations since March, the WFCU Centre clinic provided its last shot over the weekend.

	The mass-vaccination clinic operated out of the WFCU Centre closed on Saturday and began its transition back to regular community use.

	“Our staff, working alongside our vaccination partners from the healthcare sector did a tremendous job at the WFCU Centre, and on behalf of our community I thank them for it,” said Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens. “But the work is not done; we continue to help provide support for the efforts that are now taking place at the former Sears site in Devonshire Mall, and I encourage everyone who hasn’t received their vaccination to do so there as soon as possible.”

	By the numbers:

	
		The average duration (in minutes) of a visit was 36:37 from start to finish.
	
		The average wait for registration was 2:11.

		The average time allotted for recovery time was 15:00.
	
		There were approximately 133 City staff assisting at the WFCU Centre.


	Redeployed city staff are still supporting vaccination efforts by working at the call centre which is operated out of the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) in Windsor. Those efforts will be transferred to the Sears vaccination clinic this week, the city says.

	“When you look at the calls taken, whether they were general sign-up or information calls, or in some cases calls to allay concerns, the staff working at this temporary call centre location have done a tremendous job,” Dilkens said.

	The city says between March 23 and July 28 the call centre has answered 111,049 calls and 40,712 outbound calls made for a total of 151,761 public interactions surrounding vaccination information.

	Vaccination clinics are still open at the Libro Credit Union Center in Amherstburg, Nature Fresh Farms Recreation Centre in Leamington and the former Sears building at the Devonshire Mall in Windsor.

	The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit also regularly hosts pop-up vaccination clinics. This week the health unit will hold clinics at the Housing Homelessness and Health Hub (H4) at the Windsor Water World and the University of Windsor (Education Parking Lot) daily from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. or until supplies last.

	On Wednesday, anyone who is 12 and older can drop in for a first vaccine dose at their local vaccine clinic, and anyone who received their first dose before June 16 can drop in for their second dose. You will need to bring photo ID, and be prepared to receive either of the mRNA vaccines, Pfizer or Moderna. If you’re getting your second dose you’re encouraged to bring your proof-of-immunization record, but it’s not strictly required.

	Some clinics will also have live music, and the Squamish and Whistler clinics will include an appearance of the Whitecaps’ team mascot, Spike.

	For many, the process of getting a vaccine has required that they book their appointment through the province’s online vaccine portal. In many instances, this has required careful personal planning and scheduling. However, in recent weeks, there’s been a push to make vaccines more accessible by hosting walk-in clinics in communities across B.C.

	For those who can’t make it to Walk-in Wednesday, it’s still worth checking for other walk-in vaccine times. There’s a list that includes the time and place of future walk-in clinic times across the province, available on the Vax for BC website.

"Emergency public health order 'may benefit' northern Sask. communities as COVID-19 cases climb, official says","Aug. 1, 2021 2:53 a.m. CST","
     
     SASKATOON - 
     
    
	A northern Saskatchewan health official says an emergency public health order (PHO) could help clamp down on COVID-19 cases in an area that has seen a more than three-fold increase in cases since the start of the month.

	According to the latest situation report from the Athabasca Health Authority (AHA), the region it serves reported 41 active cases as of Friday — a 360 per cent climb in active cases since July 1.

    Advertisement
    
	Thirty-eight of the active cases are concentrated in Black Lake First Nation, a community that has only seen a three per cent rise in the number of fully vaccinated people over the same period, the report says.

	Currently, one in seven people are fully vaccinated in the community which has been under an outbreak declaration since June 23, according to the report prepared by AHA primary health care director Taiwo Olubanwo.

	Six variant cases have been identified in the community so far since the start of the outbreak, according to the document obtained by CTV News.

	The community of more than 1,600 people went into lockdown earlier this week, strictly limiting access to facilities, discouraging travel and advising community members to stay at home. 

	The lockdown is expected to remain in place until August 5.

	While Olubanwo describes the community's overall response to the recent public health measures as ""promising,"" he also feels action from provincial health officials may be required if the active case count continues to climb.

	""A prompt review and perhaps emergency PHO may benefit some northern communities,"" Olubanwo writes.

	""This is essential as the lifted PHO indeed makes it challenging ... to enforce the recommended movement restrictions particularly in some parts of northern Saskatchewan,"" Olubanwo said, referencing the province-wide lifting of COVID-19 restrictions earlier this month.

	Olubanwo says work is underway to help close the vaccine gap between northern Saskatchewan and the rest of the province, particularly by enlisting the help of elders.

	""We want the community to make an informed decision without having a feeling that they have been forced into taking the vaccine,"" Olubanwo writes.

	""The elders and leadership will help validate and share their experiences related to the vaccine using a culturally sensitive approach.""

	The report also says a shortage of healthcare workers is a concern and that the AHA is actively recruiting staff to try and head off burnout among frontline workers.

	Michael Andrew, who made waves for saying he wasn't vaccinated against COVID-19, didn't wear a mask behind the scenes after swimming his final at the Tokyo Olympics on Friday.

	The 22-year-old American was maskless when he stopped to speak with reporters in the mixed zone, an area where journalists interview athletes after events.

	Most swimmers wear face coverings outside of the pool, while media and workers are required to don face coverings at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre. But the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee said Andrew didn't violate COVID-19 protocol, because athletes are allowed to remove masks during interviews in the mixed zone, even though most keep their masks on.

	Asked why he wasn't wearing a mask, Andrew said, ""For me, it's pretty hard to breathe in after kind of sacrificing my body in the water, so I feel like my health is a little more tied to being able to breathe than protecting what's coming out of my mouth.""

	Andrew finished fifth in the 200-meter individual medley. He was to return Friday night to swim in the 50 free preliminaries.

	""I think it's great that there's procedures but at the end of the day, all of us here have been under quarantine and in the same testing protocol, so there's a level of safety that's comfortable when we're racing,"" he said.

	The Tokyo organizing committee's policy states that following a competition all athletes must wear masks, but that masks can be removed during media interviews in the mixed zone.

	The USOOC said after talking to Andrew and reviewing the Games Playbook, they determined he wasn't violating the policy.

	""Michael has been reminded of the Games policy and established COVID mitigation protocols, and has acknowledged the importance of following all guidelines intended to keep athletes and the community safe,"" the USOOC said in a statement.

	While there's been a raging debate in the U.S. about wearing masks, nearly everyone on the streets of Tokyo wears face coverings. Coronavirus infection cases have reached daily records in Tokyo, and the Japanese government has declared the capital and several other regions under a state of emergency during the games.

	Andrew was already under scrutiny for his decision not to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus.

	""My reason behind it is, for one, it was kind of a last moment, I didn't want to put anything in my body that I didn't know how I would potentially react to,"" Andrew said during a pre-Olympic training camp in Hawaii this month.

	""As an athlete on the elite level, everything we do is very calculated and understood. For me, in the training cycle, especially leading up to trials, I didn't want to risk any days out. There were periods where you take a vaccine, you have to deal with some days off.""

	Andrew has said he has no plans to be vaccinated in the future.

		Dr. Hinshaw explains Alberta's easing of mandatory masks, isolation requirements


	Alberta’s approach comes as countries with even higher overall vaccination rates, like Spain and the United Kingdom, are experiencing surges in infections leading to increased hospitalizations and deaths.

	Ryan Imgrund, a COVID-19 biostatistician from Sudbury, Ont., working with public health units in the province, told CTV News that Alberta is an outlier when it comes to policy responding to the pandemic and reproductive values.

	“The data and the science is definitely not guiding the policy in Alberta,” he said. “As far as I know right now, Alberta is the only place in the world that will be allowing COVID positive people to not have to self-isolate,” he added.

	“The only place in the world. We are talking Florida, the United Kingdom; all those places, they not only require someone that is COVID positive to self-isolate, but they also require those that are close contacts to also isolate as well.”

	Seventy-five per cent of the population aged 12 and older have received at least one dose of vaccine while 64.6 per cent of those eligible for vaccination are fully immunized.

	‘WORRISOME’ APPROACH: EPIDEMIOLOGIST

	Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, a U.S.-based epidemiologist and senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, said Alberta’s policy shifts caught his attention.

	“This is really worrisome,” Feigl-Ding said. “Even if you are vaccinated, I know (Hinshaw) cited that there is a high vaccination rate, you can still get infected, and even if you are not hospitalized you can still transmit COVID-19.

	“Long COVID is serious,” he added. “This is where to stop COVID transmission, to stop future variants, you have to stop the transmission chain. A positive person not isolating is just the worst possible recipe of keeping the virus still spreading.”

	His biggest concern with the policy direction Alberta has announced is that quarantine rules will be relaxed at a time when case counts are rising and that the province has one of the highest reproductive values in Canada.

	“They’re doing all this amid the highest, fastest surge in terms of rates of increase,” Feighl-Ding said. “It is antithetical to public health.”

	

			A Flourish chart


	OTHER PROVINCES KEEP QUARANTINE REQUIREMENTS

	Saskatchewan has “Living with COVID” language in their public health policies like Alberta, but isolation requirements remain in effect.

	“COVID-19 is a communicable disease reportable under the Public Health Act,” said Paul Merriman, Saskatchewan’s minister of health, in a statement to CTV News.

	Merriman said that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 in Saskatchewan must self-isolate, or risk receiving a $2,800 fine.

	“This direction has been and continues to be provided by public health officials to all individuals who test positive for COVID-19.

	“As with all communicable diseases, contact traces from public health will follow up with anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 in order to conduct an investigation and provide counselling,” the minister added.

	Meanwhile, British Columbia is reinstating masking restrictions in the province's central interior in the hopes of containing a COVID-19 outbreak.

	The policy shifts around quarantining means the rate of community transmission could increase, Imgrund said.

	“This is really going to really force this to become endemic. It is going to lead to a drastic increase in hospitalizations.”

	For Imgrund, the step of removing quarantine requirements is not inevitable now, but six months from now — at the earliest.

	“This is the next step when we are successfully able to vaccinate the under 12 population,” he shared.  “This is not the next step when 55 per cent of a population have been vaccinated.”

	For more than four months now, pharmacists in New Brunswick have been going ‘flat out,’ administering nearly 450,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines and counting.

	“All of this, of course, is on top of the other work that they do,” says Jake Reid, executive director of New Brunswick Pharmacists’ Association.

	“Including giving out medications, and providing health services, so it’s been very, very busy for pharmacists.”

	New Brunswick has now vaccinated more than 81 per cent of the eligible population with a first dose and more than 66 per cent have now received their second dose.

	However, the New Brunswick Pharmacists’ Association says demand for COVID-19 vaccines is dropping and about 30 community pharmacies in the province have now opted-out of the vaccine program, with 179 now active.

	“That’s certainly something we expected and not something anyone should be worried about,” says Reid. “There is a de-escalation happening right now as pharmacy staff take some time for themselves.”

	A wind-down is also coming in the way Public Health reports its COVID-19 information. Once the province goes green – which is scheduled to happen on July 30 at 11:59 p.m. – news releases on cases and vaccination rates will no longer be routinely posted on weekdays.

	“I think for me that’s where I get my information, in terms of case origin information,” says Halifax-based epidemiologist Kevin Wilson.

	“Although I think if you wanted to, you could extrapolate that from the dashboard day-after-day, although I think it’s more work.”

	However, there’s still some skepticism about the province’s plans to lift the mandatory order – including from infectious disease expert Dr. Lisa Barrett, who made her position on New Brunswick’s dropping of the mask mandate combined with the opening of borders.

	“Do I think that doing the two before you reach your vaccine target is based in science? I don’t really think so.”

	There are currently 1,005 active cases of COVID-19 in B.C., including 51 active cases in the island region, according to a statement Thursday from the health ministry.

	The ministry said in its statement, however, that the numbers are provisional due to a delay in data reporting and are therefore subject to change.

	A discrepancy in the daily COVID-19 numbers was apparent in the BCCDC's count, which recorded 15 new cases in the Vancouver Island region Thursday, and 202 new cases in B.C.

	There is currently one person in hospital with COVID-19 in the island region and no one in critical care, according to the BCCDC.

	Island Health officials identified the locations of 48 active cases in the island region Thursday, including 29 in the South Island, 17 in the Central Island and two in the North Island.

	There were no deaths from the disease reported in B.C. on Thursday, leaving the province's pandemic death toll at 1,771.

	Since the pandemic began, 41 people have died of COVID-19 in the Island Health region.

	""We are seeing an increase in cases – not unexpected in most places,"" said provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry during an unrelated news conference Thursday.

	""As we mentioned yesterday, we have had a rapid increase in one area of the province and there are additional measures that are in place in that area to try and prevent transmission,"" Henry added.

	The provincial health officer also advised out-of-province travellers to only visit B.C. once they have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine.

	""We're happy to have you come, fully vaccinated,"" Henry said. 

	As of Thursday, 81 per cent of British Columbians aged 12 and older have received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, while 64.1 per cent have received two doses.

	B.C. health-care workers have administered 6,732,309 doses of COVID-19 vaccine since the vaccines became available in December.

	While the number new cases have dramatically slowed – no new cases have been reported in two days – there is a disturbing trend underlying the numbers: the extremely contagious Delta variant, which has sparked a surge of new infections among the unvaccinated south of the border.

	""The more transmissible and dangerous COVID-19 Delta variant is now dominant in the area,"" the health unit said in its weekly roundup.

	""Since July 1 … the majority (70 per cent) of COVID-19 cases reported in the Public Health Sudbury & Districts area are infected with a variant that has the Delta (B.1.617.2) mutation profile.""

	“The Delta variant can spread more easily and is associated with higher rates of hospitalization, ICU admission and death as compared with the Alpha variant,” Dr. Penny Sutcliffe, medical officer of health, said in a news release.

	“COVID-19 vaccines are effective against Delta, but there is evidence of reduced protection against symptomatic disease after one dose. This means that two-dose vaccine coverage is important for everyone.

	""Also, given how infectious Delta is, vaccination rates need to be as high as possible to protect against community spread. If you were waiting for yet another reason to get immunized, here it is,” she added.
